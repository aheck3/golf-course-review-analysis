The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,This course was so much fun to play and the surroundings were absolutely beautiful. For it being November there was still a lot of green out there.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Love the course. One of my favorites Only issue I have is that range was closed and I did not receive notification that it was.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Great layout and course that feels like you are not playing golf in Indiana. Pace of play was slower than normal on a busy fall day.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Some of the greens were spikedIf not, it would have been a 5+Pete Dye didn’t disappointWe will be back"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"We had a great time playing this course today before all leave fall, cousre and weather conditons are perfect!"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,I cut my teeth on this course back in the 80’s. It was tough then. Mr Dye has made it even tougher!In my opinion it’s my “Augusta.”
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Come play it, keep it in the short grass!"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Fantastic course with friendly staff in a close to Indy location.One of my favorites.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Way too slow3 groups backed up from number 4Did not really open up much
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Greens in good shape with a few edge bad spots. Tees and fairways excellent. Some bunkers were in only fair condition. Course was backed up with a bit of slow play. 5 hour round. Love the course. The staff was outstanding firm the pro shop, starter. And cart lady. I will try to make it back!"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Wonderful experience. Very good golf course. Definitely coming back when I am in town.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"With the exception of unrepaired divots on the greens, course was n great shape. Need everyone to repair their own divots!"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Great course, only complaint is sand traps we not groomed/raked. So every time I was in the bunker I would move my ball rake it then put ball back down for my shot."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Pace of play was great and we were able to get all 18 holes in beginning at 5:20. Course was in great condition and we had no wait time at all until the last 2 holes but it was not long. It was hot and the thermos's of water were all empty but 1. We should have brought more water with us, because there was not beverage cart out there either."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"We got hooked up with 2 great golfers and they put up with us. We had great weather the fron 9, but then it got a bit windy and rainy on the back nine. We had a few brief showers and the downpour stayed away until the last hole!"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"The course was beautiful but it was cart path only , which made a round of golf take alot longer , the 2 guys that worked in the golf shop could use some training on people skills, at least to minorities"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Wonderful afternoon. We had no wait times until we got to the back 9, then teams got a bit backed up. Course was in good shape, but alot of the bunkers were hard and not worked up."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,We had a wonderful day of golf and other than a couple short sprinkles we were able to get 18 holes in!
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Always like playing the fort. Great shape, great layout, fun to play"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Bathrooms were locked, frustrating. Great course, BEAUTIFUL property"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,I would appreciate it if they let me know the course aeration before we book.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,We were told when we checked in we probably wouldn’t get more than 14 holes in even though we had 4 hours from tee time to sunset. I questioned what their pace of play was and they said 4.5 hours and they didn’t care of fast we played. I understand the course is full but they had a ranger going around but he wasn’t enforcing pace. As we left we asked the group on 18 their tee time and they said 3 pm meaning it took them close to 5 hours.The course itself is great but could be ran better.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"I play this course everry summer when i go back to visit family. The layout is a gem, especially the front 9. The fact that this place is so cool and the patrons refuse to repair their pitch marks on the greens makes me furious. Pete Dye is probably rolling over in his grave. This is one of the coolest layouts in the entire area, so I fix at least 6 ball marks on each hole. Respect the game. Staff was super nice - from the pro shop to the starter. Ill play it every year, regardless, but just know the greens were marked up last week when we played - which hurt my heart."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,The course had generous fairways and were very well maintained . The hills and greens were also challenging. We would love to play it again
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Beautiful course on a breezy day. Greens were quick but true. The scenic views and peaceful sounds are truly magical.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Would be nice to have water to wash hands in regards to restrooms.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"It was wonderful! No wait times, no one pushing us. The bunkers were in much better shape today. Better than 2 weeks ago!"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"My buddy and I played on a windy/rainy day in late March. We felt lucky to have the course mostly to ourselves and we took advantage of a GolfNow deal. On arrival, my buddy was told he would have to pay $32 for an extra cart. We like to bring my buddies brother along with us when we golf. He has cerebral palsy and is disabled, so clearly will not be playing with us just riding. After some words back and forth with the gentlemen at the counter about how ridiculous $32 is just for cart use, he went to get a “manager” to lower the price. How about making it free like every other course does? We understand when it’s busy and the carts are needed, we are fine with paying extra. But clearly something else could’ve been done this time and it just shows where these guys heads are at and it’s not about people and them enjoying their time golfing."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"One of the most beautiful courses in Central Indiana. As always, Course was in great condition. Took my golf buddy out for his first time there, and he just absolutely loved it. Can't beat a round here in early November at 70° outside."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"We love the Fort course. It was a beautiful fall day. The falling leaves made it a bit more difficult to find our balls, but still wonderful. We played 18 holes in 4 hours!"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,The course was in good condition. Playing pace was terrible and had to wait almost at every tee. The staff member in the clubhouse was very arrogant.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,I love the fact that you are not in someone’s backyard- and what you see is what you get- no “trick” holes
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"It was a wonderful evening, but pretty busy and pace of play was slow"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,My favorite track in Indy. Course was in excellent condition. Greens were fast but receptive. I could play here everyday and not get bored.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Played with my husband and were paired with 2 other guys that were very nice and we had a great round of 18 holes. No waiting for people in front of us and no one pushing us from behind. The sand traps were wet and not raked was our only complaint.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Overall good course but in my opinion its overrated. Pace was great on a friday morning. The plethora of bunkers were in absolutely terrible shape. At some point everyone ends up in one and it really ruins your game to hit off concrete.This course has a great deal of restrictions on cart and feels like very few areas you can drive your cart and the cart signs are very far back from the green leading to slower play. No GPS on carts but they are fast carts.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"I have not been home in 10 years, but this course mad me glad I came home! I live in florida with flat level courses for the most part. this course was full of hills ravines and fun and challenging to play. Next time I'm in town definitely will play here again. Got to pickup the birdies I left on the course!!!"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"We had some friends that said it was in rough shape, but for us it was in great shape. Greens were fast but fair and the course was well manicured."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Course is in good shape and greens are fastEnjoyed the courseI am from Florida visiting Indianapolis and love to play this course again
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Great layout but sand traps were poorly maintained and mostly hard pan.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,We had a great time. We just had 2 of us and their were 3-somes in front of us that were a bit slow. It turned out it was the 3 some 2 in front of us that was so slow. The 3 some in front of us went around them at the end of the 1st 9 and we went around them at hole 16.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Unquestionably, The Fort is one of the top courses in the Indy area. A great layout that was in fantastic shape. The greens were excellent, large but with a lot of slope and extremely quick. Pete Dye did a redesign and you can tell as it was quite challenging to play."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"The course had a hole map at each tee box with a suggestion as to how to play it. Lots of tee choices and the fairways were nice and tight to play off. Some were quite wide and simple to hit, but others required accurate tee shots. Also there is no water in play, which I liked."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"One knock is that the pace of play dragged as we waited on every shot. One reason is that the course was PACKED, which probably speaks to the quality of the course. However, a secondary factor might be that the course is very difficult and precise shots need to be pulled off on a steady basis. The other thing that was a bit of a downer is that our cart was pretty beat up. The wind shield was broken and the cart looked scuffed and tired."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Go play The Fort as you won’t be disappointed!
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Great course and I would play again. Only complaint was that the staff came out on the course and rushed us as well as a couple of other players. We had a fouresome and it was cart path only, so it did play longer, but we thought our pace was good. It took us just under 5 hours to play 18. Longer than usual, but when it is cart path only it is going to take longer than usual. I had 11,000 steps in for the day! We did let a twosome play through as well as a threesome. Only thing we could figure was the threesome told us they were regulars/memebers and they complained because they wanted to play faster. Other than that, it was a great time and I would play it again."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Public facility that gets a lot of play, great layout, pace of play can be problematic because the course is difficult. Staff is excellent."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"The Fort is one of the top golf courses in central Indiana. Numerous tees to select from make it enjoyable for all levels of golfers. Challenging layout, generous fairways, consistent greens."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Course was in great shape. Carts need to be updated.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Perfect day, not too crowded, one of the best public courses in Indiana"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,The course is perfect for an early season round. Green roll true.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Great course and good condition - the only issue is the pace of play - its probably a little to difficult for some players.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Good layout. Would play again if gets a chance.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Back 9 greens are a bit slow but understandable due to early in the season.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Carts not allowed on the fairways, so makes it a bit long round."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Enjoyed!
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,We always like this course and come to play a few times every year!
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Loved the fairways, beautiful scenery and the hills are challenging. The greens left a bit to be desired, lots of damage from poorly repaired ball marks giving a bumpy roll on many holes."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,I love this course . It’s a tough first play because you can’t always see what is in front of you. It’s a beautiful course. Love the layout.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Despite the expensive rates, it’s a great course that’s worth the price. I personally can’t afford to play it regularly but I like to get out here at least once a year. Would highly recommend it!"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"By far my favorite course in Indiana. Extremely well maintained, challenging, and scenic. Highly recommend to anyone and everyone."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"One of my favorites, nothing but great things to say about it."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"This was my first round at The Fort as I am a recent citizen of Indiana - What is there left to say that legions of folks have posted? The course accommodates many levels of skill, and the tee boxes are appropriately positioned. The course is hilly and the brisk breezes make the course play a lot longer than most courses. The course rewards gambles and the dog legs are extreme on a few holes, and straighter is certainly better here! Beautiful views, picturesque even and the pace of play was pretty good considering the range of skill-levels encountered on my round. The greens were in good shape, but aeration has been recently done. I look forward to playing this course again soon!"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,This was a great round of golf for the money! The Fort was beautiful in the fall.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"For late October the course was in good shape. They had recently spiked the greens but had yet to put sand down on them to fill in those holes. So that made putting somewhat a challenge. The rest of the course was in great shape. The grounds crew were out using big blowers getting the leaves off the fairways and since this course is tree lined it would have been difficult finding your ball in the fairway with all the leaves. Pace of play got slow starting on hole 7 as the foursome in front of us was really taking their time. It was a nice October day but come on, move along at a steady pace. Other than that we enjoyed our day and had a great time. Will definitely return next season. The staff were very nice all around."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,We always treat ourselves to a round of golf at The Fort in the fall. Beautiful course even more spectacular in when the trees are in their fall color.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Conditions were very good. Greens were cored but not sanded. Ball still rolled pretty good although you're starting out of a dimple. Driving range closed for seasonbut I did read that on the website. Otherwise everything was great. Staff were all friendly, outgoing and helpful. Will definitely be playing here again."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Gorgeous views, beautiful property, great course. Plays slow and leaves are tough"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Leaves cleared well. Greens had just been aerated but still decent. Pace of play is always an issue. It’s the one issue from playing there more often.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Good course but a bunch of grumpy old men working at the front counter.. The grumpy old men need to loose up and be more nice to the customers. I have played there so many times and they are so rude & not customers friendly. Need to hire more young people to work there. Unfriendly staff needs to change.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Always love to play there and will play there again!
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Poor fairway conditions on several holes. Bunkers were trash. Not with tee rates they are charging
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Great course but the pro shop staff acted like I was bothering them by checking in for my round that was further enforced when I got to my cart and it had a print out of all the things to do and not do on the course. Only person who was actually friendly was the starter
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Not only is this a beautiful course, the speed of play is excellent and it is challenging.They do a fantastic job at keeping the pace of play at a perfect speed."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Greens goodFairways goodTees goodBunkers not so goodGreat layoutNo drink cartWas threesome, then us a 4 some, then anotherThreesome, told on 15 we where playing slow by ranger, in a very nice wayGot 1 hole behind threesome, threesome behind us called in to pro shop, 3 always plays faster then 4, we played from 3 different tees, 2 seniors, a lady, then a guy who played blues do to his ability and distance off tee"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Great Course, serene, Nice Layout, Greens roll Stree"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"The most serene, and best public course in Indianapolis. A great challenge with accessible tees for all playing levels. Will be back when I get the chance!!"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,What is needed is for fellow golfers to repair there divot mark's on the green's
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Such a good course but conditions of greens and bunkers are awful! No excuse for it.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Was in impeccable condition considering how wet the area has been. Staff was more than courteous and help since I was playing as a single, the placed me with a nice couple in town visiting from Kansas City I believe."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"The Fort use to be one of my favorites courses and would play a handful of time every year. Last year you could tell they were not doing as good of a job maintaining the course. I played twice this year and the course was in worse shape. Hard and horrible traps. Average condition on the remainder of the course. When you have to pay high green fees, you have too many other options that are better for the price. Covid is not an excuse for the condition. Haven’t seen too many other course in this poor of condition, even the city courses. I have spoken to other golfers who feel the same way. So sad for all the fans of the old course."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Absolutely beautiful course and layout. I’ve played here several times and I always have the same two “complaints” - greens could be in a lot better shape and the course could use a lot more yardage markers. They could go a step beyond and add GPS to the carts, but doubt if they will ever happen."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,A wonderful golf course like no other within hundreds of miles. This course is a true gem for Indianapolis. This course has multiple tee boxes to accommodate any skill level. And it also has many memorable or signature holes. The Fort being a part of the state parks system is a plus. You simply do not imagine that you are in a Metroplex city. Very enjoyable to play.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"It's been a great week of golf in the Indy area and The Fort did not disappoint. Buffer Park, Brickyard Crossing, and the CC of Indy were all stellar golf experiences and The Fort brought Indy golf to yet another level. Historic, scenic, BIG, lush, just a great venue and the conditions were fantastic, and for a price that would make most high falutin' tracks blush. Winding through the hill country of the old Army fort area, this gem was a real pleasure. We played the White Tees, and when we looked back, the 2 tees behind us looked they could offer all any golfer could handle. Each home was unique and memorable, with ample fairways on some, tight spots in others, not a boring hole to be found. My friend who lives in the area says it's his favorite local course and I can see why. The greens do suffer a little from ample play with a lot of unrepaired ball marks and some slight fungus damage here and ther, but not enough to detract from the experience. I'd be happy to play here again given the chance. If in the Indy area, don't miss this beaut, er, brute!"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,This is my favorite course I have played around Indy. The course can be incredibly challenging if you are not on your game but also provides plenty of opportunities for birdies. The greens roll very well and all of the grass in the fairway is perfect. Wouldn’t mind paying $75 to play here
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Was in town and wanted to play this course. Glad I had some locals who had played it before to let you know the best place to put your shot. Course was in great condition. Greens were soft and not to fast or slow. I would love to come back and play again
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Course is a real gem. Layout is superb, and conditions were top notch. If i could give value 10 stars I would because you won’t find any courses this good for $100 let alone $60. Anyone visiting Indianapolis should absolutely play it."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Excellent course fairways and greens were the very best I’ve played in many years
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"I have always enjoyed the course and try to play it several times a year. I have been disappointed this year. played it twice in June and July. and was disappointed in the condition. Many traps had a lack of sand, hard and or not raked. Other conditions of the course were OK but not up to the condition in the past. When the green fees are what they are, you expect more. One of the rounds, one of the employees played with us and I mentioned the condition. He agreed and said it was the lack of enough employees to take care of the course. If they can’t keep it up, they should reduce green fees. Hope they can do a better job in 2023, because I have always enjoyed the course in the past."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,The course layout is nice. It just gets old as to having to pay FULL price and use CPO as the course retains water.The Greens fee is mostly likely high to cut amount of over play. Pace of play is always slow also with CPO. 5 hours.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Very nice layout and in good shape for a public course. Very generous driving areas but for a couple of holes. No water to worry about.Very Large Greens.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Great conditions besides some bunkers look to be going “natural.” Fun course. Will return.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,The staff is awesome the pro is great for a solid lesson and help for your game.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"The Fort is a terrific course. And it is in great shape! This is one of my favorites, and it never disappoints."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Great course. Traps were in bad shape but I always say don’t hit iit in them
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,I think they are short staff
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Excellent layout. Big and brawny. Take what it gives you or you'll be in trouble. Excellent staff and practice facilities! I'll return whenever I visit the area.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Always a delight to play this course. Well maintained and always a challenge!
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"bunkers are being redone, rough was US Open thick and lush. More weedy than last visits . Tees and greens are in great shape. Still one of the best tracks in Indianapolis"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,The course was in great shape. Very challenging layout.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Even in early spring, the course is gorgeous. A very challenging course for a beginner gofler but don't let the difficulty dissuade you. As for greens fees, a little on the steep end for me, but we got a Golf Now deal that made it a great value for the day."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,The course lay way out is excellent condition on the course was less than expected
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Beautiful course but the staff and rangers are rude. Used to be a course for military but now public and still act like it's a private course. Play about 3 times a year but can be aggravating due to the staff.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Took five hours. Waited 15 minutes and couldn’t get refreshment prior to round.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"The staff is rude. From the pro who only allows foursomes…to the check in clerk who won’t let you speak without interrupting, to the starter who questions you tee time even after getting your receipt. It seems pretty clear threes people do NOT want you to play this course."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Then there is the course itself. It’s pretty scenery but that’s it. EVERY hole is a gimmick hole. For examples…the par 3 fourth hole has a false front green. The gentleman who run this course put the pin ON THE FALSE FRONT!! I had a 10 ft putt and hit a good putt. Should have ended up 6 to 8 inches from the hole…instead it rolled off the front of the green and 15 yards down the hill!! It’s stupid! And every hole has something to trick it up! This is by far the least fun golf course I have ever played.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,I will NEVER play this course again and tell all my friends not to. There are better places to play than this over-priced gimmick city course.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Had a great time golfing The Fort golf course today for the first time. The beautiful fall leaves and deer were a bonus to this hilly, well maintained golf course. If you hit them straight you can score well. If not, you have a lot of trees and ravines to find your ball in.Would love to play this course again sometime."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Been playing here for years. One of Indy’s best courses, so I’ll continue to play… but the staff has always been very unfriendly and condescending for no reason."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,The best course in the Indianapolis area. A gem! Green Aeration was the only negative. Rain showers at the end of the fron nine. Had to wait about 30 minutes for it to pass over.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"I have played the FORT occasionally since 1968.Through high school, college, post-grad years and prime career! Generous real estated, little housing distraction, rolling terrain unusual for Indiana golf,And re-designed 14 years now by Pete Dye, a saintAmong golf devotees!Fees have risen, yet the charm lingers over 50 yearsWith the warm hand-shake on #1 to the surrender on #18! Thanks for your loyal friendship!"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,This course is a great one. I live close but I would travel from the other side of town to play a course like this one. I enjoy the challenges that this course has for my amateur level of play. I play 3-4 times a month and i generally rotate around to different courses but this one’s always in my routine.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"One of the top courses in Indiana, great design by Pete Dye, course was in great shape! Only wish play was a bit quicker, always spend 4 1/2 to 5 1/2 hours to get in 18, even during week days. Would recommend to anyone to give this course a try."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"I played The Fort with two other friends on 09/02/21. Another cool Pete Dye designed course. This is a parkland golf course with some holes that need to be played strategically (#2 & #10). The first time I played it, was almost five years ago to the day. I’m very happy to say that the conditions are still in excellent shape. The greens rolled nice and smooth. The course was in excellent shape from tee to green. The rough was not too high where you could not find you ball. Overall, the course is very fair. The fairways are wide enough where you can be off line with your tee shot and still be in play. I read some previous reviews about the staff being rude and unprofessional, but I can honestly say on the day we were there, the staff was extremely nice and professional. I would definitely play there again, for a third time."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,This course is not for a beginner however it is a great challenge. Beautiful scenery on virtually every course.Part of a State Park with the same name. A great course with multiple tee boxes hovering you pliability for any age and skill level ( above beginner).
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Great course but the rangers are too old to do their job. You will be waiting to tee off with a group in the fairway and they tell you to pick up the pace. Course condition is always hit or miss and the club house staff are always rude.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"The Fort golf course is a beautiful course, with many scenic holes - it's literally picture-perfect. It's also a wonderful challenge, with blind t-shots, blind second shots, and some significant carries required. The course is in very good shape, the fairways and greens were well kept, though the bunkers could use some TLC; COVID-times being what they are, it's of little consequence, and did not significantly impact our round. The facilities are great, the staff very friendly and helpful; the Starter, Ivan, was very cordial and shared a lot of details to make our day a great one - and it was!"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Course was in great shape except for the greens. They were in rough shape. No consistency.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,This was my third time playing The Fort and I must say the conditions were not as good as I remember. The bunkers were very sub-par and the greens were surprisingly slower than what I expected. But for the most part the course played nice. Could have used a breeze to combat the sweltering hot conditions that made the day miserable. I couldn't wait for the round to be over. I did however birdie two of the final three holes and three putted #17 from 85 feet. So I left on some good vibes.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"$85 for 18 w cart, but with it. Played in 4 hr 10 min at a good pace. One green had aeration, but other than that course was great condition even with all the recent rain. Great Sunday morning round."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,The greens are inconsistent with speeds. They need to be cared for as well. Tons of ball marks and unrepaired areas. The bunkers also have no sand and need tons of work. Many were unraked. Tee boxes and fairways were for the most part level and nice. This course probably was very nice 5-10 years ago.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Excellent facility. Very friendly shop staff and competent course maintenance personnel. Only drawback is that the players leave behind too many unrepaired ball marks, unfilled divots and unraked bunkers."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,The Fort is one of the best lay outs in Indiana. I’ve played the Brickyard and some of Indiana’s best over the past year and can’t say any of them are a better layout then the FORT. After a severe storm went thru a couple days earlier the course was in really good shape the only issue was some of the greens have been punched on the back nine. I would guess in the next few weeks they will all be done. They rolled well besides that and held a shot better then any greens I have played this year. The course is well worth the green fee price. Really fun and challenging. I also played one of my best rounds of the year even par 72
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,If I went to a municipal I would expect to tempo of play . Not what you expect when you pay that sort of money for golf. Several groups 2 + holes behind and no rangers to speed them up.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,This course is considered one of the premium courses in Central Indiana. Haven't played in a few years. Bunkers have a top soil sand mix. Not a good combo. Rough extremely high and not a consistent height around the course. Lots of grass clippings in rough making it hard to locate your ball. Only good for slowing play. Greens were by far the slowest I've ever seen on that course. Hope they can do better to improve.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Course is always so fun to play. First time going out this year and it was disappointing to see the greens in this condition. The course is in beautiful shape and then you get to the greens, and its the golfers that are chewing up the greens. I dont mind fixing divot marks but poor player maintenance this Spring has now left the greens looking like a crater field."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"I've played the Fort many times. Best layout and best undulating fairways in the city. HOWEVER, I could tell the battery charge on my cart was giving out. (I was the only one in the cart and weigh roughly 180 lbs, if you're wondering.) By the time we teed off on the 18h I had to ask my golf party members to give me a push up the hill because my cart was not going to make it. They did so as well as got out and pushed!! I barely made it. So...tip to the staff to checkout the battery charge in the carts. Other than that, terrific golf experience as usual."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,It was cart only so that made our round a little slower. Some spots were very wet and a few sand traps were like cement... from the rain the past few days. Greens/ fairways in good shape. We will certainly be back.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Greens require some attention to bring back toHigh level conditions.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Tees and fairways in very Goog condition
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Traps were inconsistent just need mechanicalraking to loosen up compaction
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,I haven’t played your course for 3 years but it’s my favorite course! The staff at the front desk are great!! Hope I can play it this year because I enjoy it a lot.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"The course has only been open for a week or so, so I will give them a break. The greens were covered in small piles of sand which made it very difficult to putt. In a couple of weeks the course should be in excellent condition."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,This was the first time we have played at this course and we were very impressed. We will definitely be back.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Played while in from out of town. For $60 I’ve never played a nicer course. The layout is fun but not impossible, the scenery is amazing, remote and not lined with houses everywhere. Tee to green it was in excellent condition."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,It is a great course. It is very pretty. It is very challenging from the tips. The course was in great shape
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"The layout is nice and challenging however it does not look like they have repaid a divet in years. All Par 3s was just hitting off dirt. The Greens were bumpy as well. Seems like they use this course as a cash cow, high price and don’t put much back into it."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,It is exceptionally beautiful but difficult course. It’s very hilly. I think the only time my ball was on level ground was at the tees. It’s a bit pricey too but I’m glad I played it
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,You will NOT be disappointed with this historic track. Gorgeous piece of land! Pace of play was slow (5-hour round)
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"It can be expensive, but this is one of the best and most beautiful courses in Indy!"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"The course was great! One of my favorites I’ve ever played. Most of the staff was really nice, but we also felt rushed even though we checked in 40 min ahead of our tee time. I felt the urgency was unnecessary and could have been communicated a bit more graciously."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"All in all, can’t wait to go back!"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,You’re not going to find a course comparable to this in Indy. Great place.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Tough course in the wind . Greens, fairways, traps in good shape. Mix of elevated greens and multiple tee boxes. Fun, put it on your list!"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Tremendous layout. Challenging but score able.Anomalous hilly terrain. Deceptively challenging short holes.Sometimes a bit of a long slog.Great exercise for walkers.Historical layout by the army, last modified by pete Dye in 1995."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Made the reservation online. Manager was very rude when asking for my I.D. when I showed up. Since there was 3 in our group and a 4th joined, we asked for another cart. They charged us another $10. We got to the tee box and our 4th was a walker. When we asked for a refund, we were told only the manager could do it and he just left. We could return 3 days later and get it but this employee was very full of himself. Even though it’s my favorite course in Indy, it will be a long time before I return."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"This is an amazing course, i am coming to play more."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"What a fantastic course! Conditions were great, I had forgotten how much elevation change there was and all the teeth Pete Dye usually puts in his courses. Everyone there was also super nice in getting a single out for a twilight time. This is the place to play in Indy!"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"For as much as you pay to play this course they should have a snack bar open and a ranger or at least let you finish your round. They are always rude here. I've been playing for over 40 years and this place never gets anybetter with their service. Employees are so entitled. I love to play the course but I cringe from the time I get there to the time I get tee'd off on number one. Everything is always closed, snack bar, range...carts need to be an hour before sun down.... Whoever runs this takes a great golf course and ruins the experience."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Beautiful weather, course was in great shape. Greens were recently aerated. Still worth the money. Great place just min from Indy."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,I've probably played this course 75-100 times over the years and it is the true challenge of course management. With the exception of Mother Nature's whims it is always in good shape. Back in the pre-Dye days it was a ball eating monster.Play it because it's worth every penny.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Every time I go to this course I feel like I’ve done something wrong before I even tee off. The staff is very Condescending.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"great course, slow pace, they don’t have ant rangers that do anything"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,The Fort golf course located outside Indy is part of the Indiana State Park system.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Staff was extremely friendly. Golf course was in good condition with excellent green complexes.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"No inside dining due to covid, but a must play if your in the Indy area."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Love playing this course, but have never been told by staff that we couldn't finish the round. We were on 16 when some guy drives up on a cart and tells us that 17 is our last hole for the day. Mind you we teed off at 3:20 pm and there was plenty of light left to complete the round. I would think that staff would've said something to us at check-in, but nope. I had brought a guest and it was his first experience playing the course. Needless to say, it left a bad impression on him. I'm not happy with not being able to finish up with only two holes left and plenty of daylight available. Will think twice before booking tee time here again."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"The course is awesome and maintained in really great shape. A lot of terrain changes and shot shaping opportunities on this non-typical Indianapolis course. Their layout creates a lot of walking/backtracking from parking to clubhouse to cart drop off. Seems poorly thought out. And if you play afternoon/evening, don't plan on getting in 18. We played 13 holes in two hours, then ran into a logjam of 2-some after 2-some that forced us to quit. No ranger enforcing pace of play. And the snack stand closed before 6:pm with the attendant and starter still there, but the wouldn't sell us anything to drink or eat at the turn, citing they were closed. Offered us the water fountain inside by the bathroom. For the price you pay, they lack in customer experience."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,The course is beautiful and interesting to play. Challenging but fun if you shoot in the 90s
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"I have always considered The Fort one of my favorites around (Fishers).great layout, course in good condition with the exception of the bunkers which are not well kept at all (we dropped many out due to poor conditions). Beautiful day and I will come back, please groom the bunkers and leave rakes for those to rake up after shots.thanks"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Played with a threesome on a Sunday evening. Course added a single walker with us, no big deal. Course was obviously busy for the weekend, though we still got through the front nine in under 2 hours. Back nine was a different story. Waited nearly 5 minutes on every tee box for those in front of us. Somehow an extra group of two snuck in between us and the foursome a head, making wait time even longer. Course staff member then drove out to us as we were finishing the 18th hole and told us we were holding up play and to hurry it up. Number one, very uncalled for as we were literally 150 yards out on the last hole. Additionally, they clearly didn’t pay much attention to what was going on out on the course as we were stuck waiting the entire back nine. Unfortunate situation on what was otherwise a beautiful day on a very fun course."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"This is a most enjoyable course to play. Each hole has it’s own vista, and allow the player to focus on the hole in they are playing. Nice large greens putted a bit slower than I expected, but given the heat of this season, it is understandable to keep them alive and well. I particularly enjoyed that last two holes. Suitable to the eye, but difficult to par nonetheless. I could play this course every day and never tire of it!"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"The fort is a great course and I always enjoy rounds here, but the greens have been really beat up compared to other area courses at similar or even lower price points. There are always several putts per round that do not roll true. A lot of the greens are shaded which I think makes them more difficult to maintain. At this price point I hope they would be able find a way to firm up and dry out the greens."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,It was raining on the morning but even with a little rain this course was amazing.. The elevation changes were quite Un expected based on where it's located. It has a lot of history behind it and was a wonderful experience. It's a challenging course which makes it even better. I will play it again when I Co.e back to ithe area. I can say enough about the course and the people working ther. I even had some of the grounds people help find one of my balls. If you get the chance to ay here take it you won't regret it!
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Played here for the last 20 years and it never disappoints. 5 stars!!
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"My favorite Indianapolis course and in my top 3 in the state. Every hole is scenic and challenging. Many holes have major elevation changes with carries over picturesque valleys & ravines. I have played when the course was in immaculate condition however, during this visit, several days of heavy rains caused very wet conditions. The staff is extremely friendly and professional. The lunch out on the patio provided spectacular views of the course. The food was delicious with very reasonable prices. I do not live locally but this is a must play whenever I am in the area. A five star experience."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,I forget about this course. EverytimevI walk off I tell myself I should play it more. Great layout because of the trees and a couple rolling fairways. Rare for Indiana.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Course in great shape! Great challenge for me from the blue tees for a 12 handicapper. The course won today!
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"People in the Indianapolis area must feel spoiled rotten to have not one but two spectacular courses designed by one of golfs greatest course architects. Quality wise The Fort is every bit the equal of Brickyard Crossing, but it’s the stunning scenery (particularly on the front nine) that puts it slightly ahead in my book (in agreement with golf.com’s 2016 rankings). I waited four years to finally play The Fort. I won’t be waiting four years til the next time I play it."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Truly unlike anything else in the area- if you want a truly unique golf experience in Indiana, this is a must!!"
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Fort is in pretty good shape. Some greens are not in good shape but most good. sand was wet so tough to play out of for most part. long rough and tough..
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,I hadn't played this course in many years. It is in perfects shape. There are lots of hills so the course is challenging but also playable. I highly recommend it.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,Beautiful views. Very well laid out. Excellent condition. Will definitely be back.
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"First and foremost, I love playing The Fort. It has been one of my favorite courses in the Indianapolis area for years as the layout is fantastic. That said, my main pet peeve is slow golf and the pace of play during my previous round was horrid. It took nearly 5 hours and 15 minutes to play 18 holes. It was of no fault to the group in front of us, they had nowhere to go. Neither did the group in front of them and so on. I understand that Saturdays can get backed up and I do not expect to play a sub 4 hour round on a weekend. But for the amount of money it costs to play, you would think that pace would be significantly better than what I just played. I would expect this out of some of the cheaper courses around town, but not a course like The Fort."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,"Absolutely gorgeous course! Very challenging, but missed shots are findable and usually playable. The greens are fair but hard to read. Subtle breaks combined with speed. My only wish was that sprinkler heads would have yardage. Some were broken off and that led to delays or guesses. The condition of the course was amazing given the little amount of rain received here in Indianapolis."
The Fort Golf Resort,5797-the-fort-golf-resort,This course is phenomenal and always great challenge. Definitely a favorite course in the entire area.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Need another tee between White and White/Green. The total distance difference is over 600 yards.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Very nice, well maintained course. Unfortunately, we played the day after rain, so cart path only and wet bunkers. Staff was not very helpful; didn’t know about cart path rule before teeing off, no info on pin positions, where to get cart, etc. No beverage cart. I would expect better given the quality of the course, holiday weekend and the green fees charged. That said, I would definitely play again."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"This course is in great shape. The fairways and soft and the grass is uniform. The greens are true. I found the greens to be pretty level without many putts that moved. The biggest challenge is the sand traps. They are everywhere and strategically placed to be very challenging. My only criticism is that the traps were pretty wet, with some of them even having water in them. The sand is hard packed and not at all fluffy. The grass in the rough is pretty thick in places so its easy to lose a ball in it if you miss the fairway."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"I have nothing but positives, great course, with only one negative…gotta get some new range balls. Those things are 100 years old. If you’re gonna charge as much as you do, gotta have range balls that are a year or two old."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"The course was in good shape and it’s a good layout. I have two issues which prevented me from giving 5 stars. The first is they have a cart availability issue. You literally had to wait until your tee time when a group finishing on 18 gave you their cart. As an example this caused a problem later because the containers with sand to fill divots were completely empty due to a lack of time to refill them. I was told by my playing partner this has been an ongoing issue for the past couple of years. Second, they have nicely contoured traps but are in need of more sand. You shouldn’t be hitting out of a thin layer of sand (borderline dirt) in a green side bunker. This is a great course layout but for the money those are two issues that should be fixed."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,One of Indiana's top a little tracks nice variety of golf holes. Pro shop staff could have been more friendly
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"For the price my expectations were high. This place delivered. Beautiful bunkering, great variety of holes, and the boxes/fairways/greens were perfect. Lots of penalty areas and chest high grass if you hit some foul balls, so a challenging course for sure. Their regular green fees are a bit overpriced imo, but I’ll be back if I can get another hot deal."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Course was in nice shape for early April. Pace of play was average to low average. This course would benefit from a starter and perhaps a course range to help move pace of play along. Range balls included in the round is excellent, more courses should do that."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Rate was a great value for twilight early Spring golf. However the course isnt worth the full freight rate of $100-$130. Would recommend playing twilight or off peak or hot deals.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Also a couple of times I've played the bar and restaurant closed down at 5pm. This was even on the Fri and Sat of the Masters. This is a little rough if you tee off about 3p so bring your own snacks and get plenty of beer before your round if that is your thing just in case.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Prairie View worth every penny. Good course conditions and is challenging but fsir
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Whilst our game was very much at the end of the season we enjoyed the challenge and the course. It was cold and windy making the course more challenging, the greens had been done ready for winter so were not at their best but with subtle borrows still ran at a fair pace. The fairways and Tee boxes showed how much the course had been played but it did not detract from the overall experience. Would I come back. Without a doubt. As a golfer from the UK used to small greens and a parkland layout, this course gave both, The front 9 open but with its own hazards and the back 9 more wooded. Some stunning visually challenging holes made for a good round. Look forward to returning in the summer."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,I always love playing this course. Challenging design and always great conditions.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"A great course, beautiful golf holes, and immaculate care make this a must play in the Indy area. Finding this on a hot deal was even better!!!"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Prairie View is a beatuful golf course and well-maintained fairways with clean pathways.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Had an amazing round with a few friends and couldn’t wish for a better course for the price we payed. Would come back and can’t wait to! Henry at the course was also the best cart guy we ever met!
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Only negative was pace of play. No ranger. Back 9 was 3 hours. Painfull
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"We like Prairie View the best of all the North side courses. Really can't complain about anything, other than it was a tad slow."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Great course liked the back 9 better. Very good food and drinks
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"First time playing, and enjoyed a really fun Sunday afternoon round. Course was in great shape even though we had a severe thunderstorm the night before...drainage was pretty good. Cart path only was the only downside, but understandable after all the rain. Several short par 4 requiring a smart lay up or a risky drive if you hit over 270 from the whites. A couple short par 3s also. Bunkers were very protective everywhere and several holes had small challenging greens. 20 mph wind and gusts made it pretty challenging."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Overall, a really fun course that demands accuracy over power. Big Lug was a decent stop at the turn also with a delicious chicken salad sandwich and friendly service from the gentleman behind the bar. Can't wait to enjoy another round here soon."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,~10 groups of High schoolers going off the back/front as I make the turn ... no warning. It would have been nice to have been informed playing as a single.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,The course was very pretty and a good challenge that makes you select your tee shots more carefully than some others in the area.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,the greens were aerated which was rough for putting but it’s part of keeping the course in shape.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Tons of trees surrounding the course so finding my ball was challenging at times and I ended up taking a gallery drop and leaving my ball that was hit in the rough for someone else to find to keep up the pace of play.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Overall would recommend, especially if you get one of the afternoon tee times that are discounted!"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Great course greens were running a bit slower due to sand top dressing but overall the track was in great condition. Even saw deer on a few holes.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Course is in great conditions and is very nice. Can be difficult at times but also rewarding at times.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Was visiting foe work purpose
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Great course and staff highly recommended
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"You can't go wrong, great deal on this course"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"The course was in phenomenal condition, however the usual rate is quite high for the area and course though."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Awesome layout. was really good condition for having rained the day before and a little during the round. greens rolled true and fairways were perfect.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,I know that greens need to be aerated in the fall but these were the worst greens I’ve ever had to putt on. The pace of play was very slow at there were two groups stacked on each tee. For the price of this course they should have a better handle on that. Of course the layout of the course is great but they have some things to clean up.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Had an outstanding experience on this RTJ Jr., course. It is hard to make a challenging and fun track, but this place manages to do so. Plus, the track was in excellent condition."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"The green complexes were difficult, had lots of slope to them and even short putts were difficult. The fairways were lush and the tee boxes were well groomed."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,The first couple holes are pretty open but the layout starts to get closer to the trees as your round goes on. The last hole on each nine is quite difficult. The ninth hole has two lakes on it and your approach shot has to curl around a lake.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"The back nine has more trees close to the fairways. No. 18 is just a beast of a par 5. Your tee shot has to be a pretty big fade. For most hackers, it is almost impossible to reach in two due to a long forced carry, but the layup is also difficult. Then, your third has to carry a small creek in the front. Quite a challenging way to end the day!"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Maybe we lucked out with our tee time but the place was busy but not slow. I think the course is so challenging that maybe it scares off a lot of beginners. Just a lot of difficult shots but I had a blast playing it. After my round ended, I really wanted to go right back out and try it again! It is pretty expensive but well worth it."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"I don't play a lot of golf in the Midwest, but if this course is representative, I need to. Beautiful course that was in great condition. Quite a bit of rain the day before we played, but the course handled it well with the fairways remaining firm and the greens holding well. Will definitely be back next time I'm in town."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Paid $71 for a Saturday afternoon. Enjoyed the course . Gold tees . 9 handicap
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Had quite a bit of rain in previous 24hrs, course/greens were in great shape but majority of bunkers were mudholes. Very, very rare for this course."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Great and challenging golf course that is second to none in the area. It was very busy but the pace of play was still really good for a Saturday.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"great condition…. GPS is excellent, and speeds up play."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Beautiful course, immaculate greens. Through 18 holes in under 4 hours on a relatively busy week day. Big Lug Brewery beer/food menu in clubhouse is an excellent bonus!"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Strong layout some visually intimidating holes, fun green complexes, great staff and facility. Could play everyday."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Course was cart path only after heavy rain but course was in amazing shape
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,They had just plugged the greens the day before and the course was really wet. Not the best day-
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Forecaddie program for Evan’s scholars is awesome! Course is in great shape and they keep the pace of play even on a busy Sunday. Great track!
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,There is nothing bad to say about this course. Everything is top notch here. There course is in excellent condition. It always is but it was spectacular for this time of year. The off-season rate made it a good value. The regular rate is pricey but the course is worth it. If you get that chance to play here...Do it!!
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Booked a round online, NO mention of any course maintenance being done. Once we start our round we find that they are purging the water lines and many of the holes are not playable. Add to that the pro shop allows a 6-some of inconsiderate young golfers to jump ahead of several groups already on the course., causing a backup for the groups behind. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??? WHY ARE 6-SOMES EVEN ALLOWED ON A BUSY DAY? ....This is a nice layout but the staff here is lousy, not the first time we have run into issues with the pro shop staff. Done with this place!"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Course was designed with beautiful view on White River and amazing green. Well mainted cart path and fairway.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,the layout was very nice and the staff was very nice. we were paired with two gentlemen who played the course many times before and were very helpful. especially when the in-cart gps warned us about blind shots on a couple of holes. some very difficult holes as well as a couple pretty easy holes. I'd recommend this to all.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"I live in Indianapolis and have played at Prairie View several times. It never disappoints! Even late in the season, this course was in great shape. I feel extremely fortunate to live so close to such a fantastic course. My only complaint - unless you can find a deal through Golf Now, it's not a cheap place to play. But hey, you get what you pay for, right?"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Played PV for the 3rd time in 3 weeks and it keeps getting better! Fairways have dried out and the greens are rolling great! Super bargain at Fall rates - get out and enjoy!
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"A small pet peeve I have acquired from nicer courses is the lack of ball washes on courses. Maybe they don’t need to be on every hole. But to have none at all is a bit much. Fall time is considerably more prone to a muddy ball that would be in the mist of leaves. Being able to spot your ball from a well struck shot is nice. But the course was next to empty due to some very high winds in the 20s I think. Ball shaping was a must. I’m a new golfer, but can manage to do some really nice things throughout the course of a round. So for me, it was about exploring a quality course in less than ideal conditions. I try to push myself through personal challenges. And today was not easy."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Played the course after a previous day of rain. The course drains very well, particularly the bunkers. Greens were a little hard to read but rolled very well for late October. I would highly recommend this course for late season play!"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Some very good deals in the clubhouse for end of season - golf shoes, clothes, etc."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"This was my first time playing the course. Played after a night of cold rain, the course drained very well. I played this round with a member and he kept talking about how slow it was, which tells you how fast it is in the summer months."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Great course, wonderful design. Highly recommend."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,I had heard about this course from a number of friends but never had the opportunity to play it.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,What a mistake in not finding this course before!
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"For late October (and 2"" of rain the previous 2 days) the course was in great shape; fairways were manicured, traps were in good shape and the greens rolled very well. I definitely recommend playing the appropriate tees based on your handicap and age - this course can bite you if you don't!"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Staff was friendly when we checked in, and everybody was practice in social distancing. Course we are in excellent shape and enjoyed the entire round. If you get the chance to play this course I would definitely put it on as one to play."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Excellent condition despite being cart path only due to heavy overnight rains. The staff was friendly & courteous. Beautiful layout with a good combination of links & parkland style holes. Greens rolled true. Strategically placed bunkers and hazards provided ample challenge on stray shots. An overall pleasurable experience. A must play when in the Indianapolis area.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Pace of play was pretty good.. I don’t know, if players know what those black boxes on the cart are for. There are not for drinks, but to use the sand and seed to refill divots. There wereof many divots not filled in out there. Also, I fixed 5-10 ball marks on every green. There were some black splotches on the greens that didn’t effect play , but looked a bit ugly. It’s a good golf experience and can get better , if the golfing public would fill in divots and fix ball marks."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Nice layout in good condition. The Pro is arrogant and does not know how to treat customers. Will not be back, too many other places to play where our patronage is appreciated."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"This was my first time at Prairie View and I really enjoyed the challenge from the black tees. The greens roll true, and it is clear the maintenance staff has pride in what they do. I was lucky enough to be paired with 3 members so that helped for some course knowledge. If you are looking for a $100/round experience in Indiana that is worth it, this is one."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Course is great and staff is friendly. Pace of play was faster than I like and some of the other players behind us were rude, hitting into us on almost every hole. We felt very rushed."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Great course. Very good condition. Good value. Will play again for sure.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"I booked my round through this app for 18 and a cart and unfortunately, Prairie View isn’t allowing carts out and hasn’t been for a month. They have notified Golfnow that they are not allowing carts but Golfnow continues to sell tee-times including a cart. Course was great and you should just book your round directly through their website. Don’t use this app as they take no responsibility for what they sell."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,The course was great. The range could have been better. Not a lot of grass. Overall good experience.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"PV is a nice layout. Thankfully, I paid the twilight rate ($55 instead of $90).The course would be helped by removing some trees near greens and tees that just don't get enough sunlight for decent grass growth and are in extremely poor condition.The clubhouse amenities are good, similar to a country club.Overall nice course, just not worth the greens fee for the condition it's in."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Played evening of busy weekend. Course still in excellent condition.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Course was in very good shape despite the wet weather...everything from tee to green.While some courses in the area have stopped using pins and cups, Prairie View is using PVC pipe that is raised a good 8” above the cup and they are color-coded blue, white, or red. That’s the best way to do it given the circumstances."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"I love this course and have played it may times. However they should not join with Golfnow and offer tee times, let the site take my $ and then be closed. Not happy"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"greens very bumpy, called club the day before they said course was prefect ""NOT"""
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"First time playing this course, will definitely be back! A top course in the state. Course layout is phenomenal, same goes for how the golf course is manicured."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Like the title says, that $40 around, this is the best golf course in the city for that price. I will be looking to become a member at this course"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"My father and I were in the greater Indianapolis area for a father-son weekend and after researching the best course options landed on Prairie View. Based on the course marketing and other reviews, our expectation were set high. While the course was above average in most aspects and weather was perfect, we both left questioning the investment in these 18 holes. At $90 per person, the course conditions left much to be desired. A dry summer may contribute to dry fairways and greens, but $90 a round should be more than enough to ensure conditions are at least adequate which was not the case. The fairway and green conditions were indicative of an average (at best) golf course. Additionally, on a less-than-busy Saturday morning we were forced to be paired with two others for our tee time, despite having no one on the course other than the very next group behind us. This took away greatly from the father-son aspect of our trip. Overall, we enjoyed our experience but I would not recommend playing Prairie View for more than $50-60 per round. Similar courses in our home area are priced significantly more reasonably and I am confident better value options exist in the Indianapolis area (e.g. other patrons of the course recommended we go to Purgatory the next day). BOTTOM LINE: Prairie View lends a great experience, but the price tag is unnecessarily high for what you get."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Great course but traps need work.But you waited 2 1/2 months to ask for my review so I can’t help you with details. 2 1/2 months. Seriously?
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Layout is challenging, greens were rolling, and beer was delicious. What more could you ask for?"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"The course was in great condition, greens weren’t extremely fast but fast enough and were very receptive to approach shots. Tees and fairways were in great condition and the layout was challenging. Normally I don’t spend this much but weekend morning round, and I don’t feel like I was cheated. I would come back for sure. (Handicap: 9.5)"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Prairie view was in great condition and it’s an excellent layout. If you hit your spots, reguardless of what tee you play from you will be rewarded. There are several intimidating approaches but missing correctly will result in a good score. Front 9 took 1:40 with a foursome. Back took. 2:40. The hold up was at least three groups in front of mine."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Great golf course and very challenging. The course is in amazing condition considering all the rain there has been recently. Will definitely play again.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Fairways and greens were in excellent shape! Staff was welcoming and 1st class as always. It Seemed like the first cut of rough hadn’t been mowed in a few days. Myself and several others I came across lost several balls just feet off the fairway.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Great course, very good condition. However, the sand traps were essentially packed as if it had just rained. The surfaces were either very hard or slightly soft. It was almost impossible to determine how to stroke the ball out of the sand. I realize it had rained on Sunday night, but no effort had been made to rake the sand and stir it up enough to be at least consistent. Other than that, great course, challenging layout and the conditions were perfect."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Obviously its early so a conditions review isn't the greatest. In two or three weeks the greens will be perfect like always but they're still recovering from being punched. so very slow and bumpy. other that that it was nice to get out and the course is great.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"It was a cold and windy fall day, but this course played great. Nice setup with fair challenges. Course was in great shape considering it is the middle of October. Will definitely be back next summer."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Oh and yeah, the price was hard to beat! (~$37)"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Great shape, great layout and can’t wait to play it again."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,The Greens were shaggy and slow.Ball marks all over them. Pace of play was terrible.No Ranger on the course. Will not play this course again.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Excellent course even with rain the last 3-4 days. My first time here and will definitely be back. A challenging layout and very enjoyable
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,It’s early spring so in 2-3 weeks the greens will be perfect but they had airified in the past few weeks and that made putting no fun at all. Love the golf course and the staff is great. Will be back when greens are healed.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Pretty good overall condition for this time of the year however they could have mowed the greens and fairways. Other courses in the area have already mowed and the difference is striking. Great layout though and I will be back in the summer.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"This was our first time playing the course. Liked it very much. Great layout, interesting. Plan to play it again."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Started out chilly, so it took a couple of holes for this Florida transplant to get going, but I had a great time. The course will challenge you, and requires good shot placement, but will also reward you for good decisions (and vice-versa). 4th time on the course, and enjoy it more each time."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"This was my first time to play this course. I was so impressed! The greens, fairways, and tee boxes were immaculate. I don't have a single negative comment - only positive!!! One of the ""best for the money"" courses ever..."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Gorgeous place. Robert Trent Jones design does not disappoint. 2nd time out on this course and can’t wait to get back.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Although the tees and fairways were in good shape, the greens were horrendous. The greens had recently been aerated and sanded. Slow as molasses and a game of Pachinko bouncing off small pebbles, burned out spots and plugs put in to try to remedy poor quality of greens."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Guys we were paired with said course only offers tee times when course is in poor shape. This was a premium rate and deserved premium conditions. Disappointed.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"There was no beverage cart and one lady at bar at turn with line 6 deep. Just grabbed a glass of water and went on. Didn’t want to hold up play. At the end of the day, there were service people wiping off clubs for a tip. Should have deployed them in more needed service areas."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Pace of play was a little slow. Had to wait several times. Perhaps I should have turned around when the guy at the pro shop said it was busy.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,The weather was great! Course was in great condition! Staff friendly as always. I got to play with an assistant pro as there will be the IN PGA tournament beginning on 7/9. Incredible to see how easy a 73 looks...HA! Thank's Prairie View.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Prairie View is one of the top golf destinations in the Indianapolis area. The course is in great shape, the greens are fast and immaculately cares for. Staff is friendly and it felt like the cart girl pasted us on every other hole. I will be back."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Prairie View is a challenging layout that does give some chance to score if you pick the right tees. But it's not a bombs away course as several holes involve dialing back and hitting to a target with less than a driver. The course is in good shape, though there were a few patchy spots here and there, such as on the 17th green. It also has some of the best practice facilities around, and having Big Lug in the clubhouse is great for a mid and post-round meal. Try the poutine!"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"This place is absolutely unreal. It was extremely busy but didn’t inhibit a great round on an unbelievable course/layout. Staff treats the general public as well as they do their members; friendly, accommodating, proactive. A must-play whether you live in town or are visiting/passing through."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"This was my first time at Prairie View even though I have lived in the area for 30 years. Why have I never played it before? I must be an idiot. It is one of ( if not the) best courses in Central Indiana. My first comment to my buddy was on the practice green. I said this looks like astroturf. It was perfect. I could go on and on about course, but words are limited. The staff was extremely kind, and there were rangers on the course. Two more words.....PLAY IT !"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Great course, great facilities, great on-site team - all for a great price."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Need Marshall, 5 hour round is unacceptable. Miserable day."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"What a course! Had heard about this place for years, but finally got out here and what a surprise. Even though it was raining for most of the round ... this course will not disappoint! Great mix of links/woods, and challenges (sand, water, trees) abound without interfering with the game. Still plenty of open space for some fun! One of the top courses in Indianapolis for sure! Will definitely return!"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Staff was friendly and efficient.Service was exceptional. Course and weather conditions were excellent.Can’t wait to come back!
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Nice golf course - one of the nicest one in the area, highly recommended. The staff are awesome too"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"This course, for some reason, is so highly rated. Pretty average course that charges too much because people pay it."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Play this course on a GolfNow “hot deal” if you can.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,It’s a fun track with some challenging holes but it’s absolutely not a premier course.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,It was just shy of a year since the last time. Great shape then and great shape on 4/27/18
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,I got a great price on golfnow otherwise it's above my pay grade. The course was in excellent shape and the greens were fantastic! If you get a chance to play...don't hesitate to go!
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"I love this course. Nice layout with fantastic fairways and a fair amount of heather. The greens could be faster, but I imagine they are already too difficult for the majority of players."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"There are a number of different tee boxes to make the course enjoyable for anyone. If you have time, I recommend making a day out of it. The practice facility is nice and grabbing lunch or dinner afterwards will be worth it as well!"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"I was looking forward to playing to finally playing this course after being one of the top ten in the state according to Golf Digest. I will start out by saying that the course layout is one of the best, if not the best, in the state! If you play the correct tees, it is a very fair golf course. However, the course maintenance seemed to be lacking from what it should be. All of the bunkers that I played out of were rock hard. Even after raking the bunker, it was hard to find that nice fluffy sand. The par 3 tee boxes were extremely torn up. It was hard to find a spot where you weren't standing in a divot hitting your ball. I also felt that it was odd that they aerated the greens already. I have nothing against aerating the greens at all. I completely understand that it has to be done to keep them nice, but normally that's not done for another month at least. The greens also looked like they were starving for water. It just didn't seem like the greens were healthy. The fairways and rough were in great condition. The fairways were fast and the rough was very manageable as long as you knew what you were doing."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"The driving range was just ok for me. There were plenty of targets to hit, but I had to wait about 20 minutes just to get a small bucket of balls to warm up. There was no one in the academy for me to pay for the bucket. I had to wait until the person retrieving the balls from the range came in to purchase one."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Overall, I would say that the course is trying to push as many people out on the course as possible to get their premium payment instead of holding off a few rounds to perform the much needed maintenance and up keep on the high traffic areas. It was a shame to see the course in that shape since there's such great potential of what that course could be with the layout it has."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"The course is easily one of the best in the state in terms of layout and conditions. Starting from the range and practice area, and going through the course it's easy to see how it gets and deserves its reputation. The course is tough, but fair. Keep it in play, and play from the correct tees, and you can post a score here. Spray it and pay with tall grass and water ready to catch the ball."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"The only negative was the pace of play. This started from the first tee, when we wound up in the middle of a bunch of twosomes stacked together behind some foursomes. No one paired us up at the outset, or too initiative to pair up on the course (ranger just waved and drove on), so it turned into a 2-3 deep on every tee grind, especially around the turn."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"But, overall I wouldn't hesitate to go back. It's in great shape and a lot of fun. It's one of the top 3-5 courses around Indianapolis, easily. Deals can be found online, but you have to look for them in not so usual places."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Played on a late Tuesday afternoon, and pretty much had the course to myself. The overall conditions were excellent given all the rain the area had received. Greens rolled true. To me is a little pricy, but is worth the play."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"I love this place. I was sad to see them drop off of the golf now site, but I get it. It's a bit pricy but it is so nice."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"I have played all the top public courses in the Indy area to include Brickyard and the Fort and this is my favorite. The facilities are great and the staff are very friendly. The course is very well maintained...we had 30 minutes or so of showers midway through the round and they had gators with blowers drying the fairways right after. The carts are GPS equipped so there was never a question on yardage. Now the course...I love this RTJ course. Challenging, diverse holes (I used driver, 3W, 5W, 3H, 4I, 5I, 7I, 9I, and PW on tee shots)...they were challenging yet rewarding and open enough to feel you didn't have to be absolutely perfect. Plus there are multiple tees for all skill levels. There were prairie holes and several that went into the woods and were lined with trees...strategic bunkering, forced carries, great holes carved around the ponds...you can tell this course was meticulously thought out. The greens were fast, true and in prime condition as were the the fairways and bunkering (which is extensive). My brother, who I was visiting, bought a groupon so we had a very good deal...but I would gladly play $80-$100 to play it. If you can play a couple courses in Indiana, play the French Lick courses then play this one!"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"This course has everything you could ask for, with the exception of a lot of un-repaired ball marks on the greens. I will definitely play it again, hopefully when there isn't a 20 mph wind."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"The design characteristic of protecting greens using depth perception is a favorite. And it is well used on this course. Unfortunately, the practice range, most tee boxes, and greens seem to be neglected. They are not at the quality level to be expected at this facility."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,This course is very tough but rewarding. Their are multiple tee boxes for any type of player.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Great course to play late in year-on hot deals. Too expensive for me at $75 during the week.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,This course is fantastic in the summertime and one of the most difficult in central IN. But it was in fine shape for Nov 11th.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"On arrival there was mix up on tee time, the gentleman behind the counter could not of been any nicer, even though it was 110% my fault he went out of his way to fix problem. now to the course.pros: fair lay out to play good mix of holesgreens super fast but consistentfair ways good shapevery good GPS ,nice cartscons: bunkers could use some work"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,I had a wonderful experience from the moment i went into the clubhouse till the attendant unloaded my clubs. The course itself was challenging but not over daunting. Pace of play was what I made it so cant complain about that. Perfect day of golf at a perfect place.highly recommend
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"I like the course but greens are still healing up from aeration. Greens are bumpy,sandy and a little slow due to aeration. All other features are great."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Course was great, but greens had recently been aerated and after a long weekend of rain, fairway grass had gotten pretty long (understandably, as it was probably too wet to mow). Seemed like it would have been pristine on most days, but conditions were just okay this time."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,The greens had been recently aerated and top dressed. Got a $5 reduction because of this.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Beautiful and challenging course. Has everything for lower handicapped golfers. Great value with the golf now discount.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,EXCELLENT condition!! Fantastic layout!! No houses on course.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"I was lucky enough to find this special on GolfNow and decided I would play this track I have heard so much about. It was terrific! The course was in great shape & had a little bit of everything. Links style to start & wooded at some points. I like courses that make you think and manage them..this track did that. It wasn't the typical, ""Pull out the driver"" on every hole. I will play again soon. Staff was polite & attentive. A good day!"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,This is a must play if you love the game. The $90 is steep plays like The Fort but not as hilly. Awesome greens
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Great layout and well maintained. Definitely recommend to anyone living in or visiting the area
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Prairie View is a great course. a good challenge when you are feeling like your game is ready to be tested. it is difficult but fair. for me it is too costly unless I find a deal on this site which is not hard to do. as a result I play there often.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,The course was in great condition with opportunity to use all of the clubs in your bag. The Staff is friendly and helpful from the moment you drive up to unload your clubs. This should be a course played here in Indiana as often as one has the opportunity.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"I've played this course a few other times and my opinion remains the same, this course is fun to play. The course layout is awesome and other than a few tee boxes it's in fantastic shape. Definatelty looking forward to my next visit!"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Be careful of the creek on the first hole, the second hole is about placement not lenght as the trees guard both edges, then you must favor the right side on the next hole or prepare to use a shot to get back in position. After that enjoy a scenic golf course with large greens that were in excellent shape the day I played, true."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,I will play there again as I forgot how much I like this course.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Great coarse to play. If you place your tee shots well you feel like a million bucks. Not difficult to navigate. Fun greens. Top 7 Indiana golf @ it's best.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Unique and challenging course with lots of heather.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,This course is always great to play. It is kept in near perfect condition. The fairways are beautiful and the greens undulate and are faster than expected. This is still my favorite course in Indy and would recommend it to anybody. It can be a bit pricey but if you are using GolfNow you should be able to find a great deal.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Nice Coarse but difficult. If you don't like sand...youre bound to end up in it....
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"This course is mostly open with tall grass and a few tree lined holes. The conditions were very good and well maintained from tee to green, although the greens seemed a little hard and slightly slower than expected. Most greens were well contoured and some were quite large. In most cases you could spray the ball a little without to many problems, however, a little local knowledge off the tee is helpful to negotiate a few traps and doglegs (#1, 5, 8, 10, 11, & 16)."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"The best holes were #9 & 12. 9 is a moderate to long par 4 with plenty of room off the tee and a severely sloped green contoured around a large pond. 12 is a double dogleg Par 5, around two lakes, which can be reached in two with a good drive and long second shot over water. Holes #10 & 11 are both short dogleg Par 4's that aren't bad, but it would be better if they weren't back to back. A driver can be too much on both."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,The gentleman in the Pro Shop was not the friendliest individual and was basically indifferent upon arrival. The other staff members both outside and at bar/concession area were friendly and helpful.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Full disclosure, I'm not a links-style guy at all. But I jumped on a hot deal b/c of user reviews, savings, etc. It's a solid course (links/otherwise) but I was disappointed how chewed-up and unrepaired the greens were- also inconsistently cut from hole to hole (some furry, some fast). Also, it's open to a fault in my opinion- I don't like being able to see a dozen other holes from a given fairway, but that's just me. The fescue is ridiculous- I'd much rather be able to actually find my ball on an errant drive and punch out from behind a tree, rather than tread through heather and get my legs eaten by bugs and cut by weeds. Overall I found the course very challenging, well-maintainted (w/ the exception of several greens), but boring, and long...kind of like this review."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Really liked layout and course was in really good shape-I learned late in round that course had been flooded in spring which made its current condition all the more remarkable.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,VERY impressed with the way the greens rolled-very true. Lots of bunkers but all appeared to be very well maintained.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Cart attendant very cordial. Would have liked to have spent more time on pro shop but pressed for time after round.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Overall, very good experience"
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Playing Prairie View Golf Club was a great experience. The course was challenging from the back tees but not overwhelming. Beautiful design of a golf course and great use of the property.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"The golf course was in great shape. The fairways and greens were great. The course was challenging, but the GPS on the carts helped to determine the best shot off the tee and into the greens. Overall I would do this again once a month. Especially if they continue to do the ""hot deals."""
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,I enjoyed pLaying this course! It was challenging and in great shape.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Great value for the money. A nice blend of links / prairie and traditional course design that keeps your interest.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Prairie View is a unique opportunity to play a great layout designed by one of the premier golf course designers. Usually, this type of experience is limited to private courses, but Prairie View is available to everyone. The staff spends considerable energy in maintaining the course."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Pratice range needs work, not only the tee area but the target greens could use some improvement. Prices have always been on the high end, but course conditions (Bunkers in particular) are better than most. Biggest issue seems to be ball marks on the greens and unsanded divots in the fairways around the 100 yard markers. For the $90 normal green fee, in the Indy area, expectation is Country Club like conditions."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,This course is one the few gems within the Carmel area. All around enjoyment (if you're playing well) at this course. I've been there a handful of times and will keep coming back.
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,Course was in decent shape after the drought we had all summer. Some of the greens were bumpy. But it is an awesome course that is very tough. I really enjoyed it!
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"This is easily one of the top few courses in Indianapolis available to the public. The in-cart ""big screen"" GPS was a great amenity. The course is in immaculate shape with the exception of #14 (which is being re-seeded and a couple of trees being taken down to help the green). If you ever get a chance to play, it is a must play course simply due to the groundskeeping expertise."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"Great course, but bring your A game. Wayward shots can be excruciating."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,"I'm a member at Timbergate GC just south of Indy. There was an outing at our course so it gave us an opportunity to go to Carmel and play Prairie View. The course was in excellent condition and we felt pampered the entire time we were there. The staff works hard to keep up the pace of play, even when the course was full. It's still one of my favorite tracks in Indiana and I love playing there."
Prairie View Golf Club,516-prairie-view-golf-club,The twilight rates are incredible and a great value for the money.
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"It’s rare to see a 9 hole course with such a high rating - ok, you never see a 9 hole course rated this high. Buffer Park deserves it. Just a gem of a course tucked away in central Indianapolis. Regulation length, in fact can play pretty long from the tips. Course conditions were superb with delightful hole layouts. Just a pleasure to play. Oh, did I mention price? I think they charged me only $25 to walk 18. While there is no driving range, it is an excellent place to work on putting, with an ample practice green to get good work in. Greens in excellent shape. Definitely play if you get a chance. As good a golf value as you will find anywhere"
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,Buffer park has become on of my favorite courses in Indy to play. It is the perfect mix of challenging and gives the golfer the opportunity to score. The club house has some of the best staff I have experienced. Conditions were in top notch shape. The bunkers are nice and fluffy.
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"One of the better public courses in Indianapolis, to bad it’s only 9 holes. Course has several scenic holes, the par 3 over water is terrific. The finishing hole is great as well."
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"Buffer Park is about all you can ask from a 9 hole track. Solid layout with water in play throughout, narrow fairways, sand, and other problems should you spray. Fairways are fairly narrow but well kept as are the tee boxes. Rough was in good shape too, and was at a good length for a mix of jumper and clunker shots coming out of them. A couple greens had some damage spots, and they all ran noticeably slower than the putting green but were smooth."
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"Friendly staff in the club house, which is a nice size but pretty bare bones inside. Easily the second best course I've played inside I-465 (Indianapolis - Brickyard is in its own league and the city munis are a significant step down from this). Worth the drive from downtown or the area if you're local or on your way to the airport as a getaway round."
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,Glad to see this diamond in the rough is still here. It's a great little course. Changing from whites to blues really changes how this course plays. Absolutely love it. Glad they are still here!
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"Buffer Park seems like a well-kept secret in the Indy golf community. It's a well-maintained, beautiful course that's worth the price to play every time."
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"Absolutely love this course. Can play 9 holes in 1:30 so it perfect for a quick game after work. Switching between the Blue and White tees changes a lot of how some of the obstacles come into play. Very well kept, slight issues with the irrigation system so some of the fairways are always wet. The staff is wonderful. I play here at least once a week."
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,I played here on oct 9th.The staff are very friendly and helpful and the condition of the course was spectacular! I would definitely recommend this course to friends and family and I will definitely be playing here again soon!
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,This is a great 9 hole course. Have played it several times now and enjoy it each time I play it. The course is in great condition and is priced right as well. The staff is friendly and makes you feel like a valued customer. Definitely worth playing and I highly recommend this course.
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,Course in great shape like very much playing this place
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"Buffer Park is a 9 hole course essentially hidden on the south west side of Indianapolis just inside the 465 loop. It is the best 9 hole course I have ever played, and rumor has it to be one of the best 9 hole courses in the country. The layout is a perfect mix of challenging and good opportunities to make birdie. I liked all 9 of the holes, but the sixth hole is a gorgeous par 3. There was some water damage around the course and the greens were a bit pocked up or this would be a five star course. I will be back sooner than later!"
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"Played Friday afternoon - it was a little hot, but ample sunshine and a little breezy."
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"This course is almost always in perfect shape; they spend their money wisely and it's a reliable way to part with your money. Tees, fairways, rough are all fully grassed. Bunkers were in great shape, greens were solid as well. There are a few strategic bunkers to get you thinking off the tee. I like the routing, the site was formerly landfill and they use some elevation changes to keep it interesting. I think they blend challenges with some easier holes well."
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"The par 5 opener sports a massive fairway, which helps you ease into your round. Most of the landing areas are pretty generous: the par 4 fourth is a short, gettable hole so fire away. The fifth can be a tester off the tee, but don't let the tee box point you in the wrong direction. No matter which tees you're playing, I think you should go up the back tees on the par 3 sixth; from there the holes is one of the best short holes in the Indy area. The last two home holes are a great tests; have fun getting your approach to the back of nine's green when the flag is there. Par on this one feels great."
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"For the money, you can't get much better. The consistency in conditions makes this a great and reliable way to spend time on the course, usually under 2 hours."
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,First time at this course ever and the attendant at the front desk allowed me to use 4 irons 3 hybrids and a wedge and used balls without question. Carts are best around. REALLY BUSY on a Saturday and still was not pushed or pushing at all!!! The course is the best 9 hole course I have ever played!! it's hard enough to challenge a low/mid handicap player but to allow a high handicap enjoy there day. WIDE FAIRWAYS 2nd/3rd cuts are excellent greens are perfect and smooth. And the view is something else. WILL be my weekly course for a while. Only issue I had was there wasn't many commodities they have every ball and nice used balls but as of second hand clubs for sale as most courses have wasn't too many and they didn't have the price as the pro wasn't there!
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,Great 9hole gem where you would not expect a golf course to be. Great staff. Great value. Beautiful challenging course. Highly recommend.
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"I have lived in indy for 10 years and I had never heard of this course. I played earlier today and I was amazed. The course is a nice setup and it is in fantastic shape. I have played the majority of the top tier courses in the region this summer and this course is in better shape than all of them. It's a 9 hole course, but if it were 18, it would be in the GCI, Trophy, Fort class. I was very impressed and it was a great deal for the $"
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,BP is always green and lush. I've played most of the courses in central Indiana and BP is one of the most enjoyable. It's not a difficult course but challenging enough to be interesting. People are always pleasantly surprised the first time they play this course. Not a country club setting but a very well maintained course.
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"This golf course is always in pristine condition. Plush, challenging, great layout. highly RECOMMEDNDED. Best nine hole course you will play. Compares to the upper end 18 hole courses like Prairie View, Purgatory etc.."
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,This course is a great 9 hole course. Great looking golf holes. Well kept greens and fairways. Highly recommend.
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"THIS COURSE WAS A VERY NICE SURPRISE. VERY CLEAN, AND A FUN COURSE TO PLAY. IMPRESSIVE."
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"I recently was visiting my neice for the weekend and wanted to play a quick 9 holes of golf. I found this course so enjoyable I had to replay it. The course layout is quite nice. Relatively generous fareways but there is water that can come into play on several holes. This is not a cow pasture course (back and forth...side to side holes) but has a gentle rolling series of holes well laid out. Also, no condos or homes on the course and surrounded by trees. I have been playing golf for 25+ yrs and I would recommend it to anyone at any level of play."
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,Rob
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"Been here several times, always have had excellent experiences, a amazing gentlemen by the name of Chuck runs counter during afternoon hours, i recently went last week evening ours and another older gent' ran the counter. He was very short, but no need to chat I got key and on my way. IT was raining, literally nobody on the course, so I was taking my time. He approached me after a hour of my play, and I first asked, How you doing sir!? He then said' not very good, you are taking too long to play, I then apologized and stated how I was only taking more time for there is nobody else on the course, He then went on to tell me how I dont know how to play the game of golf, (I shoot par, on a regular basis.) and I am wasting the courses money, and his personal money as well. I felt so uncomfortable I just wanted to grab my ball and leave right then, but I finished. The most rude encounter I have almost ever had for paying a business my money and feeling this way. Very disappointing in this disgruntled employee. I literally cannot believe that this happend, I am still very baffled by this a week later, and by no means complaining, i very much hope they notice this and correct the issue for the course is very nice, and the other employees running it are kind. Thank you."
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,I was pleasantly surprised at how well this course is maintained. Beautiful greens and fairways. Pretty friendly layout. Nice course.
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"if u get a chance to play buffer park u will not regret it, very nice and maintained"
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"Solid. This is surely one of the better 9 hole courses you are going to find. Me being a golfer on a budget though I never really play there. I was able to find a time on GN saving well over 50 percent for the 9 holes. Must have been a slow time becausone was really out there. Course is a challenge for the amatuer and in great shape. I wasn't a fan of the sandy greens though, your ball barely makes a divot and some putts that appear fast actually slow down. I would play again, but only at a large discounted price."
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,accuracy is a must at this nine hole layoutwell conditioned while allowing you to hit a variety of shots either in the air or on the ground
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"This is the place for you. I have played this course at least a dozen times and find it just that, a championship 9 hole course. Every hole is beautiful with it's own special challenges, perhaps none more so than the par 3 6th. It plays about 175 from the elevated back tees across a water hazard that is a filled in quarry. The green is above rocks at the quarry's edge and below a tall berm that separates the course from active quarries. Don't think you are going to just another ""cow pasture"" 9 hole course. This place is the real deal."
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,I played this course twice this week. It's in excellent shape. Greens roll well and are moderate in speed. Staff is very friendly and helpful.
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"Great 9 hole course. Challenging for all levels. Rough is tall, thick so stay out. But it is really a beautiful hidden gem"
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"I played early afternoon. It rained the night before and in the morning. The course was in great condition. There was not much standing water on the course. Fairways and greens rolled great.Driving the ball you have to be accurate, but the course is not tricked up just because it's nine holes. If you play by yourself, like I did, you can play nine in about an hour."
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,course was in greaat shape it played will greens were fast but also in great shape fareways were well maintain had not play here in a long time but realy this round.
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,The staff at this course is very friendly and helpful. The course is very well maintained and very enjoyable to play.
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,Greens are just coming in after an unusually cold Spring and were slow-putting and a bit bumpy. Recent heavy rains have the fairways green and lush. Another two weeks or so of warm weather will turn the course into what I've come to expect.
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"I always enjoy playing Buffer, and look forward to playing it again soon."
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"I know that it's early in the golf season and last summer was dry and hot. That's why the putting surface has some bad spots. But it looks like it's growing in and will be ready to go soon.I would recommend this course to anyone wanting a challanging game of golf. The course has its own amen corner holes 5 par 4, 6 par 3, 7 par 5 water, sand, trees what a challange. You will have to see it to believe it. Fun Fun Fun!!!!"
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"First time I''ve been to Buffer Park, and as soon as I got there I felt welcomed.. it was a slow day so only a couple people on the course, so playing it was fairly quick. Very beautiful course for it only being open a couple weeks..."
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"I always enjoy my round here, fun yet challenging. The rough seemed a little long, but tee boxes, fairways, and greens in great shape. My only negative comment would be that our sand containers on our cart were empty, so we were unable to repair a couple of divots."
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,"Three tee locations for all skill levels, tee boxes, fairways and greens are in very good shape. The rough was medium length and the greens are fairly large with some undulation to them, at the time they were sand dressed. The course has a fair amount of fairway and green side bunkers with water on 3,5,6,7 and 9."
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,This is the BEST 9 hole course. The staff are really friendly and personal. The course is great for all handicap players. We play this course 4-5 times a month. I recomend any skill player to play here.
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,Golfnow offers and great price at excellant golf coarse. Since playing my first round there I have been a repeat customer. And I tell all of my golf buddies about Buffer Park and Golfnow.
Buffer Park Golf Course,28994-buffer-park-golf-course,This course is well maintained. The fairways are in great shape and the ball rolls straight and smooth on the greens. This is a challenging course with wooded areas or tall grasses along many fairways and water that can come into play on all but a few holes.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"I always like to play there, link and traditional setup all in one!"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,I loved the course as it is like playing two different courses between the front 9 links and back 9 mature trees and challenging holes. Best course I played in Indiana.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"I've played Bearslide ever since it opened and I've never seen the golf course in better shape. Tees, fairways, and greens were pristine. The 1st cut rough was challenging but, playable. Hats off to the the GC Superintendent and grounds crew for excellent quality of workmanship!"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Beautiful course in great condition! Greens are smaller than I’m used to but nice and fast. Will definitely play here again as it is one of the better courses in the area.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,$61 for a “deal” at 2:12??? $102 for regular greens fees?? No sir. Won’t be back.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Course is in great shape. Front 9 and back 9 are different courses
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Good and moderately challenging public course. Conditions were ideal and the course was in very good shape. You cant just wing it around the course. Being tactical helps
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Gorgeous property. Like a nature preserve! Course layout is dynamite. It’s expensive for a course with no GPS on cart, no cart girl and no water available on course. Tough on hot days."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,The course has always been a great course. Great condition. They used to have a good senior rate. Not anymore. $62 senior rate and no water on course and no beverage cart. I probably will not return because of the cost. There are several comparable courses in the area that have senior rates around $40.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"I coach golf and index between 5-10, depending on practice / injuries.This is probably my fav now in/near Hamilton Cty.My only complaint is the course is always over-watered and plays soft from tee to green. Greens are just right and probably best in town.Based on all factors the best upscale plays on Northside of Indy:T1 BearslideT1 Trophy Club3. PurgatoryGC4. Prairie View5. The FortOverrated: The Fort & Prairie ViewUnderrated: Fox PrairieGrossly overpriced: BrickyardModerately overpriced: Prairie View & The Fort & Plum CreekMost of the Hugh end public options should be kept and maintained “Firm & Fast”, but sadly few to none are.You want a SLOW round go to the Fort, an overpriced round go to Brickyard, The most fun round - Trophy ClubSadly, “GROW THE GAME” has ruined it ….. now, it’s spring break at every course …..You want to wear beachware, grape smugglers, smediums …… go to the beach, NOT the courseYou want to listen to music go to a concert or use headphones - DO NOT assume those around you want to hear whatever your ADD ears desireIf your group is pacing any bit over 4 hours, let people play through. Keeping up with slow play in front of you means your play is slow and you are part of the problemThumbs up on Bearslide"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Bear slide is a bit of a schizophrenic spot w the front feeling like a pure links course and the back more like Michigan golf. Both sides are fun and fair although the back has some a few quirky holes for the first timer. Generally speaking, course was immaculate, especially for late Sept. Absolutely no complaints on that side. Greens fast, fairways in good shape etc. I’d play it again."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Another gem of a round. Course was great as usual!
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,This place never disappoints! Great course and great staff.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"I've always loved this course and try to play it whenever I'm in the area, but I was blown away with the condition of the course this most recent time I played. The greens were some of the best I've played in the Indy area all year. There are lots of sand traps and some don't seem easy to maintain, but they were all perfect. Fairways and rough were also in great shape. My buddies and I were so impressed I told them on the 17th tee that I'm going to have to leave them a review because the course was amazing. A must play whenever you're in the area!"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Awesome layout and challenging course with a lot of variety
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"In great shape, good layout, exceedingly friendly staff. You cant find anything on this level for this price in Los Angeles, I can assure you. Only reason I gave a 4 is because I'll play Sawgrass someday and I have to reserve a 5 for that. But, gimme great 4s like this for under $60 all day long and I'll never complain. I played all 9 Indianapolis courses that appear on every ranking for the city and this is in the Top 3-4, easily. Also, it's just far enough North of Indy to be really quiet out there. Just a joy of a round."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Challenging course, some blind shots. Worth the trip.Twosome played in under 3.5 hours"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,We’ve played Bear Slide before and enjoy it. This day course was in good shape and pace of play was good. Staff really makes you feel at home on the course.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"I enjoyed putting as most all of the greens putted true and were fast. The carts and cart paths get a ""D"" as they are in very bad shape. Trees need to be cut back and low maintenance was observable.I'll be back as I enjoy this course."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Golf carts are dated for this level of course. The pro shop staff seemed bothered we were there. No energy or smiles. Our cart died on hole 4.. the guys that came to replace it where great ! Still one of the best tracks in Indy area .
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Best course in the area hands down. Greens were in perfect shape. Loved the speed of the greens.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Good shape. Cart paths have had some needed strip patching. Bunkers had plenty of sand. Green we’re fair and reasonable.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,I came down from Michigan with my 16 year daughter for another event and decided to play here the day before.We loved the course and had a great day- Thanks!!!
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"I play dozens of courses in the area and Bear Slide is the best. Thanks to GOLFNOW I usually find a good rate but would pay regular fee for the pleasure.Two different nines challenge players to use all clubs, the conditions are incredible and the staff is top notch"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,They need a cart person on the course and bathrooms for women
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Really enjoyed playing Bear Slide. Great course and friendly staff.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"The course is challenging but fun to play. Lots of hills, slopes, water, trees and rough. The course was not maintained as well as I remember in the past but that's probably due to staffing and increase in supply/gas issues. The staff was very friendly and easy going. The carts are nearing their end of life and do not have GPS. But the environment is scenic with lots of wildlife. It was not very crowded and the tee time special made it very affordable."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,One of the best courses in Indiana! Absolutely love the pace of play and challenge of play. Try to play here at least 5 times a year and it never gets old!
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Loved the back nine. The day we went was cart path only play. Greens were perfect. Groundskeeper hole placement was well throughout.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Played on a 50 degree day. No one out there. Great course. Will play again. Golf now , I got it for 40 bucks."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Course layout is not the greatest. Very tiny greens. A few holes have bad landing zones off of the tee. You basically have to layup or you will be landing in rough because the fairways end.Amenities aren’t good at all compared to other courses in area.You drive in and there are course rating signs that seem outdated. They may need an updated review of what’s being advertised.Overall not worth the drive from city.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Cart path only but course was extremely playable. Course is worth the drive.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,The course is in great shape. Great practice areas and the pace on Friday was perfect. The greens are fast! This is a hard course
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Golf now for the win again. 35 bucks for a round. Def play again when another deal comes along.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Course is in great shape. Greens running fast. It's worth the drive for that price!
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"The green conditions are a 50/50 shot. This go around, greens were hard as a rock. Had multiple wedges from 100-145 yards out that would land short…bounce 6-7 feet in the air and roll 10-15 feet . A little frustrating."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Found a good deal on GolfNow. Paired up w some others. A couple really slow players a few groups ahead but not the end of the world. Course was pretty good for this time of year. Recently aerated but not too bad at all. Love the course and layout!
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Even though it was late November, the course was still in great condition. Fairways were plush, and the greens rolled well. This is one of my favorite courses in Indiana. It is challenging, but fun to play. I highly recommend Bear Slide."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Group ahead of us was extremely rude. Intentionally drove two balls and slowed down pace of play. No amenities on a “top rated course.” There was no water on the course and no cart girl. For a course that is so highly rated, I feel like it should at least have some amenities. Don’t waste your money here. Go to The Fort."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,ProsOverall course conditions very goodGood layoutPrice is good at less then 45 dollarsConCourse placed a walker with usNice guy but couldn’t keep pace
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"I played the Bear Slide with two other friends on 08/31/21. This course is divided into two completely different style nines. The front nine is a links style course and the back is mostly a parkland course with a touch of links. There are more trees on the back nine, but you will feel the wind more on the front. It was my first time playing this course and looking back I would have played a few holes differently. I would highly suggest getting a yardage book for the first timers. You have blind shots on three different holes. On hole number 10 you will need a long tee shot (depending on how far you can drive the ball) to make the green in two. On hole number 11, your tee shot must be on the left side of the fairway, towards the bunker, or you will be blocked out by trees on the right side of the fairway (Like I was). The greens rolled nice and had a decent pace to them. The whole course is in excellent shape. The staff was very friendly and professional. If you are in the area, I would highly recommend that you play this course. I will definitely be back to play it. Awesome course!"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Bearslide is always in spectacular shape and the course is really fun to play and is in my top 5 courses to play
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Course is in really good shape. Fairways are like carpet. Greens are fast but in good shape. Definitely would play again.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,It had been a few years since I’d played and took my two boys. The course was great and the experience was memorable for all of us.It was a great challenging course and we’ll be back soon.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Great course amazing layout will definitely be back. Nice and spread out nit crowded like some of the courses closer to the city.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Beautiful golf course which challenges all aspects of your game. Phenomenal value.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Love the layout. The course was in great condition. Tests every part of your game. Fantastic public course.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,A little slow on a holiday weekend but not bad. Course was in great shape!
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Played behind INdiana am qualifier. They was a delay but we has warmup balls and was able to get on course in ña timely manner
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Really challenging for the first time out but it was a really great test. Price was such great value for a course that’s easily one of the best in the state. Can’t wait to play again!
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"What a challenging course...Get the ""Course Guide "" booklet from the Pro shop...if you're a ""1st timer ""....Precision shots rewarded ! Bring an extra golf ball...or 5 ! Need to play it at least twice to appreciate & score good...."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"There's little to find fault with Bear Slide. The course is in perfect condition, plenty of challenge and excellent layout. Well managed and staff is friendly."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,This course is a little bit of a challenge but you can still score well. Greens are relatively fast for around here. Pace of play was excellent.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,It’ seems like the par 4’s were perhaps the longest I’ve played yet so challenging yet so much fun
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Green conditions excellent. Overall great course and value. Few rough spots in/around tee boxes. Overall one of best courses I’ve played in central Indiana.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Tees, fairways and greens were in great shape. I found the layout to be one of the best public courses in Indiana due to the great character. Only issue is cart-path only and some were in bad condition. I'll be back."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"It would have been nice when we checked in if they would have told us their water supply was contaminated with E.coli or even had a couple signs up other then just one on the men's bathroom mirror above one sink. I'm 5,11 not tall but the sign was above my eye line."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,And it shows. Challenging. Rewards good shots and penalizes bad ones
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,This course is BEAUTIFUL. If you are close to the area you need to stop and play. Well worth the money just STUNNING.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Fairways and tee boxes were in great shape. Greens were slow because they had recently been aerated. I'd expect the greens to be rolling great again by mid-April. The layout is one of the best public courses in Indiana easily. So much character. I'll be back again soon.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Course is open, call 317-984-3837 for tee times. Golf Now is intentionally misleading as they are not getting their cut of the tee times to sell as Hot Deals."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,The golf course is NOT closed for renovation. Call the pro shop for tee times.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Beautiful course, a little muddy when I played. Definitely play it again"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Bear Slide can be a tricky layout, but is a fair test of golf. Play it. You won’t be sorry. Greens had been aerified, and all had recovered, except 16, which they have always had problems with. Chilly day, but the lady at the turn made us some fantastic hot chocolate!!"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Very nice golf course. The only complaint is that we had a 4some and two 2somes in front of us and they weren’t budging, so we were very backed up on the front nine, on a rainy day, at 10am. Besides that, staff was friendly, course was beautiful. Highly recommend."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Amazing course just felt like the golf carts could be updated and the cart path was potholed.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"The service and snack bar are very well managed and efficient. The course itself is always in tip top shape. Regardless if your are in the middle of a 60 consecutive day drought, or it is raining, or you are playing in late November, their maintenance staff makes the course perfect every time. The also have an excellent green fee for seniors. I play all over central Indiana and Bear Slide rates up there with the best."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Challenging course but fair. Front and back nines are entirely different, with front more links style and back more traditional. Greens were excellent and rolled true, and fairways were in perfect shape."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"I've played here for years. The staff, course & beauty speaks volumes! Mark Wisman is the PRO such a great professional, he will help in any way from a simple lesson to planning an event outing for 100+ After playing here, if you""re bot impressed, chances are, nothing will!"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Was a fun course to play. The only draw back was when we checked in, we were informed it was cart path only and greens were recently aerated. Unfortunate for us, because this course is truely a BEAR under these conditions Course was wet, causing the course to play longer, and requiring a lot more waking then if we would have had a pull cart. The course was in excellent condition except for being wet and recently aerated, has a great layout and was fun to play. Look forward to play it again when course conditions are dryer and green are normal."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,We went on a very raining morning and the course was still in great shape. There were a few wet spots obviously but that can’t be helped with the amount of rain the night before.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"The course conditions were still amazing and the combination of a great layout, elevation change, and some tricky hazards really made for a wonderful round of golf."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,I highly recommend this course to anyone and will most certainly be back.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"I realize that it's the time of the year for aerification and top-dressing, but when we were charged $75 per player when we booked online, I thought maybe they had not started theirs yet. We were very disappointed to pay a premium price for less than premium conditions."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,I have always been a huge fan of this course and the variety of holes it offers; just disappointed that the first timers in my group did not have the opportunity to experience the table greens it usually has to offer. I don't know of a course that doesn't offer discounts immediately following aerification.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"The course could use a Marshall. We waited on every shot. There were at least two holes open ahead of the group in front of us. Except for that, it was a very enjoyable round. All the staff we interacted with was great. I played the course five years ago and it is every bit as nice now as it was then. I would absolutely recommend this course to the better than average golfers."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Course was generally in good shape, but Very wet in some places. Need to work on their drainage in some fairways."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"It is a scenic course in excellent condition, especially at this time of year. Extremely challenging; a shot makers course. The layout of the back nine is very contrived. It seems like they really struggled with the topography."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,This course is just perfection. Wonderful links style front nine with a back nine that's more of what you would see in America.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,It's well-maintained. Pace of play is excellent. Overall one of the best courses to play in Central Indiana.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Not sure I've ever seen the fairways in as pristine shape as today. Greens soft . . . maybe too much so? Regardless, this is my favorite piece of property in the state of IN. Walking in mid to upper 80s was a workout but we were ready for it. The closing holes were the tough stretch to walk."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Love this course set up with the front nine a links style course to the back side like a western (US) golf course. Plenty of tee options for the difficulty level you would like. Greens and fairways in great condition. Even in the world of covid the bunkers were in great condition.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"My wife and I played today and absolutely loved Bear Slide. Challenging yet fair. Wonderful condition and an amazing value. Highly recommend! Messed up the last 3 holes...B,B DB still shot 77. Thanks Bear Slide for a 3 hr round!"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,J Wilhems
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Course was cart path only today. Many fairways were soggy. The greens were in good shape so not sure why they were painted .The course would have been much better if played with drier conditions.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"I've played the course several time. I enjoy the contrast between front 9 and the back 9. The back 9 is more wooded and the front 9 is a little more links style. If I had one pet peeve there's a couple holes where you can be in the fairway and not have a very good shot at the green. If I hit the fairway I don't think I should need to hit a 30 yard hook to hit the green. That's being nit picky though, it's a nice golf course and I'll for sure be back."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,This course was a great course for someone like me who golfs casually. Playing from the White tees allowed for some mistakes off the tee but didn't punish to the point of frustration.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"There are some very fun, challenging holes with some very pretty back drops on the back 9. Great course."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Course was in nice condition. Love the practice area for both long range and short game areas. Being a senior, the rate is a nice value as well."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"This course has a beautiful mix of links and parkland style holes. There are some good elevation changes with bunkers and hazards strategically placed. Course conditioning was excellent. The greens rolled true and at a good pace with just the right amount of nuances to keep you guessing. The staff was friendly & professional. The only negative is that the clubhouse is showing its age and doesn't appear to have been updated in a very long time if ever. However, the rear deck provides a great view overlooking the finishing holes and is a nice place to gather for a post-round beverage. A great overall experience and a must play when in the Indianapolis area."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"My only knock on this course was pace of play. There are a couple of choke points on the course, HOWEVER there were two rangers out there today pushing play and we played in just under 4 hours. I don’t expect guys to run to their ball but of you are a 30 handicapper 7 practice swings isn’t going to help."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Test your golf skills. A mistake costs you.Rewards are good. Good men’s club and practice facilities.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,I play Bear Slide 8 to 10 times a year. The course is always in great shape with excellent greens. It is challenging yet very playable and has resulted in some of my best and worst scores.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,BearSlide is always a challenge. Every time I play it there are different lies with different shots. Greens are excellent with subtle breaks that are sometimes hard to read. Condition of the course is excellent. Definitely worth the drive if you like a little challenge in golf.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"I always enjoy playing Bear Slide when I can get a good Golfnow rate. The layout is challenging but fair, the greens are excellent and it is a lot of fun."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,We are privileged to have a course of this caliber locally at a great rate.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Bearslide never disappoints always in great shape friendly staff and more than enough course to challenge all golfers , greens roll well one of the best in indiana"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,I have always enjoyed playing Bear Slide. The course is tough but very fair. Large fairways with trouble if you venture out of them. The greens are always the best we play on every year. I rated the amenities a 4 but honestly don’t have need for them. The Staff is incredibly nice and helpful
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,If your into VERY difficult golf courses...the type where the holes are sometimes unfair then this is the course for you. The course is very nice...well maintained. It is designed to be difficult. Every hole is a pending disaster. Most holes are designed so a slightly off shot kills you in the hole. I did not enjoy the course because of this...being as how I don’t hit perfect shots every time. If your up for the challenge (punishment) though then give the course a whirl. Don’t say you have not been warned though.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Course played challenging. Shot placement is a premium. Ask Pro for course layout book. It makes a difference if you don’t have GPS. weather was 75, sunny and mild breeze. Greens were fast as well as fairways. Rough was longer than I expected penalizing shots, hence shot placement is a premium. Enjoyed was challenged and enjoyable. Will play again. Friendly and courteous staff."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Course is always challenging and always in excellent condition. Even open on nice days during the winter.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,This is all about golf. Pro shop is excellent but no fancy clubhouse. The head pro is almost always on duty.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Conditions are always great but you never see workers out on the course.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Golf Now shows the course is closed until April 30. NOT TRUE. Open for play every day. Call for tee times.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Awesome course, love the layout... definitely playing it again"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"AWESOME COURSE! You need a range finder, the course is not marked for yardage very well. Make sure you bring extra golf balls especially if you spray the ball a little. Visibility is challenging due to tall grass and mounds. Not surprisingly if you hit it in the fairway, you find your golf ball!!"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"My favorite place to play in the area. Great layout, and the price is right."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Pretty warm and very windy the day I played. Shot selection is very important on this course. Especially on the back nine. Definitely rewards the player that can control his distance. A lot of doglegs and yardages that will leave you between clubs. Greens were firm and pretty fast but rolled true and had little to no bounce in them. Fairways and rough are in perfect shape. Bunkers looked nice but I didn't play out of one so I can't tell you about them. Looking forward to playing here again! Great layout and conditions!
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"The actual course is pretty nice. You can find better value closer to town and find better service. Course was pretty empty on a Saturday afternoon yet the ranger decided to folllow us the entire front 9. Also, we were pushed out of the clubhouse at the turn despite traffic being light on the course."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Can’t even begin to say how great this course is. From the beginning on the practice facility to the final beer after 18, it one of the top public courses in the state. The course is always in great condition. Mark and his staff are friendly and will always work to get you through a successful round."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"This course is great, you have two different nines, which are both in great shape."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Bear Slide is still one of my personal favorites. Course was in very nice shape for this time of year, though someone had a little too much fun with the sprinklers and really soaked it in front of us. But, they put the work in there and it shows. Well worth the accolades it receives, and worth a go if you're in/near Indy."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"From the time I rolled onto the course until I left, my experience was first-rate! The staff was friendly, the course beautifully laid out and immaculate. Each hole was a unique test. Many holes had a park-like beauty. Greens were fast and true. What’s not to like?!!"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"The course was in excellent condition, great staff, nice starter, good amenities. My only compliant is the short grass fairways felt like hard pan. We haven't had much rain, and I am not used to those types of fair ways, but I bladed a few (yes my fault), but I had to consistently play the ball back and one less club because there was no taking divot and the ball wasn't fluffed up. But I would play this course again!"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,I played Bear Slide for the second time today and couldn’t have been more satisfied with the layout and conditions. I’ll be back!
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Course layout was challenging but fun. Front 9 was a links style while the back 9 was totally different. I will definitely be back.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Played on July 4th with my son and although it was a 2 hour drive it was well worth it!! Everything is first rate starting with the practice/driving range to the cart/cart paths to the friendliness of all the employees!! Fairways are fairly generous (except a couple of holes on back 9) and greens are medium to large and rolled perfect+ you could hold a green with a well played approach shot!! We were extremely impressed with the layout and flow of the course.Wished we’d played it sooner than now, but we will be back again & bring some buddies along next time. To get a GN Hot Deal is a steal.Trust me it’s worth the drive!!"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"I always enjoy Bear Slide. It can get a little wet with rain, but with the recent hot weather, it was perfect. I really like the layout of the course. There are some weird holes on the back, but keeps you on your toes. Definitely recommend making a trip up to this course when you can. If it gets windy, it can be a tough course. Without wind, it is challenging, but fair."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Great layout, fun to play, excellent condition and superior value for the money. Front 9 is links-style and back 9 is parkland. Nice to have some elevation changes in the middle of flat Indiana. Subtle yet challenging greens in just about perfect condition. It's a pure golf place - it's in the middle of nowhere and the clubhouse and facilities aren't much to talk about (although the staff was great). It really does deserve its very high ranking on golfadvisor."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Might be best public course in Indiana. It definitely is one of my favorites!!
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,The front 9 was good but the back nine is layed out like a mini golf course - goofy golf for sure!!! All 9 holes were blind shots and ridiculous! Wouldn’t play here again!
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Greens were excellent as always. Overall the quality was really good especially given the wet season so far. Country Club quality at an average price.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Great round on great course improved by brief threat of intense weather that cleared the course of the faint hearted— or perhaps people with loved ones. We stayed and played couple extra balls here and there it was so open. Friendly staff, challenging course that always gets me."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Course was in exceptional shape for early April. Layout is very good. Staff at check in was extremely accommodating and my 14yr old son and I had a great time!!
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Fun and challenging.... the back nine was my favorite. I found the greens to be pretty quick and if they hadn’t been roughed up due to rains and heavy footed golfers, they would have rolled terrific. I would definitely play again and again but at $65 it is a little more than I can routinely budget"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,The course as well as the staff are top-notch! I would highly recommend you play this course!!
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,BS is always a treat. Great conditions fast greens pace of play and staff is amazing. A lot of places could learn from what they do at BS. Thanks and we will be back ASAP.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Love this course. Great variety of tees, well manicured and difficulty for all levels."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"One of the best around without a doubt! This is a challenging course that requires you to think and execute your shots! I live on the south side and the 45 minute drive was absolutely worth it, I will be back ASAP to play it again!"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Only hitch on our round was the outing going on simultaneously. The guys in the outing were really slow, but conditions were tough, so it was understandable. I’m always amazed by bear slide, it’s always in great shape. Awesome day."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,What a fun course - every hole is different. Incredible layout.Cannot play this course enough. Loved it.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"This is a great course, but even better were the staff. From Pro Shop to Snack Bar the staff listened, responded and made suggestions to improve our day."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Greens just plugged (and we knew this) were the only issue on course. Tees and fairways in great shape. TLC apparent at every turn. Played in less than 4 hours. Traps were meticulously maintained which was a nice surprise as many public courses have trap maintenance on low priority.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,This course is a must for central Indiana golfers and I was shocked with the slow pace of play on a Wednesday in early October. There were some very below average golfers in 3 consecutive foursomes ahead of my group and the round would have taken 5 1/2 hours and I had to leave on the 14th hole. I'll be back but will try to find a better time to play.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Fantastic golf course. Greens are perfect, lightening fast! Can’t wait to go back."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Bear Slide is a great course with many challenges and options of difficulty with the multiple tee options. Course was in great condition with some wear on the greens as expected this late in the season.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,I hadn’t played here since I moved to Florida in 2005 and I was not disappointed it’s still a great course
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Bear Slide is one of the top 5 courses the Indianapolis area without question. I hadn't played it yet this year, but I am glad I finally did. it is in outstanding shape and as good as anything that I've played in town. The staff is always friendly and professional. They are doing things the right way at bear slide"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,This is a wonderful golf course that is in excellent condition. Challenging course that offers different tee options depending on your skill level.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Bear Slide golf course is a great experience with a definite variety of holes and shots. The two nines are pretty much different from one another with the front 9 being more ""linksy"" and the back 9 more parkland. The course gets a LOT of play, but is in good shape for the most part. The greens were a little worn, but definitely playable. The staff is friendly and welcoming. Lunch or a snack is affordable. This little gem might be a little off the beaten path, but is WELL worth your effort to play it!"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,I Love Bear Slide because it’s a great test of golf. I’m a 7 handicap and like going here to see how my game can hold up.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,still one of the best layouts in central Indiana-- conditions were tremendous and greens as good as any around
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"This is as always, one of the best courses in the state! Play it if u get the opportunity!!!!"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"The course was in great shape. The starter was very helpful in getting me off the first tee a little earlier than my tee time, and he did a good job of managing everyone who was on the golf course. Teeboxes and fairways are in great shape. Greens are faster than most public courses in the area, but not lightning fast. They rolled very true. I look forward to going back."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"This was my first time playing Bear Slide. The course was difficult. The layout was fantastic. Some of the Fairways were extremely tight. Some greens were fast, some were slower. Overall, I would recommend this course."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Been a fan and customer of Bear Slide for over a decade. Course is currently in best condition I’ve ever played it. Greens are immaculate, even the 16th which I know is a struggle year in year out! Played early (before 830a) so pace of play was fine. Hopefully future customers are respectful and help to keep tees and greens in their current state the remainder of this season."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Amazing course and GREAT value. Challenging layout that demands you use every club in the bag. Greens roll fast. Only knock is that it doesn't hold water great...Cart Path only after rain.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Loved the course. Played with two people who had played course so made the layout better to understand. GPS or course layout on scorecard would have made it spectacular.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Said it before and I'll say it again, this is the best course around the Indy area. It is in phenomenal shape tee-to-green, especially after the rough winter. Even the notorious 16th I've written about before is in good shape. Greens were fast and true, rough was lush. Best I've seen it in the 3 years I've been playing it."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Props to the maintenance guy for presenting this masterpiece, but also defending it when players disregarded the cart signs and drove wherever they wanted near greens. Never saw that before out of a maintenance guy (as opposed to a ranger), but his direct style during the interaction deserves major kudos for defending his course from their ignorance."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Since you guys at the course are reading these, how about a Blue/White combo tee on the card?"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Course was in great condition for this time of year. It’s a golfer’s golf course, no b.s., just a great course. I do wish you would cut the fairways in a different fashion, don’t like that half up, half back, but that was our only complaint."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Thanks
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"ps - the greens were lightning fast, which was amazing for this early in the year."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Very well laid out course. The greens were fast the fairways meticulously maintained and the friendliest staff I’ve seen in the state.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"The only downside is they never seem to keep an eye on pace of play. There was a foursome backing up the whole course. Otherwise, beautiful course, challenging layout, always in great condition. I'd love if they put in new tees somewhere between the whites and blues. Big jump from 5900 to 6600. Tees that play around 6300 would be ideal. Anyway, this is easily one of the best in town. Even when it's a slow round I still really enjoy my time there. I love the difference in course style between the front and back. Links/prairie style layout is boring for an entire 18, same for woodland style, this one has both."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Wonderful course. Great condition for late fall. Tough, but fair layout. Had a great time and I will be returning."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Very fun time. A little chilly but sun came out and it was great. Very few people on the course so we took our time and enjoyed the whole experience. Very interesting layout and holes.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,It is a fun course with a dramatic change between front 9 and back 9. Great play ground for golfers! I wish the course has a bear statue hidden in the woods and a slide instead of steps at the 18th hole green.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,Enjoyed the course but due to weather had to keep cart on path and this created a problem with club selection and cart placement. The front had aerated greens and that made it difficult to putt all day. Loved the layout and lots of challenging shots made the day fun.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"First time my son and I have played this course. It is definitely worth the trip. One of my favorites in Indiana. Pace of play was a little slow at times, but not awful."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,I had not played this course in a few years and had forgotten how beautiful it is. It is well worth getting to from anywhere around greater Indy. Just a great track.
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"we got first 9 holes done in 1 hour and 45 min then hit a wall. next 9 was 3 hours 15 min. two 5 somes were in the 2 groups ahead of us. For the amount of money, better control of people should be done--tell them to pick up or put them on a time. It really led to a lot of exasperation. I do not think I will play here again unless they fix this. The course is great but pace of play was horrible. too much wating around."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,We stopped on the way back from Kohler. It had 4 and a half stars and so we thought Ok we'll try it not expecting much. The staff was great changing our time as we thought it was central time]e zone and it wasn't. I was impressed with the conditions and the difficulty due to the native grasses especially around t the bunkers. I would highly recommend. You will enjoy it!
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Bear Slide is a GREAT layout. Off the beaten trail . . . and picturesque. Part links, part forest . . . a tale of two different nines. Each hole memorable which is my barometer for a course of significance. Clubhouse build remains elusive but the course itself offsets the absence of glamourous facilities. Range and practice areas are EXCELLENT also."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"Staff is extra superb! Course is good value and well maintained,!,,"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"This course is very beautiful and quite challenging. You need to play using course management. I enjoyed the fact that you have to play different shots and clubs throughout the round. The only downside would be, if you have bad knees, it may not be the best choice. There is a lot of walking up and down hills."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"I play several places around the Indianapolis area and I think Bear Slide is the best. It's in great condition despite the weather and the layout is beautiful. Great value for the money, and a must play If you are in the area!"
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,"My first time in Indiana and first course I played at. Overall very good course. Rate of play was a little slow for a weekday as there were a few foursomes with older people in front. But the conditions were great, layout was decent and pretty well kept. I would come back again if I'm in the area and if there is a good Golfnow deal."
Bear Slide Golf Club,5681-bear-slide-golf-club,A challenging course yet enjoyable and playable. Several tee options giving different vantage points. Course was in great shape. Greens were fast and true to line as always.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Course was in good shape based on the time of year.No complaints on anything course related but….I know particularly this time of year, course marshalls don’t exist.We had played the exact tee time/ day (1pm mid week) one week earlier & finished at near darkBut in a respectable 4 hrs.This round was a miserable 5+ hrs of watching a 4some stand over shots & particularlyputts for what seemed like days!The several 2some behind us couldn’t even finish due to darkness.OPINION: golf is already WAY too expensive & WAY too difficult to expect the nextgeneration of youth to want to continue playing 18 holes that takes over 5 hrs.Someone, somewhere needed to address this issue years ago……but nothing ever changes.Hopefully the game endures, once all of us old guys are gone."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,from tee box to greens course in great shape. had not played in about 5 years. played in extremely windy conditions but able to keep ball in fairways. greens were red fast and rolling nicely. only recommendation would be to place a sign off no. 8 with direction to no. 9.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Perfect as always. It was windy which made it extra fun. Greens were great, fairways were great, all of it. Just a gem of a course that I take everyone to play."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"The course is very challenging. If you do not stay in the fairway or happen to be in one of the many many sand traps, it is difficult to even find your ball. Even though the course looks somewhat flat and wide open, it is deceivingly hilly with lots of undulating lies. The electric carts do not have GPS or any other electronics but they are smooth and fast! If you can hit the ball straight and choose the appropriate tees for your distance/ability, then you will enjoy this course immensely. If not then, it could be a miserable day."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Overall, for a great deal due to aerating. However, standard price for 18 is extremely fair. This course is well kept, challenging, and has excellent food. My only suggestion is to put ball washers out on holes."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Never seen so many hills in my life until I got into the foothills of the Allegheny mountains. With all joking aside the course is surrounded by hills and satraps with the fairways tightly tucked in. I swore I’d lose a dozen golf balls but did not lose one since I was able to hit 90% of the fairways off of my drive. The short game and putting boosted my score into the 90s which I figured this course would be tough. The greens are challenging and pretty fast. I saw this course on Gold Now last year and said this was a bucket list course and I can now mark this off of one of several courses that we play. I play time was not held up until we teed off on 10 that’s most likely because of food and beverage stops after the 9th hole. Staff was very friendly and again the course was not hard if you are on your game. Simply a beautiful course and links style playing with hundreds of bunkers to avoid. Price is fairly high but one time a year is ok for me.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Bunkers in horrible condition. I played course 15 years ago. It was in much better shape including the bunkers. Not worth the 95.00 I paid to play course.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"great day at Purgatory. we started play around 3pm to take advantage of lower fees. love this course, greens very challenging along with fairway bunkers everywhere! cart paths need some work and wish they had more GolfNow deals so we could play here more!thanks!"
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"I had a great day, course was greatI enjoyed my round!"
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Don’t be scared by the name of the course. It is playable for all levels with seven tee boxes.Keep the head cover on the putter if putting downhill!
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"The practice facilities are great if you’re looking to chip, putt and go to the range. The staff is very friendly and helpful especially the starter.Now for the actual course. Holes 10 and 11 look great since they are right on the road when you drive in. However, every other hole is in terrible shape. Fairways look awful, sand traps have massive rocks in them the size of the palm of my hand, greens are bumpy causing your ball to go everywhere. The ground is way too hard. There was trash on almost every hole, trash cans overflowing, the bathrooms around the course are disgusting. For paying how much they want you to pay to play, I’d expect a lot more upkeep of the grounds. Very disappointed."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,This is a good track but I feel over priced. Carts need updated with gps and the bunkers are trash! I ruined a60 degree wedge in a bunker when it hit a rock as big as my golf ball just under the surface of the sand. So I’ll doubt I’ll be back
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Always in great condition very friendly staff!!! Sam Foley is a great teaching instructor too!!!
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Courses in good shape, except for all the bunkers are trash with Roxanne very little sand if you’re charging $100 for a tee time you should at least keep the bunkers in average shape"
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Have only played a few times in the past couple years but feel that the overall conditions have improved. Tee boxes much improved, cart paths have received some attention, but still need work. Bunkers were mostly OK but could use addition sand and less rocks. Fairways were good. Played in about 4 1/4 hours which was good for this course. Don't remember seeing any water stations which were normally available."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"The course conditions were great, but the bunkers need maintenance, needing raked."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Great course (difficult), good conditioning, bar & restaurant are nice...but they do not monitor pace of play which inevitably leads to slow or bad players ruining the experience for everyone else..."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Perfect example of a links course in central indiana. Great value and very challenging with lots of sand and tall heather. Highly recommend.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Course was in very good condition. Range and practice green nice for a warm up and preparation for the round.Greens were not terribly fast but had a lot of undulation. Knowing where to hit and not hit will be helpful the next time around.This is a links style course with several blind shots. I used SwingU for overall hole shape and distances but difficult to align view with what was in front of you. Playing with someone that knows the course is a must.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"The course is clean and challenging, certainly not for the average or beginning golfer. We played a day after rain so perhaps it caused compaction on the bunkers but most were rock hard to hit out of. No ranger to start people off so we had people on us before we even left the first hole a few minutes into our tee time."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Bar and food selection was stellar and the staff was nice and attentive. The bathrooms were absolutely disgusting. I can only blame the nasty men who don’t respect facilities. Every stall was blown up and trashed with toilet paper and plenty nicotine pouches in the urinal. I pray for the staffer who had to handle that nonsense.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"For the exorbitant price, you expect the facilities to be spotless but for the price you could rock some great courses twice."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Great layout and interesting greens but with bunkers being such an integral part of the challenge, they need maintenance not neglect. Disappointing considering the height end greens fee. Staff & practice facilities are excellent."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Bunkers are full of stones, some up to 1.5” round. Unfortunately I damaged my 8 iron, which was brand new in one of the bunkers."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,A small suggestion would be upgrading the carts. Pretty old and no GPS.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,I love this course. It's challenging but also somewhat forgiving with the open layout. Nice having this type of course so close to home.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Tee boxes, fairways, and greens all were impeccable. Greens rolled fast and true. Staff was friendly and helpful. Only complaint would be for a course with 100 plus traps, it would be nice if they were all in about the same condition. Some, like the practice trap had little to no sand. Others were light and fluffy. Course is challenging enough without different conditions on each hole."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Enjoyed the course. Very links oriented. It’s more a huge bunker interrupted by some grass. LOL. Target golf with so many tiered greens and forced carries.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Fun and challenging course.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Only complaint was pace of play but not too bad.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Will definitely return!
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"This course had been on my bucket list since I first heard about it a couple of years ago. The name alone was intriguing as well as the opportunity for some great pro-shop swag. I even stopped by the course last October, as I was traveling through the region. After dozens of online visits, YouTube vids and conversations with other golfers, I booked my first round at this ""destination course"". Upon arrival from Monroe, Ohio, Justin, who was working the Pro Shop was extremely friendly and very helpful in getting my round off to a great start. This course lived up to every bit of the hype! It was not simply a golf course, but rather a complete golf experience. Every hole is unique with its own nickname that gives it its own personality. ""Hells Half Acre"", is exactly that! Every hole was memorable and could have been finishing holes, at most golf courses. The conditions of the greens and fairways were immaculate. This was by far, the most fun Ive had on a course, over the past 50 rounds. The experience and the memories were worth every penny. This would be a $200-300+ round of golf at a vacation destination such as Orlando or Palm Springs. While the course is extremely challenging, with more temptations to serve ones pride and ego than in the book of Genesis, it offers a wide variety of tee positions for all levels of golfers. Ive only been back into the game for a year and a half and managed an 82 from the whites. Seriously though...the amount of bunkers provides more sand than a Dubai course. I played by myself on this round but I cant wait to share the experience with a couple of friends."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Easier on the front 9 than back 9, which lulls you into a false sense of confidence."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"I loved the layout, the amenities, the staff. Everything was awesome and will definitely play here again."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,The golf course was great and the clubhouse and BBQ restaurant were awesome
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Greens were rolling EXTREMELY WELL! A windyday so my score ballooned to 90 but great condition. The only knock (and this is sooo petty that I hate to bring it up, but....) the cart paths need some attention. I would play this 100 times with bumpy paths because the layout and condition of the actual course is superior"
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,The course was challenging to navigate. It was not always clear where the green was when you were on the tee station.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,I use 18Birdies app to see each hole but sometimes it was not clear where the green was.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"For off-season, the greens were in great shape. Even the sand was in good shape as well."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Very fun course! Lots of hills water sand nice challenging greens big greens! Sweet fairways!
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Wow this is one of the nicer courses I’ve played. Well worth the money
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Course is in great shape. It's a fun but challenging round
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"First time at this track. I loved every minute of it despite not shooting my best score (putter fail). From pictures these holes look so intimidating, but you have more room for misses than it appears. Bunkers were excellent, which seems to be rare at other courses. Staff was super nice. Definitely will be back!"
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"We played on a 50 degree windy day in December. Great course. It would be a challenge on a warm day in August. We played up a set of tees and still were overmatched. Course is fair. Difficult, but fair. Greens are tough."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Purgatory GC is one of the best places to play for your money. Challenging but is forgiving when played smartly. Staff is great!
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"1st - it’s still good enough to enjoy2- it’s in the worst shape I’ve seen it in years …. Fairways were in pretty rough shape and greens haven’t fully healed from aeration…3 - they are making some improvements, but that will only benefit golfers in the future, and make the present experience a little less enjoyable"
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,The course is in horrible shape. They have seriously damaged most of the fairways with recent over seeding and aeration. Some of the cart parts are dirt with huge ruts. They are repaving most of the cart paths but it is obvious that course maintenance is a low priority.This course use to be a showcase property but no longer.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,It been many years since I played Purgatory but I was very disappointed to find the course in very poor condition. The fairways and greens were always immaculate so I was sad to see mower ruts in the fairways and greens.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"It all depends on how you are playing the day you play this course. If you are 20+ handicap, it will be a rough day. Well, anyone can have a rough day here. That being said, the rewards for good shots are very fulfilling. This round, the greens were very firm and very difficult to hold. Ball marks in need of repair on the greens were few and far between. It was very difficult to stop the ball. Granted it had been very dry for a long time this season. All in all, love it"
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"The course was a little dry,however the greens were fast and ran true. The fairways were well watered and the ball sat up on them nicely."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"This used to be a really good course and a really fun course to golf. Obviously they’re just not doing any upkeep on it whatsoever. You walk across the sand traps and you barely leave a footprint. It’s just hard rock pebble garbage. Go to the bar and sit down to get a drink after the round and no one even waits on you, it’s just really falling off. Whoever is managing this club does not know what customer services."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Purgatory is a great, challenging course that is in great shape. Highly recommended"
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Your opinion of this course will be based upon the quality of your goof game. If you are hitting the ball well, this course will test every aspect of it, If you arent very consistent, this course will eat you alive. if you play the tees that fit your handicap, it is a fair test. if you try to be brave and play further back tees, you will regret it quickly. Course is in great condition. My only negative thing to say about the course...the cart paths are like rumble strips, land mines, and mulholland drive in may spots"
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Lots of sand here! Fairways had a few spots without grass. Greens were true and fast. 4:40 round is a little slow in my book. Will definitely be back.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"For the amount of play and weather that this course gets- they clearly do everything they can to keep it in good shape. Definitely worth the money a few times a summer - typical weekend round times for a popular course- We played with a pretty experienced 3-some in 5 hours Saturday morning,"
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"The course was in very good shape when we played. We had to wait because of rain, but it was still very playable. Even though I didn't have my best round, it was very enjoyable. I expect another round would be better knowing the layout."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Caught this hot deal and was on the tee box a hoir later.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"My first, but not last, shot at this amazing track. Top notch conditions, facilities and staff. Be sure to choose the right tees to best enjoy this gem."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Really have enjoyed Purgatory for years. Great well designed layout with great wholes bunkers and water. Greens roll nice and staff is very friendly. Usually much less busy than nearby couses. Will be back, it is a great value."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Club house and Amenities- They have a great Staff, Club house was extremely clean and the prices where more around the average of any club house."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Layouts- First thing you need to understand this is almost a 5 stars course. I start with most of the course is bunkers everywhere also you have some holes that you don’t even know where is the flag or what line to take thank God we played with ppl who played there before. The fairways where tight (not complaining) half of the holes could have been played with 3 wood or Irons. The Tee box and fairways where in good condition it’s just full of uneven shots even if you hit the fairways. My favorite holes where 1st, 10th and they have some good par 3’s. This course is challenging do to ball placement first shot out the tee box is a big factor the course have a lot of hills with a lot of unknown spots for golfers who are playing the course for the first time."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Will probably play it again but only with Hot deals really was expecting a better course layout.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"I have been playing there 4-5 times in a season for years. I noticed that new paved cart path and new natural tall grass growth, however this course is known for its bunkers, some of which have too many sizable rock and pebble stones, for which they need to work on."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,One of my favorite golf courses I have ever played in
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"PurgatoryGC was in as good a shape as I’ve seen it in the last 3-4 years. Thumbs up on turf ….. greens were in great shape with good roll and pace, but not lightning quick.We need to be able to rate the golfers on the course as TOO MANY millennials, narcissists, and disrespectful golfers tee it up here and most everywhere. LEAVE your speakers at home - the rest of us did not purchase concert tickets ….. we purchased golf tix. If you have to listen to music, use some headphones.you narcissist.CONSIDER others everywhere you go IN PUBLIC. REDPECT other people’s property, time, and space. You do not own the course….. you are only a time share customer at a golf course. KEEP golf carts on pavement when it exists - DONT park your cart up on or near the tee boxes. IF I can hear YOUR music it is TOO LOUD. The same 4some out there was guilty of all of the above. YOU people not only ruin golf for others….. you are what’s wrong with America: selfish and disrespectful."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"The greens were the fastest that I have played this year. Some spots were in ""less than Purgatory condition"" but that did not diminish the round. A great Bloody Mary too!!"
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"This is my home course. Absolutely amazing course layout and awesome staff. Usually awesome course conditions. Played last Thursday everything was perfect. Greens were lightning. Played 6 days later (for more money) and the greens were full of sand, super slow. A little notice or a discount would have been appreciated.That said give it a few weeks and you won’t regret it. If it was in Indy, this is easily worth $100 plus. The drive out is just worth $80 / Round"
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,This is a challenging course. I think I will enjoy it even more after playing it a few times. It was hard to know where to aim on some holes not having played there. Plenty of tee options which allows to adjust for conditions.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Read somewhere that the course was in really good shape for it being mid winter. The greens were not good. They look like they are going to have some issues with Poa in there greens come spring or summer. The carts were ok, nothing special, i.e. GPS monitors. It was nowhere near worth $69. I understand that courses make extra cash in the winter, but they had 0 amenities. No bar, beer in the cooler. Men's bathroom was the family bathroom, A lot of tickets tack stuff, but no $69 worth or 150 mile drive each way."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Bunkers need to refill with sand, it was nothing but pebbles"
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Absolutely beautiful course. Value far exceeded what I paid for. Tough layout, tough conditions, beautiful holes."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Purgatory is a challenging course but is fun for all skill levels. It's always in excellent condition.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"If your game is on and good, this is a very fun and extreme challenge. If not, however still a great track, it can be absolutely brutal. Great course, great condition, keeps you thinking on every shot."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"I like new new cart path, but not enough, please continue to improvie them."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,The course was amazing and beautiful. The pace of play made it almost unbearable though as we were waiting at least 15 minutes at every tee box and completed 9 holes in 3 1/2 hours.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Love how peaceful this course is and the challenge of it. For fall it was in good shape. Everyone was taking advantage of great weather in November so pace was slow.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"This is fall golfing time and the course had areas mowed down for the winter. The greens were fast because the punch/dressing time was done weeks ago and the greens are cut short and prepped for the winter. This was my second time this year playing the course. We played ready golf as a foursome the entire round with very little waiting and played at 4/5 hours. Golfers should plan on a longer time per a round because there is longer walks almost every hole from the cart to the green and the cart signs around the greens are back quite a ways from the green. So, it adds to your time for the round."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Enjoyed the day and course. Returning player. Only reason 5 stars not given all around would be the result of cart path conditions. Standing water in various locations with challenging navigation around surface conditions here and there.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"glad to see new cart path, but old cart path needs to be repaved too."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"One of the most challenging courses to play in my book. Beautiful and definitely a pro tour layout lookalike! It was fun, exciting, and challenging.. definitely a must play if you haven't, and a definite must on a replay. Greens are maculant condition and speeds are lightning fast... Super fun.!!!"
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Purgatory is conditioned the best it has been since it opened. Other than removing a bunker in front of 1 green, they’ve made some great changes. And if you haven’t played here because of conditions/greens issues, those are nonstarters this year. Great job Purg!"
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"have played here several times - love the course. Tough layout for my game, which is why I like it. Sadly, after 11 holes the pace-of-play stopped in it's tracks. It took 40 minutes to play #12 and looked as though it might take another 2.5 hours to finish the round. I, and 1 other guy (a member) decided to call it quits so we just left. WHERE IS A RANGER.?.?.?...I'm semiretired..I could do the job! LOL. Seriously, no one was there to watch pace of play or help."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,this course is tough! Hope you can hit your tee shots straight becuase you’ll get punished otherwise. But it was super fun. In great shape. Chatted with the started for about 10 mins before the tee time to kinda get the lay off the land. Turns out I knew him from highschool. After the round was finished the bar was closed (7p sunday evening) but the staff member was able to sell my buddy and I a beer anyways and let us chill on the patio as the sun set. 10/10 experience and will 100% be coming back.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Big surprise- golf course design and condition outstanding.Very tough layout.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,So many bunkers. Some of them need some attention for sure. It's hard to play a blast out of hardpan in a greenside bunker. Overall a beautiful layout and very challenging course. Play the correct tees for your game and it will make things much more fun.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,The course was interesting and certainly a major challenge the longer the tees you choose. My only complaints are too many single players - we let four singles through during our round and the lack of any water to drink on the course. There was only one (accessible from the front and back nine) that i saw and it had essentially no water.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Greens were fast and pin placements were challenging. Best condition I've seen this year
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,The course layout is great. Pace of play a little slow. The course is in great condition. The staff is extremely friendly and the food is great. I would definitely recommend this course and I will definitely play this course again!!
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Half the course is an unplayable lie because there’s fescue everywhere. And the green side bunkers are impossible to get your club under the ball so you just end up bouncing the club under the ball and hitting the ball over the green. And since there’s like 200 bunkers in the course that creates a problem. Rocks in the bunkers, bunkers very hard."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,The greens are amazing it seems like every green with the exact same speed as the last one
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Well maintained course that can be made as tough as you want it to be depending on which tee box you choose.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,I play a lot of courses in the Indianapolis area and this year a lot of course conditions are lacking due to the heat and drought. Not Purgatory! The course was so good! Kudos to the pro! We can't wait to come back!
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Great value for the money as a lot of courses have moved into the $70 per round market - the difference is the courses are not that good!
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"1st time at Purgatory, and wow was I impressed. It started with the staff, and how welcomed we felt. Next, the course was in pristine condition and provided us with a challenging round. Fairway bunkers were well positioned to make you NOT play the long game, strategy is key to this course."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Can't wait to go back again - this will become a regular course for me now!
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,The common statement made about Purgatory is that it is a scary course. It is scary long. The number of sand traps are also scary. I disagree completely.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,The length of the course will force you to use every club in your bag a few different times during the round. The traps are really not placed there as penalties on most of the holes. Most of the traps rather guide your eye as to where to aim. This is a well thought out design which will keep you from getting bored.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Everything was great, except water stations and restrooms on course were either empty, dirty , or not enough."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,The course was in good shape. It is a hard course but a lot of fun. The food is exceptional. The staff at the course are great. We will definitely play here again.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Don’t forget your sand wedge. IMO top 5 course in the greater metro area. Beautiful and well kept. Expect to bump your handicap up 3-5+
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Love the course. I would play it more often if it were a little closer to my house.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,From the starter to the restaurant staff everything was very good. Course was in good condition considering the extreme amount of rain it received.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,For a Tuesday afternoon the pace of play was very slow. No ranger on course to keep play moving.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Good layout, greens rough, course wet from all the rain. Greens were not cut which I understand but they were patchy at best as and slow. Good food, wait staff was amazing."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Great layout that can be confusing at times. Best to play with someone who has played the course before. I would recommend better signage on the course and path. The path is in poor condition is the only real negative about the place. Nice practice facilities. Greens are true and usually quick. If you hate the sand, you may want to play somewhere else. Bunkers everywhere. Play the correct tees for your level and it’s a fair and tough challenge. My kids think it’s cool that the course has a “theme” like a mini golf course. Hah!"
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,This course is fantastic and can’t wait to come back. Always worth the money and time to get in 18 here.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Wonderful course. You better like bunkers. Nice sand. Good pace. Enjoyable day!
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Course is in the best shape it's been in years. Greens roll very well. Course plays difficult and fun. Staff is friendly and the practice areas are very nice as well.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Purgatory is truly one of the best courses in Indiana. Great layout, very challenging, fast greens, great shape overall."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,The course was in great condition. Wide open and pace of play was quick and design is spectacular.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"I golfed this course looking for a local course for my wife and two friends to golf before we drove back to Michigan following the Morgan Wallen concert the night before. It was fun, challenging, in great shape with a nice layout. Worth the $ in my opinion. It’s not super expensive but not a cheap course. I’d definitely golf there again if I’m ever in the neighborhood."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Had a great time here! Tee to green course was in great shape.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Best conditions to date been playing there since clubhouse was a single wide
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,It is one of the best in IN
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Nice course, fun to play. Careful as the pace of play was slow almost did didn’t make 18."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,The pace of play was awful! It’s generous to call it slow! The greens were bad to due to recent airation…which would have been nice to know BEFORE the round.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,It was slow…miserably slow. People hitting into your group slow because the 4 slowpokes in front refused to move or step aside. There were at least 2 open holes in front of them so ….
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,As much as this place charges…one would think a ranger may be on course. But…alas…no. Perhaps SLOW play is another thing they do to make the course difficult? It is called Purgatory after all.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Amazing course. A must play. Great amenities, staff and instruction."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Very challenging but a great treat. Course is in great condition, greens are near perfect."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Literally a great course but man was it a doozie! Bunker heck is more like it! Bring extra golf balls!
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Literally baking in the sun. But the course is excellent
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"This course has 120+ bunkers. It rained for a few days before my round so I expected wet fairway and bunkers. Being able to hit bunker shot would be the key to play this course so I would not recommend playing here when it's wet, but we still had fun. Course difficulty is above average so this course is fun for low to mid handicappers. I highly recommend to people who likes challenging course."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"I've played this course for the past 6-7 years and I almost feel like it's skating by on it's past successes. I'll say most the tee boxes and fairways live up to the $80 price tag however outside of that there are some issues. The cart paths are in horrific condition which leads to the other problem of rutting all over the rough areas. Really need to invest in some path upgrades imo. Outside of that there are some greens that were pretty shocking certainly lead by 13....what is that about?!?! Anyway, for the cost, average value at best."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,This place is really really good. It’s one of my favorite places to play. Pace of play has been great every time I’ve ever been here which is huge for me
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Loved playing Purgatory again, hit the ball really well but got my butt kicked! This is easily one of the most beautiful courses in the area and is one of the only courses I would play knowing I’m not going to score well."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,As good as it gets in Indianapolis!
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Pros: firm fast conditions everywhere—greens were amazing
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Cons: Cart paths are in need of repair, but I’m not playing golf off asphalt."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Can’t wait to get back!
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,My favorite place to play in the Indy area. Greens are in great shape.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"I was very surprised to find the course in such poor condition. The greens were more sand than grass, dandelions growing on the tee boxes, rough not mown,. Generally deteriorating conditions everywhere. It’s a shame because historically Purgatory is a top 10 public course in Indiana. $65 is way too much to pay to play this course right now."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Love everything about this place. Such a fun course to play and always in great shape! Greens were best in the area given the time of year. They rolled just like they do mid summer, perfect."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"The course has potential. It might be better in the summer. Greens rolled well but had some discoloration (fungus) that it looks like they are working on getting under control. Again, it does not affect the roll of the ball. It’s just not the prettiest and makes reading the greens a little more difficult. I also expected more tall fescue for a links style course. That’s just a recommendation. Not a knock on the course. It may also hide some of the patchiness of the grass further into the rough. The last thing is the bunkers. The sand is nice. They seemed to have good drainage and are in good shape. But they should really rockhound them to get rid of the the stones. For the price of the course, I would expect a little more, but overall it is a good course."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Had a good experience. Pace was ok but we waited a few minutes on every hole.Greens played better than they looked but understandable this time of the year. Thanks
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Too early to say much. Course was challenging as usual. Everything was as expected.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Nice course a little bit on the pricey side. 13 green was a little rough but other than that the course is in really nice shape
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,I enjoyed the layout...the grass on the greens was a little rough being that it is mixture. Once it fills in as the weather improves should be fine. Looks forward to playing it again
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Purgatory is in great shape for spring golf. It is my go to course because it's always in great shape.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"5 hour round behind 4 kids who played slow with multiple balls in hooded sweatshirts. No etiquette. We waited for them on each hole and they never offered to allow us to play through. One of our two carts died on the 6th hole. Called clubhouse three times. No answer. Had to push cart in to change after front 9. Second cart died on 14th hole. Called clubhouse three more times. No answer. Other cart had to push us around the course the rest of round. Had to leave dead cart in parking lot after round as it wouldn’t make to you the return area. Staff member called us, used profanity towards us and was very aggressive. Said we aren’t allowed back. Not a a great experience. Plenty of good courses locally with friendlier staff."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,The course was in fairly good condition but the cart paths need to be repaved badly And the tee boxes on the practice range were in poor condition. as there was no sod in the setup area. You practically hit balls with a hard pan.I just expected more from the course overall.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,GreensRolled better then they lookedFairwaysVery goodTeesVery goodBunkersFor most part fairShould have played more forward tee box’sWas paired with another 2 some thatWas playing wrong tees also
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Greens were average, traps were like concrete. Realise it's fall, so hopefully they get the money they need to bring the course back to what it used to be"
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"A fun course with a few holes on the back 9 being pretty memorable (11 is very pretty and the closing 3 holes are fun). They had just aerated the greens which while completely understandable, diminished the experience a bit. Off the fairways, things could get a little patchy/rocky. Some of the bunkers need sand - I fear they've overdone the number of bunkers and may not be keeping up with maintenance on those. While not important to the golf game itself, the cart paths were in pretty poor condition - you'll blow a tire in a few spots if you don't pay attention."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Had a great time and pace was good though we waited a few minutes on every hole in the back 9.Greens have been recently aerated which made putting difficult but understandable this time of the year.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Turned out to be a cold somewhat wet round. Even so, the greens were very fast and as usual, the course won. Cart paths have been improved some but in some cases unless you exit the proper side of a green you can spend a lot of time looking for the next tee."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Fun course to play, though conditions were very dry. Positioning on the greens are key and many greens are multi tiered and fast! I would play again if ever in the area."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"I played here for a charity outing. Course was a really fun challenge. Greens were in great shape, fairways looked good and I’m glad I didn’t visit when they had knee-high rough. Would definitely recommend getting some buddies together and seeing who will come out on top."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"This was my first time at this course. I was expecting a very difficult course. It was definitely challenging. The fairways and greens were in excellent condition. The roughs were a little dry. The greens were very fast, but fun to play, because they were very smooth and predictable. I was pleasantly surprised by my putting today. I do think this course has a little too many sand traps. 18 is ridiculous. Most of the traps were not very soft, and were more dirt and rock than sand."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,No GPS BUT WANNA CHARGE SOOOOO LUCH? SMHBATHROOMS DISGUSTING (pic). Best thing about this course was the female bartender. ALL ELSE FAILED EXPECTATIONS!!!!
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Purgatory is definitely deserving of the Top 10 public courses in Indiana hype. How high up is for you to decide but if you’re trying to play the best courses in the state you have to make the effort to visit here.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Lots of good holes and not in bad ones. If you’re hitting the bell well you’ll be rewarded and if not you shouldn’t be punished too severely. The 17th is definitely the signature hole and the par 3s are very good as a set, which is something which always sets a course apart from its peers."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Very nice course, good pace of play for a Thursday morning. One of the most challenging courses I’ve played in Indiana"
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,The course was in great shape and the greens were exceptional.. thanks to the grounds crew & keep up the good work.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"I can't wait to go back. Greens were perfect. Fairways were perfect. They mowed the heather down so it wasn't frustrating but the course still puts a premium on hitting the ball in play. If I had to find something wrong, many of the sandtraps were hard or had very little sand in them. For me, it's a bit expensive but I really enjoyed playing here."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"My wife and I had a wonderful time here. The course was certainly challenging, but fun at the same time. In fact, my wife shot her best front nine score ever on any course! The only issue was that there was a group of six in front of us that we quickly caught up to and there was no course marshall to address the issue. We had to wait several minutes on every hole before we could tee off and they did not let us play through. They did go in at the turn so the pace of play was dramatically better after that. Very much hope that we are out that way again to play another round or two there. Also, everyone working there were absolutely wonderful."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,Course was in good shape tee through greens. Sand traps were inconsistent. Staff was great. Tap water at the turn at no charge a plus. Not many courses do that up North.
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"Beautiful course. Challenging, but not not impossibly so. Every hole is well done. Only criticism I have is that many of the bunkers around the greens have shallow amounts of sand, which added strokes to my scorecard. Can’t go wrong playing this course."
Purgatory Golf Club,24894-purgatory-golf-club,"We were in the Indy Area for baseball and had one day to golf. We chose this course. We were very happy with our choice. The greens were great and the layout is fair but challenging. My only complaint is that the fairways were often too tight of a lie. In many places, being just off the fairway was more rewarded than being in the fairway. But overall, this was a good choice and we would play it again if given the chance."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Played on a warm December Sunday and enjoyed everything. Will be back!
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Looks like this may be my last round for 2024 at the Hick. I enjoyed it as always!
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Fun, Fun, Fun! Will be back!"
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,This course thinks way too much of itself. It’s a decent track but it’s not a resort course or a nice private course. The problem is…it thinks it’s that. They charge way too much for what you get. They staff is snobs…the course is set up too hard. The literally don’t want regular golfers to play here. So…don’t! You will have a much better time at one of the nearby courses for less money! Any of those courses is better than this place to.. Needless to say…I won’t go back.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Played here before their club championship and holy smokes were the greens fast!! Will be back
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Had a great time playing with a good group of guys! Lots of fun, great conditions, food, drinks, and friendly staff"
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Fairways and greens = ATee boxes = B-Carts - B+ (Would have given an A but the auto-shut down is annoying)Staff = APace of Play = APrice / Value = B+Overall = A-
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"We thought the tee boxes were a little rough, they'd just gotten a lot of play and needed moved."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Course was in awesome condition and the staff were amazing as always. Love playing here
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,First Time playing. Course was a lot of fun! Greens were very fast and fair. I love the links style layout. I will definitely play again!
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Overall, a good experience. Biggest controllable negative, goose droppings on greens and fairways. This should have been addressed, at least on the greens. Cart path only and being so early in the season probable played in a part in the slow pace of play. we were a foursome moving along pretty good. we have two foursomes in front of us, the lead of which was causing the tie up. No marshal on duty. Can't really complain about course condition. It's the beginning of February. With that in consideration, conditions were good. Young man in the pro shop was very nice and accommodating. Price seems high considering what season we are in."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"I've paid twice the price for courses that aren't half as good as this course. I had an amazing experience. Nothing negative to say about the course, staff, amenities, I immediately got a sense that this course is the center of the thriving local community."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"In anticipation of an upcoming event, I played this course from the tips. I am an 11.2 index so this was very challenging. The improvements that have been made and are continuing to be made make this an outstanding course to play in this area. We have many options around Hickory Stick but they have raised their game to the top!"
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"So apparently wearing a collared shirt is a thing for them, even though the shirt I was wearing DID have a collar. More like a TW shirt. Have worn it at multiple courses that require collared shirt. No big deal. Not enough though. So fine…$71 becomes $150 to buy a shirt that also did not have a collar but had their logo, so it was fine. At the turn they have no food except premade ham sandwich and they don’t even have mayo….so $150 plus food and can’t get mayo on a dry ham sandwich.Course was fine, not great but if you want something to eat, bring your own."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,extremely windy day which made this course super fun. Greens are in great condition and playing from the tips is the way to go.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Course was in great condition for so early in the season. Facilites and course conditions have improved significantly under new ownership.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"I make the drive to Hickory Stick at least a couple times a year because I enjoy the layout and the overall conditions are great for the price. My only complaint is that the greens usually have a lot of damage from unrepaired ball marks and the sheer amount of play they get. However, they are receptive and faster than average IMO."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Golf course was dry due to weather so despite no trees, course played difficult."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"This course is unreal, it’s in great condition my only minor complaint is the greens are beat up with ball marks. Other than that it’s great!!"
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Overall I would play here again but we did have a few issues. Biggest problem was the pace of play. We were stacked up 3-4 groups deep at times. They simply booked too many people or there was some sort of massive hold up. Either way it was not managed well. Next issue was I booked through golf now at 35 per person. At the course they charged me 40 per person. I didn't make a big deal about it but money is money. Lastly the options for food and snacks were not great, not a huge problem but pointing it out if you care. The course was fun, challenging at times and overall very well maintained. It does get a bit repetitive I thought but I guess that's part of the whole links style maybe? Would play here again but it wouldn't be my first choice."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Nice course design. Great challenging green complexes. Course in good condition for first day of spring. Challenging par 3's. Enjoyed a family day out on the course.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,This is my bad weather go to course. It’s always open. Drains well. Enough covered carts. Tough but fair play. Link style.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,This Irish links design is in perfect condition. Even after 2.5 days of heavy rain. This course drains very well. It was still cart path only but still pace of play was very steady. The greens were very fast which is what I personally like so if you like slow greens this is NOT the place for you. The fairways and greens both were in great shape. Hole layouts were very fun and challenging. It is a shorter course. We played the middle tees and it was 6500 yards.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,I have played this course 3 times now and never had a good experience. This course has gas carts but the USB’s actually charge the phone. The round was long and there was no ranger to keep pace going and no after round food.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Fast and fair greens.Very good layout.Long holes and short holes.All the trouble you need to avoid.Love it !
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Yes, it can get crowded (because so many people like it). Yes, when they plug the greens they have sand on them and don't put quite as well...DUH. Call ahead and check if you don't like that.The course is fair with decently wide fairways, and generally flat greens. Yes if you spray it all over you might loose a ball or two.This course is one of my only enjoyable links courses. I normally like tree lined courses. Much better condition and experience than the Legends in Franklin. Lots of character for a links course."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,fairways rolling and greens decent speed. highlands look featured and little water appeared to be applied to course. overall in fairly good shape.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Have played twice. Really enjoy this course layout. Fun and challenging. Great shape, friendly staff."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,madder than heck right now . booked a 230 tee time got to course @ 2 said i did'nt have a tee time ended up paying 58.00 again to play . pro shop just kept telling me i did not have a tee time as stated above i had a 230 tee time i paid you for somehow i lost 58.00 thank you golf now for not making mt tee time for 230
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Course overall condition is in great shapeEnjoyed the experienceSome bunkers excellent some need workBut overall not badRough is sparse of grass in some spotsGreens very good and speed very fair
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,I think one of the best on the southside. All the trouble is in the rough. Stay on the fairway and it’s fair all day long. Hope the secret doesn’t get out. I want to ply again.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Terrible experience. Unfriendly staff. No rain checks. Wasted a whole round because of rain
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Accuracy is a significant asset on this course due to numerous long bunkers that hug the fairways, water hazards, and unforgiving tall grass awaiting those with a strong draw or fade."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Tee boxes, fairways, and greens are very well kept. I found the bunkers twice in my round of 18 and both were hardened to this consistency of concrete. Very few trees on this course. Greens offered nice challenges, with complex breaks on longer putts."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"I'll admit I found the rolling nature of the course frustrating. Countless shots were made blind to my target, and the endless hills would block my view of the ball's final location. Perhaps some will like the challenge, but I didn't particularly care for it."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"The bigger frustration however, was the backlog at the tees, occasionally three groups deep, with lengthy wait times. I had read numerous other reviews before playing, seeing complaints about the pace - they weren't wrong. It took us over 5 hours for 18."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"All in all, not a terrible experience, but I personally didn't enjoy the roller-coaster aesthetic and the lengthy play time due to waiting around."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Have played Hickory Stick numerous times. Enjoy the layout as it provides a test for any golfer. It can be tough but is fair. The course was in good condition. On this day some of the staff could use a lesson in customer service and a smile. About half of the staff seemed grumpy and the other half were very friendly and helpful. No matter how your feeling on your work day you need to treat all customers with a smile and friendliness. Without customers you have no job. Be grumpy all you want till the customer shows up. Then it's all smiles and helpfulness. Just my 2 cents. Still like playing here and will return to play again.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Course was everything I like in a golf course. Challenging and yet playable. A lot of rolling fairways and greens. Great links style course and the Greens were very fast but yet every one was consistent so it was easy to adjust. Will play this course again.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Fairway grass was not fertilized and crabgrass was everywhere. I am use to this course being in better shape. Greens were cut very short, so putting was lime grass. The greens were hard which made it difficult to hold on an approach shot."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Course was in amazing condition, I’ll be going back soon to play the twilight hours in the near future."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,hickory stick is an awesome course. in my opinion i’ve played some good courses and paid $60 or $70 to play there and hickory stick has almost matched their conditions and for half the price. i will be coming back to play in the near future. definitely one of my favorite courses i’ve played all summer!
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,First time playing course. This course is fun with lots of grass mounds surrounding the fairways. Conditions were great despite lots of rain the preceding days. Pricing is a fantastic value. Will play here again on next visit to the area.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"The course was in good condition considering the recent weather. The tees were good condition, the greens were in good condition, and the fairways were a 6 on a scale or 1-10. There were two issues. 1) We had to wait about 20 minutes for a cart 2) the pace was extremely slow. We started about 2:00 PM (20 minutes late due to lack or cart, and we had long waits on every hole. It appears as though the course had set up tee times about every 8 minutes. We were not able to complete the course, and had to leave after 15 holes due to the slow pace."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"All they want to do is cram as many paying customers on this course as they can....and to bad for you if it takes 5 hours for your round. Never a ranger to keep play moving and lots of lousy, inconsiderate golfers. NEVER AGAIN!"
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"I suppose if the goal is to cram as many people as you possibly can regardless of the number in each group, and not even come close to monitoring pace of play, allowing 5somes, allowing 4 year olds to hit multiple balls off the tee box, then the folks at Hickory Stick succeeded magnificently. 5 1/2 hours to play a round of golf? Ridiculous."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Fairways are nicely kept, tricky hills and greens are fun. Tee boxes are really good. All around solid course"
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"It is truly like a Irish style links course, many angulations, and tricky greens."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"I've played here many times in the past, but this was my first round there this year. I have to say that we were very disappointed with the class, or lack of class, from the other players that have come to frequent the course. We luckily played through two groups that had never played golf before. But then were stuck behind a group for the remainder of the round that had clearly no business being on the golf course. Each player hitting two balls off of every tee, even as we sat there and watched it happen every time. We were verbally assaulted on multiple occasions for doing nothing except waiting for our turn to hit. Just a disgrace of a round that took over 5 hours to complete. The need for a ranger on the course to monitor play has never been more clear to us."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"So sure, we got a good on-line deal...$31.00 for weekend play. The course is really nice, challenging. But here was the problem: the pace of play was so ridiculously slow, it ruined the round. On hole #5, there were 5 groups! One group of slow old men about my age on the green, one group in the middle of the fairway, 3 groups on the tee box. This wasn't a par 3 either! I called the club house...""is there a ranger working today?""....""uh...I don't believe so"". No starter, no Ranger, no one working the snack bar. I think these owners need to quit worrying so much about shoving 300 rounds thru each day (7 min. starting intervals w/No starter) and focus on giving the golfer a pleasant experience. We jumped over 4 holes, and it still took 3 of us over 4 hours to complete 14 holes! I won't be back anytime soon, which is a shame...a very nice course (if people would fix their ball marks!)"
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Very nice conditions, an interesting links-style course. One of my new favorites in the area."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,We had a great time playing the course. Greens were true and fast Needed to teach members how to repair pitch marks. This course is too nice to not fix your on divot. Fairways were in fantastic shape.Rough is playable Layout is good
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Will play again if ever passing through.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Very nice course with challenging holes and amazing views.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Great condition but slow playWill return nice layout
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,The prices are good for the course difficulty and overall condition.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Nice course with large wide fairways and nice greens..fun to play..Highly recommended
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Great Course, greens in fantastic shape. Pace of play always a little slow, that just means golf is thriving."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,For all the play course in good condition. Tees need in some areas filled with sand / seed mix. Greens rolling 10.5 / 11 on stimp . Driving range plus practice green good warm up area. Love having club cleaning station on range.Compliment Mr Kerr who greeted after round at cart return asking how we enjoyed facilities and thanked us for coming to Hickory Stick..
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Course is in a subdivision but houses distanced so not much of a factor when playing. Fun course with challenges. Exceptional value for the course. Will definitely play again when in the area.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Try to play this course once a year and it never dissapoints! Staff is always friendly and it's a fun place to play.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"I've played Hickory countless times and it is always a great play for the price. I've shot everything from a 76 to an 88 here due to the course lulling you into a false sense of security based on a few ""easy"" holes. Depending on where the flags are and the wind strength the day you play, it can can feel MUCH longer than what it is. Course was in great condition and even with the COVID-19 precautions in place the staff were still friendly and helpful. I'll be back soon."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Golf course is greening up, greens were a little slow for my liking but not too slow. Bunkers haven't been worked but its April and everything going on its fine. Fairways were good, tee boxes good. No complaints."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Came up to visit family and decided to play Hickory Stick. It had been many years since I played this course but liked the layout. The course did not disappoint me, it’s a link style course so you are penalized if you are not in the fairway. The tee boxes were in good shape, and the greens were fast as I remember them."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"My advice to anyone playing this course, is to see what the pin placement is, and shoot for below the hole. You do not want to be putting from above the hole if possible. I will definitely play this course again when I come back to visit."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Good course. Pace of play was a struggle but it was a Sunday. Nobody repairs their pitch mark's which is sad. Putts can be bumpy. Wayward shots can be lost. The uneven lies require some focus. All in all, I would go back."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,The course seemed to be overbooked.They didnt have a starter. We started 20min late and had to wait at every tee.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,I play here all the time and have never been disappointed. Great course in great condition.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,We enjoyed our game. We walked the course and it was very enjoyable. We will go there again.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Course in good shape overallPace of play was terrible, no rangerOn third tee box 3 foursomes and foursome in fairwayNever had any separation 5 1/2 round"
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Pace of play was a bit slower than what I expected but was still able to get round finished in 4 hours. Fairways and greens were in excellent shape
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,For March it was fantastic. Staff couldn’t have been nicer. Will definitely be back soon! Pace of play could’ve been a little better but we will chalk it up to the fair weather golfers getting there first swings in.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Ugh very windy day and greens obviously not normal after being aerated this week. Enjoy the layout and played very quick today.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Well maintained tee boxes and greens and a wonderful layout. Practice facility is also well done.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,The golf now price was ridiculously cheap. And the course was well worth paying double the price. Would highly recommend
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Hickory Stick has an interesting layout, that has a lot of bumps and undulations throughout the course. It's in solid shape for September, and the greens looked/rolled really smooth. Very firm today with the recent lack of rain, and the South wind made it feel like 3/4 of the holes were into the wind."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"But... They really messed up today. They had an outing that shotgunned, and arrived with more people than planned. So they were backed up and sent us (and others before us) out to 14 to start, and said it'd be smooth sailing from there until we hit the back of the outing. Ok, no problem. Actually... HUGE problem. Someone did not relay the info that we started where we did to the starter and we wound up turning from 18 to 1 into a few groups. After the starter asked us why we did what we did and was puzzled, he decided to wave us in front of others that hadn't started, and paired us with 2 that were waiting. By the 3rd hole we were 4 groups deep on the tee box, and it took roughly 90 minutes to play holes 1-5 after taking less than 40 to play 14-18. It opened up some once the outing started to finish and we passed a slow group. But still, no excuse for this poor tee sheet/outing management. Makes me somewhat hesitant to return."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"It’s been 5+ years since I last played Hickory Stick, and it’s still the same challenging links type Course I remember. Conditions were fantastic and pace of play was great. The staff were terrific, even accommodating with a replay round at no charge. Great mix of holes that makes you think your way around the course, not just grip it and rip it."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,The course was well kept and has a good layout with thick rough to make it interesting if you miss the fairways. The greens have good layouts and make you think about every putt. The bunkers are very average.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Played there on the second day of a short trip to Indianapolis. Surprised it wasn’t more crowded on a Sunday afternoon as I was able to walk on and get a time. The course seems like it is out of the way and pretty far off the highway. I wasn’t exactly sure where I was going, even after looking at my GPS."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"After checking in, had trouble finding the first tee. Got my cart and drove over to what I thought was the opener but that was actually the 10th tee. Took me a little time to figure out that the first tee box was across the street at the far end of the parking lot. I did not see a sign stating where the first tee actually was located."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"The course was in solid shape. The fairways were in good condition but had some brown patches, probably due to the summer heat. The greens seemed a little small but they did have a bit of elevation changes. However, they rolled well and helped me make a few putts that day. Many of the greens are up on hills but you could still run a ball up onto them. Lakes come into play on half the holes. The rough was pretty thick and had some high grass/native brush on the edges."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Many of the holes seemed to play a little short but that might have been due to the slightly dry conditions helping the ball run out. I’m not a big hitter off the tee at all but came pretty close to the green on both the first and seventh holes. Nine played in an odd direction to me and I wasn’t quite sure where I was supposed to aim my second shot. The 12th fairway was narrow but had a huge amount of rough to the left that was playable out of. The par-5 16th hole had some homeowners hanging out on their back patios watching the golfers.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"It is a good and strong course worth playing but not sure I would play there again on my next trip to Indy, simply due to its location."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Played this course on the second day of back-to-back rounds in Indianapolis. On a good weather day, I thought it would be packed. However, I was pleasantly surprised to find it wide open. I think it might be an out-of-the-way course that is difficult to get to. I wasn’t sure where I was going, even on my GPS!"
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,The course itself was in very good condition. The fairways had a few brown patches but the greens were in excellent shape. I’m not a long hitter at all but I got a lucky bounce and nearly drove the green on No. 3 and also nearly got onto the front on No. 7. It might have been the dry conditions but I got a lot of roll. The par-5 16th hole was very nice and had houseowners hanging out and watching on their back patios!
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Over the entire round, I think I saw a couple of singles and around four two-somes but that was about it. Great for pace of play! Booked a twilight time for $30 and it was an excellent value."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"One complaint was that I had trouble finding the first tee, though. I thought I had found it, as it was the closest tee box to the clubhouse, but instead it was the 10th hole. After a bit of looking, I realized the first tee box was across the street at the end of the parking lot."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"When I visit Indianapolis, I’m usually downtown, so this was a bit of a voyage to get to. It is a strong course but probably just too far out of the way for me to ever play again."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"First off, this course was a great challenge and in wonderful condition! This is definitely what would bring me back. The individual working the front desk, however, really needs to work on service and overall friendliness. I was never greeted by the individual and a word was never said to me until I told him when my tee time was. I was then given a cart key and receipt and he began walking away. I had to ask where the carts were, he then pointed and asked if it was my first time visiting. After responding that it was my first time, he nodded and walked away. Very disappointed. This was compounded by the lack of signage directing to the first tee... especially when the staff doesn’t bother to explain the course layout when they find out you are a first time visitor. Once again though. Great course design and fantastic conditions"
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Like this course alway in good playing condition injoy the layout greens in great shape I will play again
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Hickory stick is the premiere course on the south side on Indianapolis. I have played it twice now, and I keep wanting more. The course is an ""Irish Links"" style course in a very nice housing community. The location is a bit remote which I believe is the main reason it doesn't get more praise around town. The greens are mid sized with a good amount of undulation. I feel like it plays a little shorter than the stated yardage, so i will move back another set of tees the next time around. The 11 hole seems to be in need of some repair as the bunker up next to the green is completely washed. It was like this last fall when i played it last. This would be my only gripe about the course."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"I love the collection areas around the greens, and i really enjoy the variety of holes. 16 is one of my favorite holes in town and the perfect par 5! I may call this course home next season."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"great layout, and friendly stafftremendous shape, especially after ALL of the recent weather conditions"
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,would come back!
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Love this course!Only negative on this date was that the first 4-5 greens had narrow bare tracks carved into them by an obviously bad green mower. It seemed to interfere with some puts for sure. I’m certain it will repair over a week or two.Regardless, I suggest this course to all my friends!"
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Usually this course is great. The greens were garbage. Just aerated and the first 5 had big stripes across the greens every 2-3’ which made putting atrocious. The rest of the greens had sand all over them and were just dirty and hard to putt. Save your money and try this. Purse later this year.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,A friend of mine and I booked this course via the golf now app for $42 a piece to play 18 holes yesterday. I drove 35 minutes to get there while my friend drove 90 minutes. After arriving at 8:15am we were told by staff that we could only play on the back 9 holes due to the first 4 holes on the front being aerated. Staff member then told us to check back with him after we golf the back 9 as there might be a chance we could golf the front 9. After checking back in after 9 holes we were told that last week one of the mowers leaked hydraulic fluid all over the first 4 holes and we would have to play the back 9 again. By this time the parking lot was 3/4 full and there was a line of 8 people waiting to start on hole 10. So we left and played Valle Vista.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,We will never golf this course again. I feel the staff was very unprofessional and disrespectful by not letting us know ahead of time of the issues and that we might only be able to play the back 9. My friend drove a long way to meet me there to play. Obviously they just wanted our $84. At the very least they could have offered us half of our money back.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"I live in southern Indiana and have played Hickory Stick about 4-6 times past couple of years with the recent one being in April 2019. I have never found fairways and greens on this course in bad shape, it’s always flawless and challenging. Greens are some of the best greens in the area."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Improvement ideas - #2 is a odd hole with no character just a straight up par 4.#5 is way too long for a par 4, this hole is already extremely tough due to the long bunker on the left and the elevated green.Bunkers on the course need some serious repairing, they have been in pretty bad shape now for over a year."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"I would have rated this course a 5 star if bunkers were all operational, I would still play this course again soon because of the challenge and beauty it is!"
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Excellent layout and very nice conditions for March golf. I imagine it’s absolutely awesome to play in the summer. I’m pretty picky when it comes to golf courses but this is one of my favorites in in greater Indianapolis area. My group from Grand Rapids MI will be back! Only downfall was poorly marked tee boxes and yardage on course.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Hickory Stick is the best course I've played so far on the South side of Indy. A good test of shotmaking with smaller greens, most of which are undulating. Miss them and you're likely in a shaved chipping area below the green. Course was in good shape for March. It was a little confusing to find #1 at first with no signs out yet on the course, But overall it was a solid, interesting mix of holes, knobs, and elevation change. I'll be back again."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,The course was in good condition except for the first couple of greens that had been re-sodded recently . Should have called the course directly for the tee time and saved the Golfnow fee .
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Course is in great shape. Fun and challenging as well
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"The layout is incredible! I loved the way this course was set up, and I will make it a regular course in my rotation. This is the best course on the south side of town and probably top 10 or top 15 in the entire city."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"It is a links style course with well placed water hazards, picturesque holes and deep bunkers. The greens were in fantastic shape and very quick. The fairways also have lots of elevation changes, so it is not only important to be in the fairway but to be on the correct side of the fairway if you want a flat approach shot. The rough is very thick and will eat balls it you are not on point."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"The course was very wet after the recent rain we had, so I cannot give an honest assessment of the bunkers. I assume that this course plays hard and fast during mid summer conditions and that the wind can really get blowing out on the course. The course also has lots of collection areas around the greens which is not something seen very often around here. It is a Tim Liddy course, and it reminds me a lot of trophy club."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Got a decent deal on GolfNow and the weather looked to be sparing the southside, so we played Friday at 2. Weather was kinda rolling in short waves of spitting rain on the front. Rain gear off and on."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Course was in solid shape; tees, fairways, closest rough all grassed well. This course has always drained well, so the recent spat of rain we've had in central IN hasn't swamped this place. Bunker were ok, obviously with rain they hadn't been treated, but played fair. The greens were really in great shape, smooth and pretty quick/consistent. This course has always had some pretty sketchy looking crabgrass in the out-of-the-way areas, so if you spray the ball, don't count on your lie being very good. (I'm ok with this - golf isn't about perfect lies all day). I do think they're letting a few more areas go to tall fescue, low/no maintenance areas and I think that's a great ideal; save on maintenance cost. But you will lose a ball in there."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"I think they blend holes well together out here: some short, some long. There are a few tee shots that favor draws, some a cut. Starting with a fairly flat piece of land, they've created some mounding and some fall-off areas. I've always found that if you tee ball is going where you're aiming out here, you can score."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"I like how #1 starts off with a scoring opp if you hit the green in reg; if you miss, good luck. #3 is an Alps-like hole, which is always a little fun. #5 can be a demanding hole any day of the week, starting with the tee ball - can you hit the fairway?"
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Today I did get treated (abused?) by something I'll probably never see in person again: my partner aced #4 from 191yds, then followed that up by peeling off 4 more birdies in a row! I was up 2up on him at the 4th tee and by the time we reached #9, I was down nine shots! Incredible. He's still smiling."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"The weather got tropical and windier on the back and we were leaking some oil coming in. I managed to get focused and actually played better than the front. I think the finishing holes here are a real test: Par 5 sixteenth requires 3 good shots for most, the par 3 seventeenth is long, tough and the par 4 eighteenth dares you to take on the aggressive line off the tee. This stretch can trash your round, especially if the wind is in (and it usually is)."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,This place is always pretty solid and I like playing here a few times a year. They have minimal trees and in the fall this a favorite.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"I've probably played 20-30 courses between central and southern Indiana and this one ranks number 1! I normally play courses that range from $30-$60 to give you an idea... This course for 18 holes and a cart thru GolfNow only cost us $27, but I would gladly pay $50. The course is challenging, but not so difficult you'll pull your hair out. I don't recommend playing when its above 90 degrees, sunny, and humid, as there is little shade. The staff didn't seem very friendly, but they were not rude either, however, I think that may have been due to the fact they had minimal staff on hand. The greens and fairways were the best I've played all year! The only complaint I have about the course itself is that half the bunkers were like concrete. They also had tablets equipped in the cart that range, scorecard, hole layout that even had the pin locations spot on! Overall this is my new favorite course for the money! Hope this review helps!"
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"I'm very disappointed in this course. I'm not going to pay $50 again to play this course in the current condition. What a rip off. This is my favorite course on the south side of Indianapolis. I've played this course for more than 10 years, and the condition this course is in is embarrassing. The fairways are long, usually very thin and smooth, and they are patchy all over the course. Rough and heather were in usual condition and overall were fine. Many bunkers are gone or just poorly managed and not full. Greens were long and slow when they are normally very short and super quick this time of year. Course played super long because of the length of the fairways. Hopefully this course fixes whatever the issues are right now with keeping up the standard it had for the last 10 years. Shot 39-40 for an eight-over, 79 from the green tees (second longest option)."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"The course was in excellent condition. Really enjoyed the layout, not too challenging but enough trouble to get into if you hit a bad shot."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,First time playing at Hickory Stick. Great course and facilities!
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Course was in great shape. I recommend playing the green tees - just a little further back. But, it seems to take some trouble out of play. We paid for the $15 replay and played 2 rounds it was so nice out. Love this course."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Played the course for the first time and found it very nice. It played shorter than the tees indicated but was still very enjoyable. It def rewards good shots & rejects bad ones (quickly). We liked the run off/catch basin areas around the greens (don't have that where we typically play). We also liked the subtle bends to the fairways-- not many straight holes. A few holes are hard to figure out the best way to play since it was our first time (#9).All in all-- if we are in the area we will play again.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Fairways decent, greens medium quick. Did have difficulty locating any balls in rough. Overall good experience"
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,This used to be a nice course. The maintenance has gotten very poor. The bunkers are awful. The grass is not cut often enough. The greens are to fast for the size and shape.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Overall...this is a $20 course now. At $40 regular price and $30 twilight there are better places to play.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Keep it in the fairway and you'll be fine. The rough, however, is another story. If you find yourself in the thick rough, best to just get the ball back in play. Don't try to be a hero. Greens were excellent and the ball did what you asked it to do. Bunkers are in bad shape due to recent flooding, so if you find yourself in a bad one, take a drop."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"It’s the one course I would consider getting a membership at. I prefer to play different courses throughout the summer. But, if I were to pay for a membership somewhere. This would be the place. It’s just the perfect challenge. Par 3’s are great. Back is a little tougher than the front.My 1 suggestion would be to stretch the 5th hole tee box back 50yards and make it a par 5. Making it a par 72"
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,I’ve played Hickory Stick several times and it never disappoints. The course is always in fantastic condition; the staff is always helpful and friendly. I would recommmend Hickory Stick to anyone without hesitation.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Bunkers are gone need some work, greens for 1/27 where in great shape, fairways hold water but playable in most areas, cart were on paths but expected from rain prior day"
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"This is a really good golf course unless you like trees. Open, generally windy with large undulating greens that will test your putting as well as chips to. The fairways are generally wide and accessible with fairway bunkers that resemble those on an Irish Links. Even in January the greens were reasonably quick. And added bonus, its fairly easy to find a wayward shot here and there isn't a lot of heavy vegetation just off the fairways. Recommend this to you. The 3 finishing holes provide a stern test with plenty of water."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,The course was in less than ideal condition . Fairways were wet and greens were just aerated. I've played here several times and this was by far the worst .
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"I made tee times for 16 guys which I had done on other occasions at this course. When we get there they tell us that they had just aerated the greens on the front and were going to do the the back that day. Because of this the back was closed. Well trying a course that would take 16 people on a moments notice was not an option. We decided to play the front twice. The greens had been punched but the sand was laying around in piles. Needless to say, paying full senior rates for a piece of crap like this was the last straw. On top of that they never started aerating the back nine because they didn't have enough help show up. Will schedule our golf group there again. We will take our 450 to 500 dollars elsewhere."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"I played out at Hickory Stick on Sunday, September 3rd. Hickory Stick has always been one of my favorite courses to play. The layout is great and the greens always seems to be in great shape. My biggest problem with the course are the bunkers. I've never seen bunkers like this before at a course that is charging $50 to play. No sand whatsoever. Fairways and greens were still in great shape except for a few little spots, but I expect that this time of year. No issues with that at all. It was still a great day of golf. I will still go back and play there. I hope they plan on fixing the bunkers for next season."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Hickory Stick is one of my favorite courses to play in Southern Indiana. I chose to play the tips this time around, which makes it a completely different course. I have never played this course and been disappointed. The clubhouse staff isn't always the friendliest to those that aren't regulars or members, but the course makes up for that. I HIGHLY recommend Hickory Stick to golfers of all ages and abilities. They offer 4 different sets of tee boxes to accommodate all skill levels. Enjoy!"
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,The course looked spectacular upon arrival. The area was very dry and so was the course. We were held up at number 10 for about 20 minutes. I would love to go play it again when the area has received some rain
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Great course. Staff was overly accommodating. Most courses in area were reduced to cart path only due to rain issues all week. This course drains extremely well. They were able to accommodate our group of 16 at the last minute. Fantastic course and outstanding professional staff. We will be back again next time we are in the Indy area. Hidden gem as it does not get the same publicity as courses on the northside of Indy.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"My round at Hickory was awesome. One of my favorite courses to play in the city. I shot a 67, the course was in great shape. not wet at all. drains really well. If you have a chance to play definitely do!"
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"I just can't brag enough on this course. The whole place is beautiful, and they do a great job keeping it up. I have played courses all over Indiana and Hickory Stick is definitely top 3 on my list. Great value for a Golf Now deal."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Great shape for middle of October! Fast play! Staff friendly!
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"First time we played this course and would go back in a minute. Great course, loved the links style and the various challenges throughout. Only one 'bathroom' on course and it was on the back nine which is bummer, but definitely the only drawback."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,The course was a very good value but the guy at the desk gave me a bad time about the fact that I forgot my reservation number. Why?
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Course was in excellent condition. Greens were lightning fast fairways were firm. Difficult to hold shots into the green Needed to run your shots up onto the greens. I will definitely return to play again
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"This is an excellent course with varying challenges. While the fairways are wide open and it's a challenge in itself to lose a golf ball, the traps and greens test your will (and your talent). Clever hazard locations and smaller than average greens make for difficult iron shots, and a challenging green will test your putting skills, but overall the course doesn't leave you feeling in over your head. This course is in great condition, and is maintained very well, but you certainly pay for it. Would definitely go again, but likely not for awhile."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Great course that was in great condition. We'll go back.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"We played as a foursome and although only novice golfers, we played at a pretty good pace. However, the foursome in front of us was extremely slow. At times they would spend upwards of 10 mins looking for their lost balls."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Played on a Friday afternoon. Pace of play was very good. Greens were in excellent condition
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Course was in fairly good shape. Greens were in great shape. Only negative would be that course probably had too much watering and several fairways were too wet and it appeared that carts had gotten stuck in several places. Would prefer that the areas just short of the green would not be so damp. Otherwise, course in good shape for August."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,A great course on Indy's Southside -- very challenging greens and huge fairways. Try to get one of the daily HOT DEAL tee times and you'll save big. Not sure if I would pay full price for this course ($49) when you can play twilight for $30 starting at 3 every day.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Really a nice course. There are only a couple holes that i would classify as boring. Each has its own personality.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"The GPS on the cart shows distances to front, back, and middle, as well as landmarks such as bunkers."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,The rolling fairways give lies you don't always get and tightly mown areas greenside will funnel some shots off and well away from the target.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,The huge mounds throughout add a lot of character to a well manicured course.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,One of the best courses in the Indianapolis/Greenwood area without a doubt. We will certainly be back.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Great course...Great deal on the price. Any golfer in the area should go play Hickory Stick!
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"The fairways and greens were in excellent condition. Most fairways are somewhat narrow but the rough was not too deep, unless you were in or behind one of the several mounds that dotted the course. Played from the senior tees and the course is fairly short from there. Mostly used the driver and a sand wedge to reach the greens. Probably should have moved back a tee to make the course more of a challenge. But I'm 68 and was nice to not have to draw out the medium irons for a change."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Course was in excellent condition. Best greens I have been on this year! Challenges on every hole make it a true test of complete game. Wish it was closer to Bloomington.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,I've played Hickory Stick about 3 times now and it is in good condition every time with this last round being no different. Greens were great and fairways were good to just a couple minimal rough spots. Course is challenging if you aren't hitting it straight almost always setting up a shot in the sand or with a tough lie on a dune. The course has a fun layout and well worth a play.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"course and facilities where in great shape. I try to play this course a couple times of year, been playing it for about 7 years. Never disappointed. Wife plays and she loves the course as well. A great test of golf for all levels. One of my favorite course in Indiana"
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Course doesn't drain well even after significant time to dry out. Cart path only conditions makes one second guess playing at all due to long distances from path to lies, undulating terrain makes it difficult to judge distances from cart etc. Found myself carrying multiple clubs, towel, GPS, etc nearly every shot on every hold. In hindsight walking (push cart) would have been much better bet. Only other concern was that greens were just pummeled by outing earlier that same day. Otherwise course in phenomenal shape as usual, one of my favorites, especially tee boxes and fairways."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Very nice course. Course can be tough if you dont hit it straight. The fairways are nice. The rough off the fairway is thick (though not unreasonable) and the grass on the mounds is very high. Greens were great. A fair number of pitch marks, but most of them looked as if the player tried to repair them. Overall, the greens were well above averge for a public course."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Back 9 has a cool layout with some longer holes. 16 was my favorite. Dog leg left with a pond running the whole left side with mounds and bunkers on the right.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"If I were to find faults, I would say they need to take better care of the bunkers. Some were rocky. My advice to the course would be to purchase some better sand. It seriously would make a huge difference. Also, a cart person with drinks and snacks driving around would be convenient."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Again, nice course, true identity, good shape, must play."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Great course if you are preparing for the US Open! Rough just off the fairway ranged from 3 to 6 inches. Took the driver out of play. Lost two balls that rolled through the fairway just a couple of feet. Great test of golf, but probably unplayable for the average golfer."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,The course was in very good shape. The rough a bit too deep. Bunkers need raking
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,This course has a a great layout and right at 6000 yrds from the white tees. Greens were in good condition. The GPS in the carts is a big help as well.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Course conditions were nice, bunkers were hit and miss as far as playability."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Hickory Stick is a great course for people of all skill levels to test their accuracy by offering many fairway bunkers and multi-level greens.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"After the rough winter I was finally able to play my first round, the course is a place I'd surely play again. Most of the fairway and rough were still pretty dormant but greens had good color and were maintained. Course offers a good challenge, not many hazards but shots will be tested based on the slight changes in elevation and various shot angles due to the dunes. Nice layout and with a hot deal well worth the play."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"This course is a very forgiving course. The course was very well kept. I didn't like the fact that the greens keepers had mowed and there was a lot of grass clippings through the fairways and up around the greens, but it had minimal effect on my round. There were a few spots near the greens where the drainage had created some very wet spots and the mowers had really tore it up as well. With the slope of some of the fairways it was forgiving that the ball would collect towards the center of the fairway, provided you could hit it there. This was a very fast course, the greens were slick as ice so make sure that you hit some putts on the putting green."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,I really liked this course. The fairways undulated and were in great shape. I loved the layout and the look to the holes. My only problem was that they had recently aerated the greens so they were stilled filled with millions of tiny holes. Other than that I would recommend this course to anyone who asks about it.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"I am new to the Indianapolis area, so I went to play this course based on the reviews. This is an average course in average condition. Based on the reviews, I expected much more from this course than was delivered. I used the 'hot deal' and only paid $25, which is all the course is worth and that is questionable. Don't be fooled by the reviews, nothing special here.BTW, here's a clue for this course, how about some signs. There are no street signs leading to the clubhouse and NO SIGNS directing you to #1 or #10. I was given a cart key and told to tee off on #10. Nothing directing you to #10 or #1. Really idiotic."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Course is well maintained. Played there in Feb, May and Sept. was enjoyable each time staff remembered me, welcome me back. Quite surprised. Normally i prefer playing on a course away from residential neighborhood. Could disregard that factor for this course since it is very well maintained and enjoy the link style course. Definitely different feel than some of the typical Indiana courses."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Why need directions and signs when there is 13inch GPS guide on the cart? I didn' have trouble finding the ways around the course. Disagree with the comment below.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"The course was in very good condition for this time of the year. The front office was excellent and friendly. Greens were in nice condition, with spin on shorter shots."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,The course was in excellent conditions considering the very hot weather and little rain we have had lately. Staff is great and very friendly. I think I have found my new favorite course!
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Great course, paid a great fee for it too! If they can afford to have people play at this rate, then why is their normal rate so ridiculously high...golf prices have gotten out of hand everywhere in Indiana lately. There are a few exceptions to that last generalization."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,I love the course and when you get a deal on fees its a great value
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Tee shots looks more intimadating than they are. Small, but nice rolling greens. Overall, good time."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"The course was very wet due to heavy rains this week, but was still in good playing condition."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Good variation and layout. Challenging holes and beautiful surroundings. Course was in excellent condition
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"As most courses, bunkers could use some attention, tall weeds need sprayed on edges of bunkers ,but greens and fairways in good shape. GPS is great help to speed play."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Accuracy is more important than length at Hickory Stick. If the ball is in the fairway, the approach shots are not too difficult, but sand, rough, and other hazards make recoveries difficult. The greens are in good shape. The carts are equipped with GPS monitors, taking the guesswork out of clubbing."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"It was a little wet, cloudy, cool and it rained briefly. The course and staff were excellent. In my top 5 of courses in this area."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Course was in good shape,. Very firm and fast for early in year. Very windy, so course played like a links, which is how it was designed. Greens were hard, but showed ball mark dead spots because grass isn't growing well yet"
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,First time playing this course and you can tell it is a Tim Liddy design. It feels like a blind of Trophy Club and Heartland Crossing combined. Greens a small for this size course. The par 3's and par 5's is where the difficulty is. The par 4's average just under 400 yards from the tips. I enjoyed the round and will be back for more! your middle to short iron game has to be sharp if you plan to score on this track...
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"This course is a challenging course, but provides opportunities to for birdies and eagles. Has two drivable par 4's with risk and reward. This course will reward good drives, and punish those who struggle finding the fairway! Will recommend this course for anyone looking for a fun and challenging course. The course is beautiful and also has firm greens and undulated greens. Great course!"
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,Once again a great experience on the course and in the clubhouse. I'll definitely play there again in the spring.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"Well manicured course, greens run true but slick. Played the forward tees so played much easier than from the whites. Saved $3.50 per person on golfnow vs. the daily senior rate. Bigger savings for non seniors."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,"This course is typically one of my favorites to get to each summer. Having played several different courses this year, i can say about all of them suffered from the extreme heat and dry conditions. This course however, seemed to be hurt the more so than others. Tee boxes were in bad shape and alot of the fairways had grass areas that were checked out. Greens still had quick pace. Staff was pleasant as usual. We were also behind a group or two that were slower than most (My foursome waited on every tee box for the threesome in front of us)."
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,This course has a very friendly staff and is very fun to play. Always in great condition.
Hickory Stick Golf Club,25452-hickory-stick-golf-club,A little on the short side but still a fun place to play
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Greens were nice. Sand was not. Poor sand all over the course.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Everything was good except thr bunkers they were rock hard
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Really enjoy this place...wish it was closer to my home.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"We really liked it, fairways and greens were VERY NICE. Didnt care for the rocks in the sand traps, but that hardly was an issue."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Thanks!
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Good golf course. The course is too difficult for players above about a 12 handicap and most play from tees that are too challenging for them. Consequently that leads to excruciating slow play. The staff needs to set pace of play rules and enforce them. 5 hour rounds (even on weekends) are not acceptable to me.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,the high winds created slick and challenging greens!
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"I've always enjoyed playing The Trophy Club. The layout is challenging but fun to play. Very much a links course with ponds and stream coming into play on half the course. Easy to get to in Lebanon, Indiana next to I-65."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Big greens with a ton of contour. Challenging layout. This course is dynamite!
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,This course is always well maintained. Worth the drive regardless of what side of town you live on.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,I went with reviews online to play here and it was overpriced for the way it looked
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Nice course, had some water damage. Overall fun and challenging course. Did run into a group that tee off about an hour before I did and were playing slow which was not fun but did manage to get done with the round."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,greens were rolling nicely as well as fairways. only drawback are bunkersplayed in 3 hr15 minutes.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"The clubhouse and staff were nice. The course was okay. Both the greens and fairways were really fast. The bunkers were dirt, mud, or water.It’s certainly not worth the over $50 per player I paid for."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"A lot of people play this course so if you want to speed golf, this course gets plenty of traffic. Regardless, this is a beautiful course, that provides an ideal measure of your difficulty."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Great course, great value. Love the staff. And they upgraded beer and food!"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Sand bunkers were all very wet and hard as a rock. Unplayable. Other than that, loved the layout and rest of the course was in really good shape"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Really enjoyed this layout. Super long drive for me to play more than once a year but it was worth checking out and I’ll definitely be back. The fairways are big but the greens are fast/undulating and missing the green makes for a tough up and down, so it was plenty challenging. Tee boxes/fairways/greens were pure. There were a couple bunkers that looked like they were going back to “wildlife areas”, not sure what that’s about. Also a drainage issue by #6 green. My only true complaint is that the pace of play (4:45 hours) was gross for a late Thursday morning tee time."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Great links style track. Very fun layout, greens were in excellent condition. It just rained the day before so there was a lot of standing water in the bunkers but everything else was in great shape. Played on a Tuesday morning and no one else was out. Will definitely go again."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Playing surfaces good for time of year. Bunkers awful. Formally a great track. Now not so much. Carts are below average. Had to get someone from the pro shop to help me get something to drink after the round. At least they had a starter that was helpful. Wetland area where there shouldn’t be one right of six green!
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Trophy Club is one of my favorite courses in the Indianapolis area. It's in solid shape to start 2023. The sand has always been the biggest problem there but it is slowly improving. Everything else from tee to green was great. If you play it on a day with no wind, thank the deity of your choice as it's usually windy there even when it's not. Well worth the trip to play, especially if traveling between Chicago/Indy on I-65."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Great staff, great course, great value, worth the drive."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,It reminded me of purgatory but a slightly easier track. Despite the openness there is still some strategy behind shots. Wind was strong but didn’t do much to the ball flight. Clubhouse was nice and checkin was fast! Just would have liked the concessions after 11 to be open.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Early in the season grounds could be worked on but I’m sure it’s expensive to maintain the details. Some of the green side bunkers could use a major overhaul. But all in all for location it’s fair.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"I played a day with 150+ tee times scheduledA nice amount to be prepared forMy time was around 11 am I arrived approximately 10amThe range was closed until 11:30 ( mowing)I drove over an hour to play and enjoy being able to warm up. So, I walked around and putted.When I asked if it was possible to hit wedges(Mower was snot 200+ yards out) I was told no"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"The course had no yardage books availableOnly an outdated laminated flip card, in the cart, which was falling apart.The course was in good conditions. With greens that are very undulated A green guide ,for purchase like GolfLogix, would’ve made my round enjoyable"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Staff was kind to usual members. And dismissive to new ones.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"I have always enjoyed playing this course with friends while in the Indy area. Unfortunately, course conditions have gone way downhill since last visit a few years ago. Rough is just weeds and bunkers are unplayable. Greens are firm but fine. #6 seems to have a water issue with flooding all around the green even though it has been dry. Before, course was a great value. Now course is overpriced. I love the layout and course can be scorable or difficult when wind is in your face. It saddens us to see the decline. Probably won't make it back any time soon, though I will miss the layout."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Trophy club remains a fun layout and nice routing, HOWEVER….. it looks like the place is under new ownership and about to go under.Bunkers are COMPLETELY unplayable and not maintained by grounds crew. Weeds everywhere and fairways had not been mown. Greens were VERY slow…. Probably hadn’t been cut/rolled. I get the concession stand not being open, but the bathrooms were NOT open either. Place is open for business but NOT being maintained. IF you have come to expect an upscale experience here, you will be disappointed at present time.There are also serious drainage issues. # 6 green and surrounds are almost completely under water"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Used to be a great course. Now most of the traps are garbage.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Overall course was great and staff have great.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,My one complaint/disappointment - the staff and every know when the first tee time of the day is. The fact that half on the back 9 did not have pins in the holes is frustrating. I was the first tee time of the day…. At 10am! There was no one in front of us. They put hole ones flag in as we were hitting our second shot. 2 through 9 all were fine. I would venture to say that 10-18 … 6 maybe 7 flags were either laying on the green or off to the side.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Just disappointed.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Recommend not playing this golf course unless you can't get a tee time elsewhere. They schedule 8 min tee times and no starter/player assistant. We had to wait for 25 mins to tee off, past our tee time. Sand bunkers have been in poor condition for the past three years. The guy in the pro shop stated, due to lack of budget, the bunkers will not be fixed (pics attached). It is a great course if management invested to fix the bunkers and managed pace of play."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Expectations are not high for the condition of the course when you are playing in mid-February in central Indiana. That being said, the course was in better condition than I would have ever expected. Greens were pretty slow (as one would expect), but they were in great condition. Fairways were weren't exactly firm, but not sloppy except in just a few isolated low areas. Well done to the staff out there."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,The course was in absolutely flawless condition. I've played a bunch of nice courses in the last few weeks and this one by far in the best condition. I will love to play this course over and over again
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Had a great time playing here. Plays like a higher end course but for a more manageable price tag. Highly recommend and will be back.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Tee off 12:48 and ended close to 6:00. They allowed a member foursome to jump in coming off 18 to 1. Waited 5-10 minutes each tee. Misesrsble. Not worth the money on Saturday round.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"The course architecture and UN developed surrounding location make it a nice spot to getaway and golf away from Indy. Awesome views on every hole. At the time I played most traps need some tlc. Maybe some additional attention to fairways etc. overall not bad, greens were nice and fast. Had a fun time and will come back."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"This course is a gem of a track. 30 min north of Indy. Challenging, but not ridiculous. The carts have a. laminated book that tells you how to play each hole. I used it multiple times.I will go back for sure."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Best value around Indy. Need to open the bathrooms on the course though
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Course has a great layout, and is challenging for all levels of players. Overcrowded, was waiting 5-10 minutes between shots due to the amount of traffic. Called clubhouse to ask if they could notify the foursomes to let me as a solo play through, was told to deal with it because everyone’s trying to get a round in. Again, great course ruined by staff and inability to control crowding"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,It's hard to find a better place to play. Trophy club is a little out of the way but you're getting a better course at a better price.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,I come down here to play at least 3 times a year. Always a fun and challenging day.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,I enjoyed the. Purse. With the open layout it is very windy so bring your “Agamemnon” for play into the wind. Also please take the sand traps they need it and even a bit more sand
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,One of my favorites - maybe best value in Indy suburbs. Great course design with string shot values.Owner needs to spend money to make bunkers 1st class …. Right now they are “free-drop holes”New superintendent will have this is top shape eventually- the greens are the best they have been in decades
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"This course is immaculate, fairways and greens are always in great shape! The staff is top notch, always friendly and welcoming."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Course was in fantastic condition as usual.It is a layout that makes you plan your shots. Hazards galore, but very manageable. The undulating greens are very challenging but the speed is consistent throughout the course. It is without a doubt one of the nicest courses in the state."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Trophy Club was a beautiful links style course, it’s well maintained and the staff Mike and Russ were super nice and very helpful. Just a little tip: the driver isn’t always needed and nothing wrong with laying up to keep it in play, lose your ball in the high stuff and good luck finding it, I did find other balls to replace my lost ball though so that helped lol A challenging course and I look for ro playing again very soon."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"First time at The Trophy Club. I really enjoyed the course. If you played the tees that matched your handicap, you got see all of different lies. I got to use most of the clubs in my bag. The greens were great, the only disappointing part was that some player's before us didn't repair their divots. The staff was accommodating and great to deal with. I have friends that have a lake home on Raccoon Lake. Every time I get to Indiana, this is a course I will play. If you haven't played Trophy Club, you are miss out. I highly recommend this golfing adventure."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Five star. The on course shop from food, drinks to cigars!"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Course was in excellent condition and normally love playing there, but they botched the pace of play. We were 30 minutes behind at 10:30 in the morning with no explanation or apology. Several holes we sat and waited up to 10 minutes to tee off. We got through 14 holes and a storm kicked up. Had they kept up pace of play we would have finished. Very frustrating and took away from the positives this course has to offer."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"We played in less than four hours, which has not happened before out there. Happy to see it, but don’t know why."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,The course is always in good condition. It’s one of my favorite golf courses in the central Indiana area even though it is a little difficult. Great layout.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Our group absolutely loved this course. Conditioning is great and the layout had a great flow. Greens are tough they have a lot of undulation and run off areas but they roll pure. The course is challenging - especially if there’s a heavy wind and there are a handful of holes that require good strategy with tee shots but it’s a fun test. Fun 19th hole to settle bets as well. On top of all that the staff is great. Would definitely recommend giving this course a try!
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Course was in great shape only thing was they need to pay attention to the sand traps not enough sand them.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Love it. One of my favorite courses to play in the in the area.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Love this course. Great value for the money. The only complaint is that the bunkers were almost unplayable. The sand was hard and full of small rocks.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Very nice course that seems to be a hidden gem near Indianapolis. Nice out and back design by Tim Liddy. Challenging greens and you will use almost at 14 clubs at some point. Fairways, tee boxes and greens in great shape.. Staff very friendly. Nice halfway house mid course.. Highly recommend playing this course."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Have always loved this course and took the 45 minute drive to the middle of nowhere to play it. Love the layout, a lot of cool holes and a difficult course to play from the tips and blues. Most of the course was in good condition, greens were not super fast, but weren’t bad either. The bunkers however were awful. Multiple are like the dry mud you see at municipal courses and the rest are raked, but only the first half inch isn’t solid mud. Otherwise a good experience."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"I’m a big fan of Trophy Club and play there quite a bit The staff is very friendly and the fairways and greens are always in good shape. The one investment they need to make is their bunker maintenance as this has really changed past two years. The green side bunkers are very inconsistent, some with very little if no sand and some with enough. It can be frustrating when you have a good round going."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,I’ve played Trophy Club three times now. Excellent layout and greens. Bunkers could certainly use some work for a course of this level. The pace of play today was an issue today on a Monday. 5 hour round.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Course has great layout, design, and was in great condition. Pace of play was not great, but this was due to backed up tee times on a weekend due to AM storms."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Always enjoy playing here even have to drive 45 min. It’s all worthwhile.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Fairways and Greens in great shape. range is pretty good. not many amenities if you care about that. no beverage cart if you care about that also. food shack at at 10/11. The turn does not go back to pro shop/club house.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Only negative thing during the round was the fog delay that had all early tee times behind. ended up being a 4.5/5 hr round. just wish the groups in front would’ve had self awareness on pace of play.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"We try to play this course each time we take a trip through the Indianapolis area. Very good layout, playable and fair, great condition, good pricing, extremely friendly staff!"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Wonderful place to play golf that paired up with a group of guys and I really enjoyed playing with we had a good day weather was wonderful course was wonderful will come back and play again
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Trophy is an excellent course for all levels of players. The overall condition was superb in every way. The pro shop staff were very accommodating and friendly. Go out and play, this is one you won't regret."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Oregon player GHIN 12
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,A very nice layout in generally good condition. The pace of play was poor with no rangers to monitor groups play. The was the second time I hen experienced slow play this late summer.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,The greens and the golf course are simply brilliant in design and conditioning.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Trophy club requires golfers to bring their A game the entire round. The course is very difficult with well placed bunkers and collection areas around the greens. The greens are lightning fast and the fairways play form. Throw strong winds into the mix and the stage is set for one of the hardest golf courses in Indiana. The course was in fantastic shape, and my only comment about conditions would be the bunkers had standing water in them. Picking the right tees is critical at trophy club. It can play much longer than the card depending on the wind. Go, play, enjoy."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"It’s been 8 years since I played here last. It was in better shape then but was also more expensive..Greens and fairways were pretty good. Fairways are starting to get scorched but it’s 90+ in August, such is life."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Bunkers were TERRIBLE. The first bunker I hit out of I nicked the bottom of my wedge. There was a large rock just under the sand. So we dropped out of bunkers the rest of the day. When a course is trying to keep grass alive in the heat, so somethings gotta give. I’d trade decent greens for good bunkers any day."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"For sub $40, a 9:xx am tee time, and cool layout, It’s not a bad deal. Played in 3h30min"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Took 2.5 hours to play 8 holes and there were two foursomes on 9 tee we gave up.Not sure why they would schedule tee times like that.6 hour round is not good.I als saw 5 players on another hole. As we left.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Beautiful course and layout. Lots of high risk high reward shots/holes. Bunkers were in pretty rough shape the weekend we played. Some very soft and sandy, some very firm like dirt/concrete. Made it tough to consistently know how to play out from the bunkers, but overall a great course/round. Would definitely play again."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,This course never disappoints. Wind normally a big factor but hot calm day today. Love this course that provides unique shots and angles.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Great Course that is relatively forgiving. There are a good number of bunkers that’s need a little work but other than the the course is in fantastic shape! The best bang for your buck in the area. I would recommend playing here anytime.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Love playing the course. Great value in great shape. Bunkers could use some help. Challenging but enjoyable.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"When in Indy, we like The Fort. Nice staff, good range, challenging course.This time the greens were a bit off - wet and lots of play.The bigger disappointment was the bunkers.They are hard to avoid and the maintenance staff seems to have let them go.It hadn't rained in 72 hours but the bunkers were crusted over - many have grass growing.Sorry to say its not worth the money."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Fairways and greens are in great shape. Sand traps need to be a bit more “fluffy” to play true wedges. Still it was a great 18! I’ll be back!
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Course was in great shape. Greens were quick as usual and rolled nicely. Staff was friendly and welcoming! Got paired up with a nice couple which made the round that much more enjoyable.Only negative I will say about the course is they need to work on getting sand in the bunkers. I hit out of a few today it it was hard and no sand.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Course was in great shape.......however the bunkers need sand and more sand! The bunkers are just dirt with little rock pebbles in them.....if I had nice irons I would not hit out of them. Other than that, the course is a pleasure to play."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Was left stuck behind 3 groups of drunk guys who started late and played slow - because they were drunk and still doing shots on a 90+ degree day. Marshall did absolutely nothing to speed play. Had been a Trophy Club fan but absolutely embarrassed to bring an out of state guest to this course. Zero consideration for other folks on the course. TC should reconsider their policies on groups who behave badly.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"I live in fishers so I have no shortage of excellent courses to play within 15 min of my house (prairie view, purgatory, bear slide, fort, plumb creek)."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Trophy club is as good or better than all of those and the greens rival some of the private courses I’ve played. The drive was 36 min door to door and well worth it, especially when the green fees are $30 less than lesser quality course."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Trophy Club is one of my all-time favorite courses. Exceptional layout and will test every aspect of your game. This year’s weather has been favorable so the course is in great shape and so is the heather. If the greens were a bit faster it would be a challenge to play to your handicap.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Weather was incredibly hot but course was in tip-top shape. Greens were amazing and fun to putt on. Would like to return to play soon.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"This was my first time playing the course. It was a great experience from the club house the course. The course was very well maintained, from the tee through the green. A great course and will be back."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Course played well and was priced right. Pace of play was not monitored and it was played really slow. Very frustrating. Ruined what should have been a great round of golf.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"First time playing and was really impressed. Worth the drive as it feels like it’s the middle of nowhere. Lots of risk / reward holes, fast true greens and challenging layout, especially in the wind. Have to use the curves of the course like a links course and plot your way around. Usually like to walk a course but this place requires a cart, lots of hills and slopes and a long track. Would definitely recommend."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Exceeded expectations. Top quality public course that stacks up against the best public courses in the Indianapolis area. Course conditions were excellent. Greens rolled quick and true. May be the best bang for your buck of any course around Indy.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Trophy Club is always in good shape. It's a difficult track, driving lines are hard to pick out the first time you play it. They provide a yardage guide with hole information on the cart to help first timers. Overall, a good course that because of it's location, is a great value."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Would be a 5 star course but bunkers are all in really bad shape
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Trophy Club is one of my favorite courses to play when in the Indy area. It is a very challenging, well kept course without the inflated prices and pretentiousness of other courses in the area. Tough greens and long if you want it to be."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"This course will not disappoint you. It’s beautiful, well maintained, and challenging."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,For December this might have been the best value I've seen in Indianapolis!
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,The course was in pristine condition and there was no one on it - unbelievable for a 55 degree day!
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Greens rolled true, fairways were great and even the rough was maintained. The only area that was in winter condition were the traps - no grooming anymore."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,I would play this one every day if possible until it snows!
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"beautiful course, drove 180 miles just to play it again, would play all of the time if it was closer , played alot of courses around indy and love this one , i play allm around the midwest and can't go wrong with this course"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"I’ve played the fort, brickyard, prairie view, plum creek, bear slide, purgatory, hawthornes, Harrison hills, rock hollow which are all very good courses. I would put trophy club above all but maybe prairie view, super solid all around course. Probably a better layout than all of them."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Course was in shape. Bunkers are not good when it rains a bit and is cooler temps. No draining for them. Full of water. But it’s a links course. So plenty of places to miss bunkers. Rough was recently cut. Good and bad. You can see where your ball finishes. But with cut dry grass everywhere, it is still 50/50 if you find it. Fairways were right. Greens recently aeration job and sand topping. It’s a golf course and if you play well or not, the course is not the factor as always"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,What a great design of a course. Challenging greens every hole. Not a vanilla course. Great fall views. Nice fairways and tee boxes. Highly recommend.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Great day at the course and was in pretty good shape for this late in the fall. Greens have been aerated but still rolled ok. Partnered with my brother in law and it was his first time playing and loved the course. We will both be back in the spring. Best course for the money in Indianapolis!
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Always a good course and difficult under ordinary circumstance but when 20 to 30 to 40 mile and hour winds blow it plays extremely hard
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Everything about this course was terrific except the wind. Holy cow. Not windy in Indianapolis, but 30mins away... Made for a not-so-enjoyable afternoon. I think the wind situation is probably a common problem because it is out in the open. I wouldnt return or recommend to a friend simply due to the wind. My rating of ""poor"" for course conditions, and ""average"" for overall rating, was based solely on the wind - because everything else was outstanding. Absent wind, this would be an unbelievable value. $32 for 18 with a cart, on a course this nice - are you kidding me?!"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,The course was in great shape. A lot of turns and lot of rolling hills. The rough is thick so if you get too far off you won't find it. Fun course.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Excellent course and excellent late season price. Beautiful and challenging course..and becoming my favorite in the greater Indianapolis area..
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,A hidden gem in the northern suburbs of Indianapolis! Awesome course. Friendly staff and extremely well maintained.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"The course in itself, very challenging. There are at least three holes with sharp doglegs to the left. This course is not about a powerful tees, it is about strategic placement of your tee shot for most holes."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Several of the greens are tricky... If you overshoot some of the greens, you can consider your ball lost, since the re is either water or a sharp drop to thick grass or bushes."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Reasonably priced for the quality of play, regardless of you skill level."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"A picture perfect fall day: sunny, 75-80 degrees, light wind. The greens had just been aerated, but they were still in great shape. Unlike many courses, Trophy Club did not spread too much sand, so the greens were very puttable, just maybe not quite as lightning fast as they usually are. Things got a little backed up on the back 9, but I still finished in just under 4 hours. I like the variety of holes. This is definitely a thinking man’s course, as there are some hazards that aren’t always obvious from the tee and there are definitely right place to miss the greens and places you don’t want to go at all costs. So I am learning how to play it and enjoying it more each time by learning from my past mistakes!"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"The course was really nice, but it was so windy that it made it very challenging and almost no fun at times. In addition, the round took 5 hours and 40 minutes, which is by far the longest round of golf I have ever played! Liked the course, but could not do that again! Maybe return if the course was nearly empty."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,COURSE IN EXCELLENT SHAPE.DRIVR IN FAIRWAY A MUST!!
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Always enjoy playing this course. Need good shot placement. and you get rewarded for those good shots. Just wish I had more in the bag. Holes look longer from the tee box. Not much reward for the risk as the risk will bite you. Fun day.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Course was in good shape, better now than a last week when the bunkers were either holding water or in need of sand or repair. Good pace"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"The course is a direct competitor with Bear Slide in Cicero, The Fort, Purgatory in Noblesville, and Prairie View in Carmel. And a few more. It is my favorite of that group. Greens are quick but soft and can sometimes show some wear and tear. Fairways are excellent. They have some long rough but it doesn't jump out at you. The layout is great. The short holes are a challenge because the greens are narrow and undulating- so a little offline and you can get into trouble. Five of the first six holes are into the morning sun- so dew sweepers are hitting blind teeshots early in the round. Traps are mostly good with some muddy exceptions here and there- but they are maintained. There is a halfway house but it isnt always open- so get supplied before you start."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Greens and fairways were plush. Sand traps need a lot of attention...poor drainage. Cart paths are rough but for a public course, it offers a manageable challenge to low handicappers."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Course was in less than ideal shape today, but somewhat expected as there was about an inch of rain last night. The good: greens rolled true but quite slow; tees were in great shape; well marked for first time players. Problem areas were: rough was very patchy; fairways were destroyed by divots (ball stopped in five of them - they were everywhere!); no ranger (group in front of us had 6 holes open in front of them); and the grounds crew were obviously not trained as to not follow a specific group for five holes cutting the fairways while we were on the greens. The REALLY bad: one member of our group asked for his own cart, and they told ALL of us we had to pay an additional $15 per person! They only charged $49 for the entire round! They want an extra green fee PLUS for an additional cart??? No chance here! I paid my green fees and cart rental, I had my receipt, and I wasn’t dropping another dime for one person’s accommodation."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"I did not bring anything resembing golf to the Trophy Club and I enjoyed our round immensely, The shot values are often unique.The cousre is in good summer playing condition, the shop staff and clubhouse folks are unusually friendly and helpfull.It had been several years since I played Trophy club last but the challenge and feel Came rushing back immediately.."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Bring lot's of golf and play the heck out of this place!
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,It’s my Favorite Course in the Indianapolis Area
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Played this course with my son and a friend, both drove up from Indianapolis while I came from 1.5 hours north."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Great course, driving range, excellent condition (tees, fairways, and greens), very challenging, undulating greens, 4 sets of tees, not crowded, better have a good sand game - I could go on and on about all that is good about Trophy Club. Two negative course issues - it had rained the night before and many of the sand traps were water logged. Also, two of us played green tees and some of the holes were a little short."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,The Covid policy must be understood by all that golf at TC. We had 3 golfers and each was asked to pay an extra $15 (total $45) for one extra cart. We argued this was an extra green fee and cart fee but not the way the TC staff sees it. Other golfers also saw it our way as we overheard one group complaining and another out on the course we talked to also felt overcharged and had argued in vain.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,There is a senior charge that does not come up on the web site and must be asked for when you check in I guess (we missed it but were made aware of it after the round). They won't offer it to you even if you look to be a senior as we do.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"This was the first time I walked this course and I was pleased that it was pretty walkable. It does have some climbs, but at least there are no really long hikes from the green to the next tee. As a walker I would have appreciated it if they had mown more short cuts for walkers as an alternative to following the cart path. An extra 100 yards is nothing for a motor cart but a burden for a walker with a pull cart."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"I enjoyed this course a lot more from the senior tees than when I used to play it from the men’s tees (I am 68), although some of the senior tees were TOO short (par 4’s less than 300 yards). I played some of the holes from the white tees for this reason. This course has a nice variety of holes and there are definitely some things to learn about how to play the holes. Some of the holes are deceptive from the tee, where hazards are hidden or the fairway shifts left or right in the landing area. So it is a thinking man’s course."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"The fairways and greens were in very good condition considering how hot it has been and how little rain we have had. The greens are fairly much faster than the other courses I play regularly and the greens have some significant slopes, so you really have to study your putt and think hard. It could be a long day for someone who can’t handle fast greens. The rough was not too long, so being off the fairway was a mild penalty, but not death, which made it more fun for me. The sand traps were not in great shape: the one I was in on #18 was a dusting of sand on top of hard-pack. Many of the traps had seen a lot of water but hadn’t been groomed recently (I was playing on a Tuesday)."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Another problem for a walker is that the carts have pin position sheets and hole diagrams and pointers, but they do not have any handouts for a walker. I have started to make my own “book” about where to aim the tee shots and where to miss on the approaches. It came in handy yesterday and I added a few notes to it!"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Golf course is in great shape difficult especially around the greens but very enjoyable great value for the money
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Had a blast out at Trophy Club. Even though it was another hot and humid day the course played as good as can be expected. Good version of a links course that gives you a variety of options to play the hole and is an enjoyable strategic test. Greens, fairways, and bunkers are all getting great attention. Best thing about Trophy Club's setup and routing is it allows you to escape while you're playing the round. Highly recommend and only caution is when conditions are wet this place loses a little bit of the links appeal. Windy, bouncy, and fast are definitely the ideal ways to enjoy the Trophy Club."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,we played today and just had been through a few days of heavy rain. The course was not only in great co diction but the were no real puddles or standing water. Great course with some unique holes.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Course was in great shape. Slick, undulating greens. Pace of place was nice for a Saturday (thinking folks were scared by the threat of rain)."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"I haven’t played Trophy Club since before they had a permanent club house. Trophy Club has developed into a great golf course. Fairways were great! As an “average” golfer, the greens were fast and difficult. However, they were consistent. Bring your A-game and enjoy Trophy Club!"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,I felt like I was a burden to the shop when I checked in.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,No started getting groupie off the first tee.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Started 10 minutes late.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,No rangers on the course so 5 hours and 2 minutes later the round was finished.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Course is in good shape. Greens are quick but a bit bumpy.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Pace of play was awful and will keep me away for awhile. I could understand if it was cart paths only but the course was firm and dry.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Always heard about this golfer from fellow Golfnow players, so decided to try it out a few weeks backCourse is excellent especially for price. Challenges all your shot selections, then challenge your putting abilities with undulating greens"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"It was my first time playing here and I assumed based off of its location that it would be a standard flat links style course. While there are still a handful of flat holes they did a great job using the hills for elevated greens, sloping fairways and makes for an enjoyable 18 where every hole has a little something. A lot of risk/reward shots on dog legs so if your a longer hitter it made for some interesting decisions. Can be a punishing course if you have a bad driving day as there is a good amount of fescue and long grass. In my opinion it plays a lot like a Pete Dye course as there are plenty of shots where you will be second guessing your range finder or the yardage book they provide on the cart. Tees, fairways and greens were all in great condition. Well worth the money and a drive from Indy."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Considered how much rain we have had lately course was in great shape. A couple wet spots but fairways had roll , greens were quick and smooth..."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,See you again soon
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"I was visiting from South Carolina and drove 1.5 hours to play. Worth every mile. There is not a boring hole, the contours for a flat piece of country are awesome. One of the best conditioned course i have played even though the greens had recently been punched.Will definitely play again."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"The course was in great condition and the weather was good, after 12:00. Had a good time with friends, socially distant of course."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Made a day trip from Nashville, TN & decided to get a round in before heading back that evening. This was by far one of the best courses I've ever played. Staff was very friendly. The course was so green & lush. The tee boxes were mowed close & in great shape. The fairways were in perfect shape & the ball set up so nicely. The heather rough was punishing in some places & not so much in others. The greens rolled extremely true & they were quick. Every cart has a hole diagram giving you distances & troubles. If ever back up that way, this will always be a must play course."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Massive championship links course playing around 7300 from the tips. Beautiful piece of property with a great layout and sprawling fairways, huge tee boxes, and undulating greens. Every round here is a good time."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Kudos to the course maintenance staff. Having little to no rain for months, other than som sparse weedy rough where you should be punished anyway, course is still in very nice shape. Freshen some bunkers and you’re back to 5 star perfection. Still best layout in IN in my book."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,First time playing. From the first tee layout looks great and overall there are some interesting holes. That being said teed off at 9:20 and finished at 2:50! 5.5 hours to play-Inexcusable! Slow play is #1 reason won’t return here or other golf courses that can’t space times and manage the slow players. No ranger and no beverage person.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"If you are in the Indy or Lafayette area and have never played Trophy Club, do yourself a favor and book a round. In comparison to courses that are in a similar price range, TC is head and shoulders above. The course is challenging, yet accessible to most skill levels Beautiful scenery, friendly staff, excellent condition. Enjoy!"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,An incredible and well-maintained course that's walkable and challenging. Easy to see why it's considered one of the ten best in the state.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"This course is not for the faint of heart. It’s tough and the wind always seams to be blowing. The course is nice, great layout, large fairways and greens but scoring is not easy. If this course was inside 465, it would cost twice as much to play. If you golf in Indy, it is a must play."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,One of the best values in the Indy area. Twighlight rates are great. Fun layout and good course conditions
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,This course has everything you could want. Some holes are inviting you to go for it. Greens were perfect. Great links course. Will definitely go back.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Trophy Club is my favorite IN public course and the mid-day Hot Deal is the best!!!
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Always an enjoyable round. Great layout, in great shape and a great test of golf."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,This is one of the best courses in Indiana. Very tough Links golf and wind makes it even harder. Great condition and reasonably priced.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,have played this course several times and it is oneofthe best golfing experriences you will ever have the pleasure of playing golf greens are super fairways immaculate do play this course you will truely enjoy!!!!!
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Great course and always in good condition. Very windy which made the course play more difficult. Greens rolled true and fairways are in great condition.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Wow, course was in perfect shape. Greens were fast and a great round of golf. See you soon."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Was paired with a young man after other group brought an extra player. We got off early and were behind a 3some and a few 4somes so we knew it would be fairly slow but there wasn't anyone behind us all day so we just took our time and practiced around the green while we waited. Took about 4 1/2 hours but without pressure it was fine. The pairing was great and we had a good time from the Blue tees. I'm getting too old to play all the way back.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Beautiful course. It was in great shape all around. Pace of play was average. Staff was ok. Nothing bad but nothing special, just there. We have played some of the best known courses in Indy and my son and I agree is our favorite."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"This course is a joke. Looked like maintenance had not been working for weeks. Head Pro/Club manager was a jerk. By far the rudest person I have come across in the golf business, and I play all over. Greens were half dead. Fairways burnt in areas. Tee boxes overgrown. Save your time and money and stay away."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Living in Ohio makes it tough to get here that often. This is one of my all time favorite Indiana golf courses. I’ve played a bunch. If you’ve not played it, get off your backside and check it out. My only complaint is the bunkers. They’re a mix of dirt and small rocks. I struggled mightily. You probably need to pick them clean versus a normal sand shot."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,I can’t wait to go back.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,The Trophy Club never disappoints. Especially for the HOT DEAL I got for $24. Course was in immaculate condtions. Greens rolls fast and true and the course is always a challenge. One of my favorite courses. Top 3 in the Indianapolis area easily.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Beautiful links course in immaculate condition. Exceptional value for the money
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Great Course with challenging greens. Course play was pretty slow, we went on a Sunday afternoon and waited on groups ahead of us to finish up. With all that said we’ll definitely be going back!"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"I booked this course on golf now while in Indy for a volleyball tournament. Had good reviews and a good price. What we got was an unbelievable deal. This course was absolutely beautiful and in pristine shspe, except for the bunkers. The bunkers had a lot of washout and were thin mud. But it was not the courses fault. A lot of torrential rain recently had taken its toll but the courses was working on them as we played. Even that be the case I still gave this course five stars because of how perfect everything else was. Not an easy course. Will test your short game for sure. Every hole was different and some beautifully designed risk/reward holes for big bombers. I’m sad I may not get to play this course again."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"You really need to invest in starters/rangers. This is the absolute worst course in the area for pace of play. I haven’t finished my round here on a couple occasions. Excellent layout, excellent conditions, nice people, but rarely an enjoyable round due to the waiting. Work on that and people would be willing to make the long drive more often."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"This is a great course and gem of the area. Many local business people play here during the week. We played for a friend's bday and had a great time. Our only issue was pace of play. We play quick and when the shots go well we play a round in about 3 hours or less. We were able to tee off ahead of a foursome. We had no one within eye sight the first 6 holes. By 8 we had a lone golfer a hole behind. By 10 we let him play through. By 12 we had another that we let play through and we were caught up to a threesome ahead of us. At 12 there is a ""half way shack"" that is stocked with anything you need. That threesome included the lone golfer by hole 13 and then they never made progress or kept pace quick. They did apologize at 18th tee for the group ahead of them playing slow. I believe there was a group on the green, another in the fairway, and us on the tee. I love golf and happy to see people playing but 9 minute gaps may be too tight. Picture is from 12th green. Friend and I about 75 yds out."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,The course was in great condition considering all the rain we have had. Can’t wait to play it again when the weather is better. Always a great test of golf.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,This course never disappoints; there are 24 courses in a closer proximity to my home and I drive by every one to go to Lebanon and play The Trophy Club. Weather was crap but I never enjoyed golfing in the rain more. Awesome experience; never disappoints!
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Found course challenging, but easier to stay clear of trouble than expected!"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Greens were fast, challenging, and in great shape."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Course combined w perfect weather made for a wonderful day!
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Trophy Club always leaves you wanting more. It's in solid shape tee to green already this year, and well worth a trip or stop if you're traveling on 65 between Lafayette and Indianapolis."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Love playing this track! Course is challenging and conditions are always mint. For late April the course is in beautiful shape. My group and I always have a great time out there. It’s kind of a drive from Indy but well worth it. PLAY TROPHY CLUB!!!
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Course was in great shape especially for how early in the year it is. Fairways had been mowed and rolled which was very nice. Def like the variety of holes and the overall layout of the course.Will def be back soon.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Trophy Club is always a treat. I've played it many times and in every season. The course is always is excellent condition. The time I am writing about was in early April. The greens were surprisingly fast for this early in the season. Temperature was about 50 and the wind was blowing 12-15 MPH so it was a bit nippy. But, it was sunny and I was not in the office. Every hole seemed to play directly into the wind but somehow still managed to pull out an 84 so I walked away looking forward to the next time."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Greens were very fast ! Loved’emFairways were the best we have played and it was late March. They were very good ,One of the best courses around.Outstanding course,layout,and demanding greens !BG"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Course is in excellent shape. Can’t wait to play it again.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Course was wonderful, especially the coolers of free drinks left over from the outing right before us which were most appreciated in the 95 degree heat!!!"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Heat got the best of me so the course won!!!!
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Love the layout, the tough greens, beautiful scenery. Really nice course for the money."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Beautiful course layout and scenic.. The sandtraps were very deep with very hard and wet sand. Next to impossible to keep shot on the green. The greens are massive without an inch of flatness anywhere on them. Most holes were cut on the top of a hill so if your put had enough speed to get to the cup and you missed,it would roll 20' by"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,A fine links style test. Keep the ball in play which it will test high and low handicaps. Greens are sandy but very fast. Will go back ASAP. The flipchart guide attached to every cart along with USB plugin is an excellent touch also!
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Great course to play for the intermediate level player or the beginners looking for a tough challenge! Great course to play and for the price it was fantastic to play. Lost a couple balls but it was worth it playing this course. Will be back for sure!
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Great course one of the best around. Definitely worth a drive
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,it has been raining a lot the last few days and the course has handled it well. Some standing water on tee boxes but it did not cause any problems. The course looked great. Greens were rolling well. Great place to play. Pace of play was good
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"3rd time i’ve played this course and it’s always in perfect condition.Fairways are the some the nicest i’ve ever played.The greens are a challenge. Not a flat spot anywhere and slick as glass. A very enjoyable combination.Only complaint is that the “halfway house” in (middle of holes 4 and 10?), is never open. Restroom break and drink would be nice after 9 holes.I would recommend this course to anyone that appreciates a golf course that is well taken care of."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"My golf partner and I jumped at Hot Deal on this premier course. I had wanted to play here for years and this course sure did not disappoint. It may have been the last nice day of the season so it was a bit stacked up but the pace still moved along steadily. The course was in fantastic condition considering it is season end. The fairways and rough were will groomed and even the heather areas were neatly outlined. The traps, and I found most of them, were soft and very playable. The greens are diabolical but smooth and fast. Love the course and can't wait til next season."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,For full disclosure I came to the course from Illinois so your trek may not be as 'off the beaten path' as mine.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"First off, I prefer wide open courses like this one. For the most part the fairways were wide and forgiving...however, IF you miss the fairway you are looking at a possible big number! Additionally, I'd bet a fair amount that the course designer studied, and took many design queues, from Pete Dye. The carts have the hole layouts and descriptions, plus I had my (Excellent!) Arccos app but I am here to tell you that on many of the holes there were layouts with visual aspects that left you scratching your head about where and how far was best how to approach the hole. The course makes you use every club in your bag...that I believe is one of the key signs of a great design and layout."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Sooooo once you determine how you are gong to get to the green NOW you are in for a real adventure! The greens ranged quite a bit in size, shape and orientation but what was common to all of them was multiple levels and many serious undulations that you had to pay attention to and without a 'pro yardage book' you are literally shooting blind even if you can 'see' the green. If you are close to the green (50 yards in) it is best to walk up and check out the pin placement (apologies to pace of play!) and especially to see if there are any nearby swales that will take even a slightly errant shot down into a drainage area or a bunker. I hit what I thought was a beauty right at the flag only to see it spin right back down and off the green into trouble...I did not get up and down and went from Birdie attempt to a double bogey ;-(."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"This is definitely a course that you need to play more than once to get a feel for it, and once you play it for the first time I think you will, like me, want to get back and play it again soon!"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"Lastly, I want to thank The Trophy Club for hosting our Golf Channel Amateur Tour tournament, the course was in great condition for us. For those of you out there who have even a remote interest in playing new courses (including private ones), meeting lots of new friends, and playing competitive (flighted!!) golf please go check out the Golf Channel Amateur Tour http://gcamtour.com and join your local tour...you will not regret it!!"
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"It was a crisp and cool Saturday, and you would think G.B. would be glad to have us there. Obviously not. He wasn’t friendly at check-in, and not when we were looking to buy some beverages for the round. Too bad. This is one of my favorite courses in the area."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"My first time playing here, drove down from Chicago to play this course with my brother who lives near Indy. Course was in great shape and the holes are interesting and well maintained. The only issue I had with the course was they had obviously had too much rain/water and the sand traps often had standing water in them and even when they didn’t the sand was compacted and hard. Otherwise I have nothing but praise for the course."
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,Trophy Club is almost an hour from my house and in the past was on my play once a year list. This year when days were longer I played the after 5 rate several times and decided to take a half day off work and take advantage of a Golf Now rate. I really like playing here.
The Trophy Club,5837-the-trophy-club,"I don’t have enough good words to describe this golf course. I’m from Lafayette, yet making the small trek to Lebanon is worth the time. Every aspect of the course is beautifully cared for. The tee boxes, the sand, the fairways and greens all welcome and invite you to enjoy this links course. You won’t be disappointed."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"This course requires an accurate driver, as there is OB on EVERY hole. If you can do that, you’ll have a great time! I’ll be back for sure."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Really enjoyed the layout of the course. It was day after rain and quite soggy, but even so the tee boxes and greens played well. Lots of OB, but if you can drive relatively straight you are all good. Will definitely be back. Great walking course!"
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Course was in awesome condition. No complaints about anything
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Course was in great condition. I routinely play this course because of the value and layout is good for the intermediate player that I am. I had good round of 90 on day.Putting was off due to me pushing the ball, but the greens rolled Ture."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Course was in good shape, the layout is good. Plenty of trees and OB to make you play smart."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Firstly, the staff was very nice and informative. I let them know I'm from out of state and I was just happened to see their course was 7 minutes from my hotel room so I thought I'd check it out. They showed me around, drinks were cheap and the staff had a smile on."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"What I hated was the course. EXTREMELY cramped and there's so many houses that I had anxiety the whole time because I was worried about accidentally hitting someone's house or car. Picking up my ball from under a kids swing set slide was embarrassing because the family was outside watching me play. It was the most stressful game of golf I've ever played. I wasn't relaxed, was rushed because of a women's league who takes over the course at 5pm, and I wish I could've just been refunded after the 3rd hole."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Overall the course was excellent. Got a good deal through GolfNow and the course was challenging and had many very nice features, now the proviso, it was the day of a major outing, and I felt like I was an inconvenience to the staff just by showing up to an advertised ( and paid for) tee time, from the very moment I parked, I was “asked” to park better so I wouldn’t take up extra space for the outing attendees, never mind the fact that this was completely unnecessary because I was parked just fine, and I was long gone before even a single outing participant showed up.i was asked to start on back 9, not a huge deal but just one more concession k was “asked” to make. Had to wait for over ten minutes for the cup to be changed on a green I was seconds away from making my approach shot. So, bottom line, recommend, just don’t go on outing day, unless your part of the outing I guess."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Greens were good played during the middle of the day there was no one there finished 18 in 2 hours rough was high sometimes u could find ur ball but u had a hard time hitting out of it
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,The course is in great shape. Greens run fast and they will challenge you. Fairways are tight. Not much forgiveness if you're not hitting straight. Pace of play is never an issue. Staff are amazing.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"The course is always in nice condition, and the staff is always extremely friendly. One of my favorite places to play."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Really nice staff and course conditions are good will play again.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"This course plays well. It's a little deceiving. It doesn't appear intimidating. But if you're not hitting straight , you can get in trouble real quick. The entire course is well maintained. Greens run fast. The staff are awesome. Never a disappointment playing here."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"I was not expecting a course in Indiana to be in this good of shape in the middle of December. Staff was super friendly, I’ll be back the next warm day we have. Can’t believe I haven’t played this one before now."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"This course has a magnificent layout and requires shot making skills. The greens were smooth and fast but rolled true. The fairways were cut and the rough was healthy which tested your skill, as it should. I'd definitely play this course again."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"First time playing this course. Nicer than I was expecting for the price, so a great value for sure. Pretty average flat, tree-lined layout with houses everywhere and OB in play on every hole besides the short par 3 17th, so not really my style of course personally. Greens rolled very smooth for this late in the season. All the staff members were super friendly. Worth checking out."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Course was extremely consistent and boring. Felt like 85% of the holes were straight away and going uphill within 10 yards from the putting green. Challenging course, but too consistent."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,I’ve been playing this course for many years and it’s in the best condition now than it’s ever been. So good it’s worth playing just for the course condition.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,The Layout is descent no problems would have played from the tips. Lil bit of water not a big factor and bunkers sand where soft. The tee boxes and fairways where in great conditions ins a great course.Pace- It was great until hole 13 hole but it was ok . I would definitely come back and play the course. The club house was in great condition prices where decent.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Was out with 2 from Texas great guys. Staff very helpful and professional. A few trees damaged recently but not in any way intrusive to the general course. It was in great condition. Friendly and polite staff. Would definitely recommend it and play it again next visit.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Cart guys are awesome!Course is always a pleasure to play. Also, I learned to play here. Love it."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"I have played this course twice now. It is a good course for the price. The staff is always friendly and they have great service. The course could use some work, but can’t judge for just the price of $30. The bunkers are a little rocky and the dandelions are pretty bad, but other than that the course is decent."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Tee boxes, fairways, and greens all in fine shape considering the time of year. Pace of play was excellent. Staff always on point."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Although a little wet, course played well. Greens a bit slow due to moisture and probably not being mowed for a while. All in all, much better than expected for this time of year. New staff, Nick and Matt, are awesome. That in itself is a real, positive change."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Good course kids tight but a good course fun round
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Great layout. Not overly challenging. Greens are fairways in very good condition. Super staff, especially the new pro, Nick."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Nice course. I hadn't played the course in over 20 years. Management is doing a fantastic job of keeping this hidden gem in excellent condition.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Family in for the weekend. Was able to get tee times on GolfNow a week in advance. Even after an inch of rain only 4 holes were cart path only. Greens rolled true. Fairways drained well. Sand traps in good condition. Pace of play was leisurely. We pressed no one and no one pressed us.Easy course. Short overall distance. Tight for some of our group. Homes and apartments either side of the fairway. No real trouble to have to contend with.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Course was in excellent shape. Staff very friendly.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Played mid-day, on a Thursday. It was quiet. The course was attractive and extremely well kept, with excellent tee box, fairway, and green conditions - especially for late summer in Indiana. Bunkers were rock-hard. Carts were good, and they bring them right to your car when you arrive."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Staff was super-friendly. The course wasn't terribly challenging with perhaps the exception of some of the sloping greens.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Bottom line, this is one of the nicest courses I've played within the $20 - $30 price range. I will certainly return, and I highly recommend it for beginner to intermediate players."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,You can tell this course and the area were premiere destinations in the 70's/80's. The facilities themselves still feature the vintage decor.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"The staff is excellent, bringing the golf cart to your vehicle and very friendly."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Pace was also excellent - finished 18 holes with three people in 3 hours, and that included a few minutes of a rain delay! Some of the fairways weren't the best but for $30 or so for twilight, you can't beat it. Give it a go!"
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Always a pleasure to play here. Not overly challenging.But great for a ""nice"" round of golf. The course is always in great condition. Greens are somewhat fast. And Marty in the pro shop is the best. The cart staff is super too."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Course is always well maintained. Layout is nice. A few narrow fairways. Nothing overly challenging. Pace of play is usually good. It's a nice course to get in a relaxing round.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Got a Hot deal rate of $25. Didn’t expect much, really. Played here a bunch in the 80’s when it was private and in excellent shape. Golf boom kind of did the private club thing in. But it was in pretty good shape. Yeah, there were some distressed areas on the fringes of some greens, and the greens aren’t nearly as fast as they used to be, but for $25 it is a steal. Fun track, albeit in the middle of a apartment/housing complex. Hit it straight and you can score here!"
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,I will go back.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Very nice and well kept course and very well ran. I will definitely come back and play again
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Old school golf course. Extremely friendly staff, and a really nice pro shop. Course was in nice condition."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"The course itself is fine for what we paid, no complaints there. Some of the greens were burnt up and as a first timer playing there, the lack of signage pointing to the next tee box was confusing. It's located in a residential area and we saw several people just golfing between holes and even a dude riding in a cart with his dog chasing after him. I don't mind it, since the pace of play was quick, but I'm pretty sure one of the guys just practicing his chipping on the front 9 stole one of my golf balls..."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"The necessary evil, maintaining the greens with coring and sanding. It will be fine in a couple weeks. Otherwise the course is so well maintained. Super staff."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,My 9 year old grandson and I had an outstanding time playing Valle Vista. The course and weather were great and the staff was very friendly and accommodating.; especially the club house gentleman They made us feel very welcome and were patient as my grandson is still learning to play and learning golf course etiquette.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Never too crowded. Entire course is well maintained. Staff friendly and personable.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Multiple people booked for the same tee time. Guy at the front desk was rude. They accepted like a group of 20 from another golf course and pushed us along with other people. Course was overall nice.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Just moved here.It was a little wet from the night before. And a bit chilly. Overall, the course is in great shape. Greens were decently fast. Fairways were fine. A few wet areas from the rain. The entire 18 was very playable."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Greens were a bit dimpled from aeration. Otherwise great conditions. Leaves were all cleared. Course plays well. Staff is cool. Always ready to help and good guys to joke around with.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"If you just want to get out and have a nice round of golf, this is the place. Nothing too crazy about it. You just need to hit the ball straight. The playing conditions here are always so good. Fairways are tightly mowed. Greens run fast. The staffis super. They are always on point as far as the best customer service."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Staff was super nice and helpful with all my questions my only gripe about the course was the bunkers could use some love. Other then that greens were good some dead spots but nothing crazy. Good golf course I will be back to play again.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Always enjoy playing here. Nice layout. Always well-maintained. Greens were just cored and sanded. A necessary evil.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,The course always hold water and should have been cart path only but since most cannot follow the rules the course got a little cart damage.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"This golf course is always amazing and beautiful! We’ll maintained and plenty of scenery, due to it being the wedding Capitol of Greenwood!"
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"As a foursome of college students, many golf courses can be rude and unwelcoming because they think we will be too reckless or just because we are younger than most. Valle Vista has been great. Great course. Extremely friendly staff, both in person and on the phone. Will 100% be coming back to this place. Great value as well. They have a student discount for only $25."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Nice neighborhood course. Greens and fairways in good shape
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Greens very good as far a putting but very firmFairways above averageTee box’s goodBunkers need sand placed in bottom of them andthey would be country club standardLittle slow play at the time we started
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"I love golf but a great staff makes me love an experience. While two weddings proceeded in the event center and near the course, the staff accommodated us in every way possible. The guy who met us in the parking lot with a cart and explained where to go could not have been nicer. Course challenges you in every way possible. We’ll be back! Thank you, staff."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"First time playing here, the staff were all very friendly and helpful, the course was real wet after a day of torrential rain but playable, Almost all the holes have greens up on a plateau, the course was in good shape and it's worth playing."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"You can usually find deals for Valle Vista for around $25-$30 which is a fair price for this course. Fairways, tees and greens were in good shape (wish they would do more to remind golfers to fix ball marks). I think it would help if every course would remind golfers when they check in that they are expected to repair divots and ball marks, very few courses do it. The only sad spot for this course were the sand traps! The problem is they threw a little sand on top of hard pan spread it out so it was about 1/4"" thick on almost every trap, so it looked pretty good until you realized there was very little sand on top of the hard dirt underneath. It would have been better if they had put a decent amount of sand in maybe a third or half of the bunkers instead of almost none in all of them. At least that way you would have had several holes with good sand! rather than almost all holes where the bunkers were lousy."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"This course fir as old as it is , still a fun track , tight fairways , forgiving greens for now until it dries out ! There are problem spots on fairways with puddles and utility boxes and other things like that but if you can hit it straight then it should be no problem ! If they get real sand back in the bunkers the green complex’s will be nice ! Not overly complicated Course just gotta hit good shots at all times !!"
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Pros:Counter person very niceFairways ok will be better after some growthGreens summertime speed and smoothBunkers have good sand, need racks to useCons:No real cons that would upset for Time of yearPlayed really bad but not courses fault"
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Course wasn’t grassed the best but seeing as its early March, I give a pass for that. Holes are fair and greens are pretty flat. The fact that it’s inside a housing/ apartment addition is scary though as I don’t always hit so straight.. some of the houses/ apartments are right on the fairways"
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,The course is always challenging but fair. Brandon's and his staff are very accommodating and supportive.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,greens great. fairways adequateArchitect and designer most underrated course designer in state.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,course is average. reviews make it seem way better than it is. their tee times are messed up so you’ll end up with 4 slow groups in front of you and quitting after 12 holes like us because it took you an hour and a half to get to the twelfth hole after the turn. find another place if you’re looking for a nice course. this course is just not it. especially for the money.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Got this on a Hot Deal, and the title says it all. First round of the year and at this course, so was looking to work on my swing without getting punished too severely. The staff was friendly and accommodating, the facilities clean and reasonably appointed. No wait at the first tee and and we played in 3 1/2 hours (Tuesday mid-morning round). The course winds through apartments, condos and houses so you can’t stray too far off line. The fairways & rough were cut to nearly the same length which was fine for us. The greens were a little slow and tee boxes were in very good shape."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,The pace of play is PAINFULLY slow!! 5hr round slow!! Waiting more than 8 minutes on each tee SLOW!! That’s what happens when you have a 6300 yard par 70 and everyone plays the back tees!! Why the course doesn’t shut dow the blue and white tees just for pace of play is beyond me!!!
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,The course itself is nice enough...just be ready for SLOOWWW PLAY!!
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Course is always in fantastic shape and worth the price. Staff is amazing as Brandon and his team work hard and treat everyone like long time members.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Valle Vista requires using every club in the bag and excellent accuracy. It is a great test to any other course in the area.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Loved the course and the staff was very nice and made it known they enjoyed having us there. Great service.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"The course was nice no issues with it at all. Greens and fairways nice and green especially with no rain for over a month. What I take issue with is paying on linein advance for a tee time and get there and we have a group get in front of us that has a later tee time. Complain to the folks inside but they could care less. Respect the tee times reserved and get your ""Country Club"" a starter and ranger to manage tee times."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Especially, Green was so beautiful. It was special condition for all of 18H. I really enjoyed a little bit fast Green."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,The course was fantastic and I encountered friendliest staff in history!!
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"I reviewed the course layout as a 4 only because it is very tight and narrow, if I was better I would have been fine."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Brendon -Head Pro always makes you feel like family while playing Valle Vista. Greens had been aerated and dressed but were very puttable. Course in great condition with the lack of rain over past three weeks
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"2 groups of (5) and a group of (3) ladiesin front of us a (4) some5 1/2 hour roundLadies played very quickly, they waited every shot.As well as our group and the rest of the courseBehind us. Was told by course that it was men’s cluband they are not controlled by management.Who lets groups of 5 out on a FridayINEXCUSABLE"
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Had a good time, fairways were in pretty good shape, greens have been kept up. Staff that I delt with were courteous."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Very nice. Good condition. Great value. Friendly staff. Met us in parking lot w/ cart. Let us off 45 min early. Wife and I played 18 in 2.5 hrs.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"If you become comfortable with Valle Vista, you can play any course. It's tightness forces accuracy, but still rewards distance."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Valle Vista is a great value for an established course. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They meet you at your car with your cart. Check in is easy and again very friendly people. The pace of play was at three hours.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"The friendliness of the staff makes this course great for the price. You are greeted with a cart when you park. The staff in the clubhouse is great. The course itself is in so so shape, but I will say that compared to other courses for the same amount of money you aren’t going to get better."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,course in excellent shape. fairways rolling and greens really nice. plated in 3 hours.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"This is a nice course, and it was a great value. Unfortunately, there was a late tournament that was going on that we were not told about, and the back nine had a 30+ minute wait to start. We ended up playing the front nine again, but we would have liked to be informed about the tournament and wait before paying to play here. The front nine was fun, challenging, and in good condition though."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Course in great shape. Cart path only today because of the rain.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Valle Vista is in outstanding condition. The pace of play was good - we finished our 18 holes in 3 1/2 hours. I recommend this course for players who want a fair and playable experience.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Too many of us backed up. The pace was slow. Waited 10 minutes or more each time before I could tee off
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Convenient location for local Greenwood residents good golf for the money without the long drive and slow play
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Valle Vista is a good course, well maintained and the staff is exceptionally professional and hospitable."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,This course was in very good shape! The greens and fairways were cut. The staff was very friendly . I loved how the course practiced social distancing!!!!Awesome Experience!!!!
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Where else can you play that when you pull into the parking lot someone brings you your cart? Super friendly staff, nice layout, course not that challenging even from the tips, but in good shape."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,The course has a nice layout lotta elevated greens Fairway and greens were in immaculate shape staff was very very friendly I would recommend this to my friends.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Great. Time .. Great course .... Staff is exelent from start to finish ........ Pace of play was continuous ... Hardly any wait at each hole .. I would recommend. Valle Vista to all
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Unfortunately I did bring my concern to the employee in the shop and the response I received was I will bring it to the attention of our head pro. No can I get your number or email for follow up of the concern etc.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,My suggestion would be to have an etiquette class for your maintenance staff to be courteous to golfers on the course and especially not to engage in any negative verbal confrontations.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,We as players understand the maintenance staff is doing their best to provide the best conditions and only ask that they stop and allow us to hit our next shot and move on. We shouldn’t have to ask them to stop multiple times or have to back away from a shot.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Best of luck to you however there are plenty of other golf courses that treat their players better that I will be playing going forward.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Always fun to play. Was in decent shape and played in a little less than 3 hours. Great value.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"I'll keep this short. Valle Vista is a great golf course in terms of what you get for the money spent. It is always in good condition. They have someone bring you a cart at your car, the pace of play is good and the golf is challenging but extremely fair. Stay on the fairways, stay out of trouble. Friendly staff. Honestly the best value in golf on the south side of Indy."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Course in great shape for this time of year, only played 8 holes before it got dark. Very windy today which kept us from playing nine holes."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,we played on a Tuesday morning after a heavy rain Monday night. The course took the rain in stride. There were a few soft spots but didn't affect play. The weather was perfect low 80's with a lite SW wind. We both shot our normal scores well maybe a little better. It was so nice out and the course was in such good shape. All the mowing was caught up and the greens were fairly fast which was good.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Course always plays fairly quick, there is actual sand in the traps and Brandon is always cool."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,This course is long and tight at spots. The rangers are very friendly and meet you at your car with a cart. They always ask my daughter how she did and make her feel good. We love this course.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Have played here several times with my 12 year old son who is loving the sport of golf. The staff is always do darn nice and professional. This is a somewhat difficult course with very small greens. Tee boxes, fairways and greens are always in great shape!For the price, you just can't beat it! Thank you Valle Vista from my son and I!"
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Great day for golf. Course was in very good shape. The fairways were holding some water and rough was thicker than usual, but still very playable."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Course was I decent shape. Front nine played on pace. At the turn there was a backup of at least three groups. We played the first nine again in just over an hour.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Warm reception at parking lot as you are met with smiles and a golf cart to load your clubs.Brandon Bezy Head Pro is excellent understanding behind each round is a individual who not just a greensfee.. We play Valle Vista consistently as the course is fair challenge and course conditions are superb.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,After a long winter and one of the wettest springs on record finally it dried out enough to play. The course was in excellent condition and the greens were running fast and true. It was the perfect spring day 75 degrees and sunny with a slight SW breeze. They had gotten all the front rough mowed and were getting caught up on the back. Great staff and good eats.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Told ranger about group that was slowing play and he did nothing
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Great day, course was nice, staff was very friendly , pace of play was not bad at all for 1st really good day of golf for the year."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Never in all my years have I ever had a maintenance worker be so rude. Hit a drive right and had to back away from my second shot multiple times due to a worker buzzing around on a cart and when I asked him to stop and be still he made a snide remark about the tee shot I hit. By the way I hit an 8 iron over the trees to 12 feet and made birdie thanks.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,With the rudeness of the staff I now know why they have $17 hot deal tee times.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,It’s a shame because the layout is always fun to play and the course was in decent shape but I will never go back.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Play a little slow, but busy. Greens in good shape for October. Fairways average. Liked course setup, good mixture of short and long holes. Course made you THINK about how you wanted to play the holes. Good staff, very friendly!!! Some holes had aeration plugs in fairway, a little annoying!!"
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Course and greens in great condition considering past 30 days no rain. Like the challenges of tee shots with trees lining several fairways . Holes 6 and 7 long par fours alway requiregood tee to green play. Escape these two holes even par is a accomplishment.Mr Bezy and the Pro shop staff always make you feel welcomed. Play 6+ times per year at Valle Vista.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,The course is laid out nicely. The staff was very friendly. The greens are in great shape and the tee boxes are level. The course could use more water it is dry and spots. There is actually sand in the sand traps. The surrounding neighborhood a mixture of condos and houses is a bit unkempt. But over all it is a good value.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Well maintained, not too hard not too easy, has some bunkers/water hazards here and there. Greens played true. Will be back!"
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,This is the best course to play in the South Indy area. Super friendly staff. Course always in good condition. Great value. I love Valle Vista!
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Course was in pretty good shape, and the areas under repair were pretty well marked. Would come here again and often. Good course for the price you pay."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"I was in town for the holiday and booked my round a few days before via Golfnow. I did a little research and had a suspicion I would like this course. I was blown away by the whole experience. And it was CHEAP. Shout out to the pro and the gentlemen working carts! Greens are small, undulated and we'll protected. Fairways are comfortably wide but still required accurate drives for good looks in. There were a few opportunities to take less than driver off the tee. Play this course!!"
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Play here often. Course is in good shape. Just mowed, no weeds, bunkers groomed, lots of maintenance happening. Tee boxes and greens showing some play but above average condition.Some occasional ground under repair working on drainage improvements. Tough layout with out of bounds lining every hole and close in some spots. Lakes were full up after the recent rains but little standing water. Got a Golfnow deal and well worth the discounted rate."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Valle Vista poses a challenging, yet fair round for any golfer. The extremely tight fairways kept my 4-iron busy off of almost every tee-box, while the soft greens were in perfect shape. Although the course was tight, I thoroughly enjoyed the memories made with my buddies at Valle Vista. Will definitely come here again... but only if I'm prepared to lose a few golf balls."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,We drove 40 miles to play this course. We teed off at 1 behind a foursome of older guys that we found out were in the Mens Club. It took my buddy and I 4:45 mins to play `18 holes on a 90 degree day. I saw something I have never seen in 40 years of playing golf. The foursome was on 17 and was measuring the putts with a string or tape measure. It took 12 mins from the time we hit out tee shot on one hole till we could hit our 2nd. When we went in the cart man said he was sorry for how long it too and that is when we found out about the Mens Club playing on a Friday afternoon. Not good planning in my book.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"This course is in great shape and drains really well so playing after a day or two of rain is no problem. All holes are straight so what you see is what you get. But there are enough challenges without having any doglegs or blind shots. Water comes into play on 8 holes and there is out of bounds on every hole though there is plenty of room for error on most holes. There are very few fairway bunkers while almost every green is guarded by at least one greenside bunker. It's not a long course, just under 6,000 yds from the white tees. You get exceptional service from the rangers who bring a cart to your car and pro shop staff are great."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,I’ve played this course several times. Staff in clubhouse are probably friendliest I’ve encountered in Indy. The conditions were great. Accuracy with driver valued at this course above all
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"One of, if not the, best places to play on the SS, for the price/value. Very green and we’ll kept and. watered. Staff was friendly as well as the course maintenance crew. Highly recommend!"
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Although there is a beautiful course and good guide, too crowded and waiting for a long time to tee up at every holes. Spending more than 5 hours makes us uncomfortable."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,I have not played this course in at least 10 years. It is a tight course with lots of houses and condos around. The fairways and tees were perfect. Greens were very nice but a little slow for my taste. It appears that they have done extensive bunker work. They were the best I have seen around Indy. A must play especially if you get the hot deal
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Was a great experience from the time the cart person delivered the cart to our car, counter check in person, to course workers, everyone was very welcoming. Fee was tremendous for such a beautiful course. Great all around."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Bought a pass from golf now.My friend and I got their early as we did the last time not thinking that we would get to tee off early.When we got to course the tee box was empty and the person working was giving us a hard time cause he didn’t want us to play earlier cause he said they don’t make any money from people that sign up through golf now??????
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Can’t beat Valle Vista for a public golf course. Prices are reasonable and the staff is genuine and nice. Can be difficult if you’re not consistent off the tee though. Out of bounds is plentiful, and the few water hazards come into play significantly. Overall wonderful public course on Indy’s South Side."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Great course with a friendly staff. Course is challenging but manageable. Price was unbeatable. Will make the drive anytime!
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,I love VV it has really grown on me over the years.This course favors the straight ball hitter. Greens are great. Guys at the counter are very cool.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Course was in very good condition with greens rolling well for December. Brendon head pro is always welcoming. He is a great asset to promoting both Valle Vista and golf.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Amenities were fantastic. No problems the whole time. Was there with a new guy so a round took us about twice as long as normal. Staff was patient with us and ranger wasn’t up our rear end. Peaceful and quiet for being in the middle of greenwood. It was an awesome course, time, and experience with Valle Vista."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Valley Vista is a nice corse. Late in the year and the course was in excellent condition. Got the round for $10 plus fee. Couldn’t beat it.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Very cooperative staff. Fantastic value through GolfNow. In a housing development, so don't slice or hook greatly. Many holes are similar. But cry well maintained. Would definitely play here again."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Always nice, always a bit awkward walking to 10th tee box around groups of wedding people but not the first time there so I knew that going in that it could happen. Practice green is right next to ceremony location . I just started without much putting due to that possibility."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Played here on a Sunday afternoon with my son. They started us on the back nine, but the pace of play was great. Course was in really good shape. Greens were good, fairways were great and most of the tee boxes were good. A lot of water, so you had to be careful off the tees, but it made for an enjoyable day. We finished our round in about 3 1/2 hours. The course is a par 70 and only had 2 par 5's unless you were playing off the blue tees. I will play there again when I get back to Indy."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Not a tough course but it does have many challenges with the trees and water. Several greens with small approach.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Staff and course were excellence but all the Sunday drivers were ahead of us long day
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,"Old golf course, short walk from tee to tee. Fairways are beautiful and wide enough for average golfer. The Greens roll perfect with lots of slope. Highly recommended we really enjoyed this course."
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,was not expecting much for a course in the city in the middle of so many homes - wish i had played here sooner - very happy - will definitely go back
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Every time I finish playing at Valle Vista golf course - I wonder why I don't play it more often. Greens are great. They aren't good. They're great. The rough hands out just enough of a penelty and the bunkers were raked perfectly yesterday.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,Just remember the title of this review. You must drive the ball straight. There is OB on almost every hole. If your driver is on your score will reflect it.
Valle Vista Country Club,542-valle-vista-country-club,I'm a fan!
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Great pace of play and pretty good conditions. The greens were a bit sandy, and bumpy, but otherwise, good."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Plum Creek is a good local Indy course. The course was not crowded on a weekday afternoon. The course was in pretty good condition especially considering the lack of rain. There are some holes where it is difficult to navigate to the next hole. One downside was there were limited restroom facilities and drinking water available on the course.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Course was in really good condition. Course gets a lot play, but was surprised the pace was good (played in 4 hrs)."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"This course was a dandy. The staff was engaging and happy. The cart fellas great too and we we paired with another couple golfers and they were great! Course conditions were perfect, fairways plush, greens were fast and fair.! I will play again if it works…..😁😁😁"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Plenty of challenging holes, greens in good shape, and friendly staff. Not too overpriced for what it’s worth. Solid 4.5/5"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"played with my son and enjoyed a nice round. Course in good condition, rough is longer and thicker than I remember so makes it tougher. I don't like the increased rates but will continue to play there (just less often) as it's one of my favorites."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Golf course was in better condition than I anticipated. Course gets a lot of rounds, so pace of play can be a challenge at times. Yesterday the weather wasn’t great, so less players, and we played quickly. Even with some rain over the past couple of days, the greens were very firm. Overall, an enjoyable round of golf at a twilight rate."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Pace of play was a bit slow, but didn't usually have to wait too long. Course condition great and another great golfer teamed up with us!"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"played Plum Creek many time this summer and really enjoyed round with no one in front of in back of us! Course great shape impressed with sand as many courses terrible shape. Great people working there as we had cart issues and without even calling in, they came out and brought new cart!! I will be back!"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,We play Plum multiple times each year and always appreciate the condition it is in. It’s condition compares favorably to some of the private courses we play.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"The course was in superb condition. I played here years ago and remembered nothing about the course. Playing it again, the reason for my non-recollection became clear. There is nothing remarkable or noteworthy about the course. In fact, it’s boring! Further, the green to next tee directions are either non-existent or confusing. Many wrong turns for the unfamiliar player. Doubt I’ll play it again, especially at their greens fees."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"The course condition was superb! Better markings to the next tee boxes would be helpful on several holes. Being our first time, we had a few wring turns."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Course was in great condition and very playable. Women’s member foursome in front of us was playing verrrrrry slow with open holes ahead of them but never offered to let our fast threesome play through on a very hot day, extending our round by ~30 mins. No ranger on duty."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,I really like the layout of the course. It's challenging but fair. They have a great range and good facilities. The cost has risen significantly in the last few years which has lessened some of the appeal. But it's still one of my favorite layouts in the city.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Course is in great shape overall. As always, some bunkers are great and others are six sand pebbles from being concrete. Greens were very smooth and nice and fast; they always have great greens. Fairways are great too; not cut too tight and always well irrigated."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"The weird items from last year are the cheap looking green plywood garbage cans covers, the spray-painted hole signs, and using dirt instead of sand on the chipping green. Really disappointing to see these three distasteful changes from 2022. I would consider this course close in quality to Prairie View (albeit much easier and less competitive environment) but these choices are made as if it’s a standard municipal course on a tight budget, and shouldn’t be decisions made by one of the best public courses in Carmel."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Spend the money on legitimate wood structures (like prairie view does) and use sand in the chipping area, not dirt."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,3 generations playing together for a perfect evening.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Course was in good shape. Greens were rolling nice. Layout is pretty straight forward. They have a nice range and putting green for warming up. I’ll be back.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Course was average in terms of layout. Nothing spectacular. However, the fairways and greens were in great shape with the greens putting true and above average speed. Bar and Snack bar were very good, staff at check in was very friendly. Driving range and practice area were excellent. I would play here again, especially if I got the Golf Now price."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Overall, good experience. Greens a little slow for my liking."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Have played here before, but only in outings. So first time playing for score, I played the Blue tee's and enjoyed it very much, the pace of play was OK. The course layout has start that lends itself to slow play. One is a reachable par 4, two is a reachable par 5, and three is a par 3, after that it tends to spread out, and play was fine, so be patient at the start. The course was in exceptional shape, and the greens ran fast and true. Enjoyed the day and the play, look forward to going back soon."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Loved that they had a senior rate for over 55. Not a super long course l. White tees are very short. Blues were a good distance especially with very little roll because of the wet conditions. Greens had been aerated a week or two earlier but still rolled pretty well. Will play again in the summer
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"The greens were still showing much of the punching done earlier, putting was difficult and bumpy."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Booked a 4:00 tee time with my family to get a break from our current club and do something different. The clubhouse was very nice in appearance. Staff was friendly.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"We hopped in our carts and went to the practice green. The outdoor seating area had a group of guys sitting in a circle, yelling lots of obscenities. Employees were present, but not concerned… so we just took it as par for this course."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"We get to the first tee box, which is basically just a few feet from the front drive. Had to time our tee shots in between the numerous cars pulling out behind us. While we were teeing at our scheduled time, there were already two twosomes waiting for us to go off. We had a couple foursomes in front of us, so we weren’t to let the twosomes thru. However, we knew we’d have people pressuring us from behind all day. (The two twosomes could have been paired together.)"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"As for the layout, the cart paths and gold tees don’t jive. Almost made us wonder if they added the gold tees after the course was designed. If you are in a cart, just play the blues. You’ll find it’s more convenient and enjoyable. Especially on hole 11…"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"The course is in good shape, but the greens are too slow. This leads to less break on the greens so it’s less challenging. What was challenging, was navigating our putts thru all the ballmarks that weren’t fixed. A true shame for such a beautiful course that has obviously had a lot of care by the greenskeepers."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"We completed the front in just under 2 hours, but the back was really slow. We’d wait for clearance and then have to wait again, and again, on nearly every shot. We finished the back in 2.5 hours. The group in front of us left with one hole to go, so it might have been even longer."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"I played this course for the first times with some buddies, we had to start off on the 10th Tee box, no biggie. We finished 9 in about 1 1/2 hours then headed to play on the front. A staff member came out yelling at us to return and play the back 9 again which was never established. Regardless from the knowledge I have of the back after playing it twice, the course is in good condition but in my opinion the layout is just not good and extremely boring. There are too many different courses around the area for the same price/cheaper that are better, do not play here."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"I feel scammed and taken advantage of after my experience at Plum Creek. I reserved a twilight round with the intent to only get through 9 holes. However, Plum Creek allowed tee times to be reserved all while a men's league shotgun started the front 9 and a kids league shotgun started the back 9. We waited 20 mins to hit our first shot and by the time we got to our next shot a staff member told us to go back to the 16th and play from there. We finally called it quits after 2 and half hours and only being able to get through 6 holes...."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Needless to say my time and money were wasted by Plum Creeks ability to manage reservations. It is a good public course that I have played several times before, but I will not go back until they improve management."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Course was in very good condition for how dry it is. Greens are fast, and pin placement was challenging. Traps and fairways all great. The pace of play was absolutely terrible. 18 holes took us almost 6 hours. They had a men’s league going, and kept tee times close together. We waited 10-15 minutes to start every hole."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Beautiful work, of course, friendly staff and great people all around."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,aeration was expected but was worse aeration job I have ever seen. Course should be closed until greens are healed
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Love the course. Almost always in good shape. One thing is missing: a white - blue combination. The white is currently less than 6000 yds and the blue typically plays over 6400. A 6200+ yd combo would be ideal for many players.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Fun course for all skill levels. would be nice if there was a course calendar showing events, tournaments and leagues play"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"What a fun course. Overall, probably the best conditions I've seen this season. As usual, Pete Dye greens run fast and true. Unfortunately, my fellow golfers there are not terribly diligent about repairing ball marks. I played a mix of blue and white. The gap in overall yardage (on the card) is about 500 yards, which is a lot with 5 tees."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"My husband and I enjoyed our ""date"" for a round of golf! Perfect weather and the course was in great condition."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Paired with nice young man, Josh. I'm a senior, and the front 9 all teed off from the ladies (tee boxes were being aerated. After a difficult first hole, my game steadily improved. The trailing single player, Jake, joined us for a 3-some on the back 9. Jake was very nice too, and my game continued to improve. Josh and Jake played the whites, I played the gold. Had a great time for an all-time bests 94. I'll definitely go back to Plum Creek, hopefully before the season is over."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Front nine tees were being aerated, all tees were at the front (ladies) tee (I played the golds!)"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Opened back up o back 8. Had a 45 for 27 hole score of 9; - zero lost balls! I’ll be back!
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,No question we had a lot of rain last week. I get it. But by Monday all of the flood trash on the golf course should have been picked up. Tuesday there should have been a lot of mowing going on. I saw NONE. THE ROUGH is ridiculously high all over the course. Th e bunkers were untouched. Trash from the flooding was everywhere. What is going on????
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Can’t tell you the number of times I’ve played on Saturday and had unacceptable delays. The Men’s group shows up with more players than tee times. 8-12 players call and want to play. Sure throw them in after the Men’s group too bad, the rest of us can wait. This Saturday it was the owner’s relatives playing in a five some at 10:30!! Watched some wiff 4 times before hitting the ball!!!!! The course needs better care. Don’t think anyone in management gets in a cart and goes out to inspect the playing conditions. Too bad, it could be so much better."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Truly a fun course where every hole is unique to the eye and presents a challenge, a different chapter in the book of the round. The front 9 is tighter with more damage done on missed fairways, the back 9 is relatively easy except for 16, 17, and 18. These 3 are anxiety inducing if you're looking at a great round so far."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"The practice area is remarkable; great putting, chipping and full range."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"The course drains well after rains. It's not the easiest course to walk/push cart but with not much elevation change, it's not bad at all."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Staff is always friendly and looking out for you. Occasionally they have marshalls to keep pace of play going on busier days. Food is really good (get the chicken quesadilla). Love this place!
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"This course is always top notch. We have been playing at Plum for years and never had a bad experience. Friendly staff, course conditions are good and 18 holes always takes 3.5-4 hours. Can’t ask for much more."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Loved the course greens rolled true, firm but not hard, able to put spin on the ball, fast greens, fairway cut beautifully, great reward if you hit the fairway, front 9 seemed to play a little tighter than the back 9 in my opinion, not super difficult but you can still be put in some sticky situations if you can’t find your swing that day"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Course, wonderful shape. Earlier 8:21am twosome tee time, got paired with two “seniors” pace of play was horrendous. Felt bad for holding up the two foursomes behind us most of the morning… disappointed in the pace due to this but I understand pairing up but at least make an effort to make the skill level comparable or at least at an acceptable rate of play. Paid too much money to play at a higher end course to get the same problems when ya play somewhere 1/2 the price"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"the course was in great shape and our foursome was able to get around in 3 hours 45 minutes. unfortunately, that pace wasn't fast enough for the four members behind us. the two members of our group who had never seen plum creek felt rushed most of the round. other than that, great time on a great course."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Greens were perfect and course was in better shape than prairie view across the street and 15 percent cheaper
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Plum Creek is almost always in great condition. It’s early yet, so the rough is a little long as we’ve gotten a fair amount of rain and they can’t mow as often."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"I love the course/facility. There was a women’s collegiate event and they were ridiculously slow. We started 20 minutes late, played the first two holes in about 45 minutes and when we got to the third tee, there were already four groups waiting."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Great layout and condition! Friendly staff. Winds made round interesting and challenging. Smooth greens.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Plum Creek has been a favorite for many years! I am never disappointed. The regular members are always friendly and welcoming to the public players! And the course (Pete Dye design) is challenging but very open and forgiving. A great track.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Kudos to staff for having course open on first open weather window of the year. Conditions were rough from standpoint of bunkers and greens. Understandably so given time of year. Lowe green fees were appreciated. Cartpath restriction earned me a couple if miles extra walking back and forth across fairways. Looking forward to another round when it’s not so windy, the greens are not so bumpy, and players I’m paired with are a bit more my demeanor. Joe was super, even ran back to previous bunker to get my 7-iron. He was done at the turn though. The other two dudes I was paired with were a hoot. At least they gave me one of their Mango Seltzers!"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Great course to play! Ready for the spring to come so greens can speed up and practice can be done on actual grass and not mats.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Nice layout, good condition except for the greens which were still aerated and sanded."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Good conditions, ok pace of play, and decent price for non members… always a good (albeit) slower round."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Pace of play Was there on the front nine. We got to the back nine and it took us 45 to get through two holes due to it being backed up. We pulled up to 12 and had two groups in front of us. We called into the pro shop to see if we could get a rain check because we couldn’t spend three or four hours in the back nine, which they told us to come to the clubhouse. Upon getting to the clubhouse they were very quick to tell us they didn’t make any money off GolfNow and that we would not be getting any rain checks. The pros name was Andy and we were representing a group of 75 guys hopping around Central in Annapolis joining new courses with a membership. I can tell you after we walked out everyone agreed that this would be crossed off the list. In all honesty we would’ve been fine with it but the way Andy handled the situation was very poor and unprofessional."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Beautiful course friendly staff but pace of play can be slow. No ranger on course
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,First time playing and was very impressed. Clubhouse staff was super friendly and knowledgeable. Course was in great shape and pace of play was great. Definitely coming back here when I’m in the area.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Go here instead of prairie view much better layout and not even comparable in price. As someone that just started golfing this course is challenging enough to make you better but not enough to overwhelm you. Frustratingly fun!
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Very enjoyable course. Great fairways and greens roll very true. Small greens but great. Back 9 is challenging due to more hazards.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Great course!! Would be nice for all golfers to respect course
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Extremely friendly staff and club members! The course was impeccably maintained and had your typical Pete Dye challenges. I can't wait to go back.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Plum Creek is an awesome course that I play often. The only thing I would improve is spacing the tee times out a little more and placing a starter at the first tee to regulate tee times and ensure that groups aren’t too close.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"For March golf in Indy the course was in impeccable shape. Greens rolled well, fairways and tee boxes in great shape. Somebunkers needed a little tlc, but like I said it’s March."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Had no idea it was a Pete Dye course, and that explains a lot of things! I usually keep tabs on designers, especially notable ones I like, but was busy and didn’t look into it. The course overall was in excellent shape, challenging and but not a lot of elevation changes."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"There is a creek that runs throughout the land and a good number of lakes that come into play. After the first hole, you cross over a small road to play the rest of the front nine. The tee box on six is relatively close to a VERY busy street. Beware a giant hook that could cross into four lanes of traffic! You come back over that small road to the property to play the back nine. It was a warm Saturday, so the course was crowded and did lead to a pretty slow round."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"With so many other Dye courses around the area, I guess it isn’t as well known. However, it is a strong course you should try out."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Staff was friendly course was in great shape for the dry weather we have been experiencing.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Deceiving pricing after 5pm. They book the heck of the place after 5pm to trick people that they can 18, but actually I’m waiting at each tee box 10 minutes waiting for the people in front of us and the people in front of them. MAKE TEE TIME BEFORE 4PM"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Best public course in the area for the players who want a challenge, but the ability to score well too. I played the tips which make the course much longer, but you can score really well from whites or blues. I wish they had a starter out more often to pick up pace of slower groups especially during peaking times. This is my go to course locally."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"while not the most prominent of Pete Dye’s designs, Plum Creek is a great track, maintained in A+ condition!"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"the bent grass greens roll true, with enough undulation to make you consider your line.the Staff is friendly and helpful.. Tom is your go-to Guy !"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"First time playing this course, had my 74 year old dad and his friends down. Great layout and fantastic greens/pin locations. Was a super rainy day but course held the water and played a full 18. Would recommend over and over again."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Booked through GolfNow so great value. Course was in good condition. Pace of play was good.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,This course is absolutely wonderful. Nice big greens but not a lot of room to miss the green. The tall grass will eat you up if you can't stay out of it! Fairways and greens are in great shape despite the course clearly being played regularly by a large amount of players. The real prize for this course is the twighlight rate is unbeatable! You will not find a course that is so pristine for less. Value is what brings me back and it will continue to do so!
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"The course stretches over a large area of land and they did a great job utilizing all of it. Course is very open and forgiving off the tee, but keep it in fairway or you’ll play out of thick rough. Same around the green- pin positions were enticing to hit a perfect shot , but leaving short will make for a difficult chip from the rough. All around great course with good pace of play"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Nice layout. Easy course if you are driving the ball good.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"The course was beautiful. Greens were nearly perfect. They were quick, difficult, and sometimes deceiving. It was a nice challenge. The course is designed to be easy if you do not make mistakes, but will punish you greatly for mistakes that you make. I personally love this type of a course. The roughs were thick enough to make them difficult, but not overgrown. The entire course (fairways/greens/rough) was great accept for some of the bunkers that I did find on the back that did not seem to be raked. The one disappointment was the inaccuracy of the playing distances. I am not a long ball hitter (Drive about 240 yards), so the blue tees were looking great. I like to plan ahead on how to play a hole, and when I stepped up and teed off from a par 4 that is listed as 428 yards and then realize they have changed some of their tee positions and the actual distance was now 492 yards, there is some frustration. Do not trust the score card on distances. They have also added and removed some bunkers that may be on their map or your GPS, but these have changed. Make note of this when checking distances and planning your shot."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Great round at one of my favorite courses. The day was a bit chilly and windy, but the course did not disappoint. Tees, fairways, greens and even traps in beautiful condition. Was not crowded, did not wait and got around quickly. Just a great day."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Greens were beautifully cut and fairways were firm and forgiving. Watch out for water on some holes and score away! Great overall course!
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,ProsStaff checking inDid not pair us up3/12 hour roundGreens fastFairways tight but goodConsVery fewPin positions set on a lot of humpsBunkers need a little more sand
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Greens are great, fairways are great, driving range was great."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Plum Creek has become my new favorite course.Staff is always friendly and helpfulGreens are well maintained
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Fun course with strategically placed bunkers and fast greens would recommend!
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Pace was slowBut spring day was the main attraction
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"The course is very nice but poorly marked, if and when you found any markings at all for yardage. ALL staff are very friendly, great value, I just used an app on my phone for yardage."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,The course was in great shape and the pace was under 4 hours.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"We liked the course including the layout and the greens and the pace of play was too slow, seemingly because of only 5 minute intervals between groups. I would love to see a ranger in the course as it usually is just one group that falls 2 or 3 holes behind and jams up the whole course like today, we had. foursome in front of us who were being held up on almost every hole by a group in front of them. Not sure. If a group was holding them up or not."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Obviously, with Covid, golf courses became a place of refuge. Thank goodness! Course had become somewhat overplayed although it held up well in what I'm sure was their business year ever. Hopefully, once Covid is back under control, Plum could make some small changes to improve play. First, watch the pace of play. Too many times this summer, major back-ups happened due to one slow foursome that never seemed to get pushed. No sense to have to take five hours for a round of golf, which happens too often. Second, put out some little signs on the course to ""Fix Your Divot"". Way too many divots never repaired and greens took a beating. Third, move the tee boxes with a little more frequency....some areas became way too beat up. Fourth, put some sand back in the bunkers. Too many bunkers had virtually NO sad in the 2nd half of the year.....and then make sure they are cleaned up each day. Just some thoughts....fun course, local course, always enjoy it!"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Plum Creek is not Pete Dye's tallest task, but it packs a punch. The greens always roll well even though the course gets tons of play. The staff is very professional. The course is pretty easy to walk. It is overpriced for what it is, but this is to be expected with north side golf. I always look forward to playing out here."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Plum Creek is an under appreciated course in Carmel. This Pete Dye design isn't as tricked up as some like the brickyard, but it offers all golfers a good challenge. Birdies can be made at plum creek, but there are lots of hazards to made double bogey or worse come into play. The course is in a beautiful neighborhood. The staff is always friendly and the accommodations are excellent. I think the course is overpriced for what it is, but this is north side golf so this is to be expected. I love playing Plum Creek, and the course is pretty easy to walk!"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Some of the fairways were hard but we haven't had much rain in weeks. Tee boxes and greens were in great shape.Tee time from Golf now did not match what they had in their system so I was late. Staff was very friendly and got me in with another group.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Course in great shape and provided me a challenge for only my second time playing there.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Love the course, love the layout, love the greens, love the bar and food, only thing I really can complain about, most of the time 4 hours is not enough time to play 18 holes, and all too often, 5 hours is not enough. I would love to see a ranger in the course as it usually is just one group that falls 2 or 3 holes behind and jams up the whole course! like today, we had. foursome in front of us and, although they were pretty slow, they were being held up on almost every hole by a twosome in front of them!!! a TWOSOME!! by the 13-14 holes we realized this twosome had fallen a full two holes behind thr group in front of them that had teed off just 10 mins before they did."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Wonderful conditioned course. It is in stellar shape for this time of year. The course is challenging, but fair. Love playing Plum Creek and I will be back."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,This is a Pete Dye design...and...you get all the tricks of his tracks here. No need to spend hundreds elsewhere...it’s all here. The course is very well maintained. I could quibble with bunkers with little sand...but....I won’t. The course is very pretty. This is a busy course...but...the pace of play is excellent. About 3hrs 20 min for my twosome. The clubhouse is nice. The staff is nice. The driving range is very nice as well. Overall...I have nothing bad to say ( except for the sand in bunker non-quibble).
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Excellent conditions and layout. Greens rolled true.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Hot & humid day but the course was in good shape.Pete Dye greens are difficult to read and haven't played there enough recently to remember all the breaks. Enjoyed the round.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,This was my first time playing here and it will not be the last. The course was in great shape and definitely a challenge.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"My husband & I played with another couple. When we called for tee times we were told 9 holes (with cart) $30. When my husband & the other guy checked in, neither ask for a receipt. (Our big mistake) we had only played 3 holes, when weather turned bad. We ask for rain check. The course was very crowded and so was the patio area. No one practicing social distancing. PLUM CREEK NEVER ALERTED THE GOLFERS ABOUT THE WEATHER. No horn, or siren. When we got home my husband got a bank alert and noticed we were charged $140. He called the next day and was told there is no price difference between 9 holes & 18 holes. That was not what we were told. Plum Creek deducted 3 holes from our rain check. My advice make sure you talk to someone who knows the correct info. Poor customer relations."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,The only 4 star for amenities is due to the Corona virus.Very interesting course and layout. Well taken care of. All employees pleasant and helpful.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Awesome course but way way way too many players book ed too close together guys coming off the back nine right in front of us pace of play nauseatingly slow other than that great course
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"The course was in excellent condition and the layout of the course, the difficulty level and beauty of the course were all outstanding. Well worth the money. Will definitely be back."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"This was my first time playing Plum Creek after wanting to play it for the last couple of years. Overall, the tee boxes and fairways were in incredible shape. I only had a couple of complaints about the course: 1) the greens look healthy, but rolled really slow. My brother-in-law and I had issues all day getting the speed of the greens down. They looked like they should roll a lot faster. 2) More yardage markers on the course would be extremely helpful for people who don't play here often. Either that, or GPS in the carts. Other than that, really enjoyed the layout and will definitely be playing here again this summer!"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Challenging enough to keep it entertaining but still open enough for the average golfer. Will be coming back.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"I played in a foursome on Saturday 5/30. We teed off at 4PM and while the course was busy we never felt rushed and never had to wait to tee off. The course was in SUPERB condition. This was my first round since corona virus so it was nice to get outside and get a round in. I was able to hit a bucket of balls and get in some putting practice prior to our round, which is always nice."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,The weather was perfect.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"One small gripe is the amount of tall fescue type grass that is around the course specifically around the greens. I hit two balls that landed on the green and rolled into the tall grass and it is extremely difficult to find once it is in there unless you get lucky. With that said, I decided how to approach certain shots because of that, which adds to the challenge which, in my opinion, is a good thing. Our foursome was able to finish 18 in about 3:45."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Staff in the pro-shop was friendly and helpful. I bought a new glove and some tees. Downstairs in the bar I had some homemade trail mix (the addition of dried bananas is a revelation!) and packed up a 6 pack of white claws.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,I would love to come back again - thanks!
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"I would say this is a great place to play if you are interested in having a nice easy round. It is hard to lose a ball in the front 9, if you are too aggressive on the back it can punish you. Well, kept and forgiving in general, the rough is tough but fair - don't try to blast out with a hybrid, it will grab that club. Some greens are challenging in a good way."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"If I have a complaint, it is that the on course information is severely lacking. If I hadn't been playing with a resident, I'd have had a hard time knowing where to go for the next tee. For 70 bucks, I'd expect at least a 150 yard marker, but distance markers are non-existent."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Course is nice to play but staff was not friendly and very slow checking in.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"The course is green, lush, and well-manicured! Fantastic overall. The greens were a bit slow compared to normal, presumably in part due to the recent aeration - expect greens to be in great shape in a couple of days."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Booked my tee time and got a confirmation. The morning of golf golf now told me that time was not available. This was my first experience with golf now. Not good
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"I understand it is January and you don’t normally get a lot of play this time of year. But, when you get a couple of weekend days in the 50’s you should know you are going to get some activity. There were no tee markers on the tee boxes. So you just had to guess where you should play from. This course has some holes that are very tricky to find. Better markings on WHERE the next hole is would be nice. Generally the course was in pretty good shape. The greens were pretty shaggy, but I guess that is to be expected in January."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Course layout was just ok for the Dye courses I have played. Conditions were great for a winter round. The problem I had was the very poor pace of play and the fact that I was forced to play with someone else whose golf etiquette was horrible. I would have loved to rate the course higher but too many things were not up to snuff.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,This was my first time playing at Plum Creek and I was shocked I waited this long to get a round in there. The course is designed in a way that is very friendly to the golfer. Only lost 3 balls all round (two were off the same tee box lol). The difficulties rely on the golfer being consistent with ball striking more than the natural course challenges of other places I’ve played. Excited to go back and get some birdies!
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,If you driver right handed and constantly slice your shot you will love this course.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Enjoyed round very much. Watch greens - very hard and tough to keep ball on them!!
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"This time of the year greens still have aeration holes so keep that in mind, besides that good condition for time of the year. Clubhouse and facilities were closed due to covid so I can’t comment on any of those things"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Great course in Carmel. Course conditions were great and pin placement was somewhat friendly. The deep rough was well, rough. Challenging yet fun."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Everything about this place is excellent. The only thing possible negative is lazy golfers not fixing ball marks on green not fault of golf course. We will be back6
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Beautiful autumn day. Course in great shape. Finished in 2:20 - first one out. Worth the time to play. Too bad season is ending. See you in the spring.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,I would like to play it again without the greens being aerated.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Very hot and humid but course is in good condition.Very slow due to a slow 4-some but got through on 10 and was wide open the rest of the way probably because of some people quitting after 9 due to the heat. Glad 4-some stopped for lunch, they had fallen 2 1/2 holes behind and didn't let a 2-some through. We had 4 and the twosome finished 3 holes behind us after they snuck through at 10 also. Slow 4some was way back..Just a word to other golfers. If you aren't keeping up with the group in front of you then LET faster players play through. It's like driving 10mph under the speed limit in the FAST lane and hanging out there."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"They maintain this course very well. Staff is outstanding and there are numerous challenges, even for the very skilled golfer."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Well maintained, friendly staff. Very good Orange Whips."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"I play golf rarely and look for value. I received a discount for this course and would play the course again for this price. The condition of the course was good. The greens were chewed up quite a bit and had ball marks all over the surface. It was my first time on the course and the layout from hole to hole can be a little confusing. I ended up hitting the same clubs all day and it seemed like each par four was very similar. The fairways were firm and I got a lot of roll on the my drives. I appreciated that! The practice facility is really nice and the putting green had the same speed as the course greens. Overall, the course was enjoyable and the value was there!"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Had the opportunity to play the course early in the season, excellent layout, great greens, fun time with buddies."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Course was in excellent condition for this time of year. Practice putting area and separate bunker and chipping area are excellent. The driving range allowed the use of mats only which I did not care for. Staff very friendly and helpful .
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Great golf course and look forward to playing it again in the spring and summer.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Not sure why clubhouses partner singles with doubles. If I wanted a threesome I would beg my wife. A 3 hour round turned into a 4 hour round. The course was fine and in excellent shape. I understand the short term business decision to maximize your profits by placing players together. However, its not good for the long term."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,The course the greens everything was beautiful and perfect we will play it again
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,My wife and I played this course for the first time. We enjoyed it and would play it again. Pace of play was slow but that's to be expected on a nice Sunday afternoon. Tee to green the course was in good shape!
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Got a good deal with GN and my buddy and I played here for my first time. It was chilly , but not bad for this time of year. Had alot of rain the night before and it was paths only."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Pace was good as there was only a foursome in front of us and didn't hold us up too bad.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Greens were fair for the time of year also.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Course is in great shape. Most holes are very challenging. Nice layout. Staff is quite accomadating. It was a little cool today, but pace of play good maybe because of temp. Love this course, always look forward to a round at Plum Creek. Probably wouldn't play unless I got a good price on GolfNow, but well worth 25-30 bucks."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Plum Creek is always in great shape and well run. It isn’t a long course (around 5700 yds from the whites), but the water and long grass off the fairways make it challenging for beginning and experienced golfers."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"You usually get paired up into a foursome, and all the players have been fun to golf with."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,The clubhouse and bar area are very nice.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Got a great deal on Golf Now. Great course. Glad I could play there before winter.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"My personal favorite course in the Indy/Carmel area. I like to golf in the fall. prices fall with the leaves. crowds are less so a faster round is possible. played in a bit over 3 hours, walking.try this course and remember to look closely on the greens. they can be subtly tricky."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"This was the first time my son and I played here. My husband had, and recommended it. Staff was very friendly. Course is in very nice condition. Layout is varied. We will be back."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,The course was in perfect shape and has a great layout.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Had a great time. Very well maintained. Not the most challenging course but a very solid course.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"I’ll start off by saying in over 20 years of golf I had never played here because I always heard it was overpriced for what you get. I was a long time member at Pebble Brook and frequently played Bear Slide, Purgatory and Prairie View. I was a scratch golfer back then but I am currently a 5 handicap. I have also worked at multiple golf courses including Purgatory and Gator Creek in Sarasota, Fl. The reason I tell you all that is because I grew up around the game, played at a high level and worked at multiple courses over a long period of time and I have never once seen anyone kicked off a course. I’ve seen some pretty dumb things done on golf courses but none of those things led to being removed from the course. There was a one time warning and that was the end of it."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"That being said, about 3 months back a friend invited me to join the Wednesday night men’s league at Plum Creek so I decided I’d give it a chance. I enjoyed the format and the people in the league. I’ve made some good friends and ended up making Plum Creek my regular course because many of the league players I’ve become friends with are members there."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"A few weeks ago I went out with my daughter, a friend of mine and his kids. On #9(our last hole) my friend made a hole in one. It was late and we played until dark but as the tradition goes, my buddy had to buy everyone a drink at the clubhouse. The bar is supposedly open until 10 but on this night the bartender had closed out her drawer at 9:45. We walked in at 9:48, literally. Instead of reopening the drawer she refused drinks for a MEMBER(even though we were paying cash) and refused to even put the cash in an envelope and ring it in the next day as I suggested. I don’t think I need to explain how this decision took away from probably the most exciting moment my friend has ever, and probably will ever, experience while playing golf."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Moving on to today, I head out to play with the same friend again. We arrive a few minutes before our tee time. I keep a bottle/flask of fireball, as many golfers do, in my bag. We were rushing to the tee so I did not have time to grab a drink from the clubhouse as I usually do. Right before teeing off I decided to take a quick swig of my fireball in my bag. I go to tee off and next thing I know, Mark comes out from the club and asked me if I “snuck liquor onto the course”. I said “I don’t know about sneaking but yes I do have a bottle in my bag.” He then tells me that I can either give him the bottle and if it ever happens again I won’t be welcome back, or I can get a refund and leave. I gave him the bottle and he agreed to let me play and give me the bottle when we leave. Problem solved right? Wrong. As we were walking back to our carts from the first green Mark is waiting. He decides to go back on what we agreed upon just a few minutes earlier and informs me that I have to leave. I attempted to reason with him but he wasn’t hearing it. I went inside and left without incident. Did I mention that it is not posted anywhere that you are not allowed to bring your own liquor or beer and that there was no beverage cart on the course and many times there isn’t?"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"So... if you are a regular customer(or even a member) that plays at Plum Creek 3 times a week on average and spends $1,000’s on merchandise, beer, food, range balls and greens fees don’t expect to get any kind of respect or decent treatment from the management at this place."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Although the course is a Pete Dye course, that’s about where the positives end. Not all Pete Dye courses are equal that’s for sure. The greens are always covered with divots and from one day to the next they will putt entirely different. I always made a point to repair mine plus one more and many times two or three more. The tee boxes aren’t even close to level either and on at least half the holes you will not find a level spot to tee off that’s not chewed up. Outside of the greens the course is pretty well maintained but the two most important places are poor at best."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"So to summarize, if you want to play off of side hill lies from the tees, putt on the surface of the moon and get treated like crap for spending your hard earned money at a “top” course then by all means head on over to Plum Creek! I assure you I’ve spent my last dollar there."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Second time playing this course. The first time it was very wet. The course is straightforward and playable, yet challenging and fun. Pace of play was good. Conditions were good. Only slight negative is looks like members aren't great at fixing ball marks on greens. Some were a little bumpy."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,I enjoyed my round met three good guys . I enjoyed the challenge and it was in great condition . The staff was very professional and course had excellent practice facility’s.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Thais is a Pete Dye course. All the usual tricks associated with Pete Dye courses are here. I didn’t care for it myself but if it’s your thing...this is the course. The course was in excellent condition. Very well maintained . The value is not there for me though. At a $60 rack rate I expect GPS carts, restrooms on the course, and a snack cart. The place had none of that. Since I didn’t like the PEte Dye tricks the course is not worth the price for me to play again. Good lick to all those who do ."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"We 3 could not have played a better day on a very nice course! No one in front of us for entire round. Sand in bunkers was good and greens were still wet ,but quick. If you get the opportunity to play this course,take it for i know we will!"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Excellent value. Course was in fantastic condition with greens fast and true. Excellent layout with some challenging holes. Played the course two days in a row on my first visit to Indy, and would play again in the future."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,One of the reasons I love playing Plum creek is because they are always improving and maintaining the course. Best public cours you can play in the Carmel area in my opinion.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Great course, just the right amount of challenge from the blue tees for a 12 handicapper. Love playing there, but typically price gets in the way. Thank you Golf Now for making it a great day for my group - at a very favorable price point."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Thank you Plum Creek for posting a golf time at a great rate on Golfnow! The course was in excellent shape. The staff was very accommodating. Brand new carts. Pace of play was excellent. I had a great time and look forward to going back again!
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Course was in beautiful shape. Booked a solo round on golf now and was paired with 3 other guys. The group I played in was great, and the course was a blast. The greens were in good shape and rolled pretty quick. The course layout is fantastic. It’s pretty open and pretty hard to lose a ball. There are plenty of different tee boxes for different skill levels of golfers. Pace of play was great. The outdoor patio was filled with people watching golf on tv. What a day to spend on the golf course. I’ll be back."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"This course is popular as it sits in the middle of carmel. In every experience at this course, pace of play has been an issue."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"I would also never play this course without a golf now deal. The standard rates are just too high for what you get. People pay it, so you can’t blame them."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Fun track, true greens that can play quick in right conditions, great condition but SLOW pace of play. Expect a 5 hour round if you don’t get out early."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Great course. Via GolfNow, our rates of $3/ea made this a great deal. The course condition was great-no bare spots. I hope to return soon and often this summer."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,My dad and I met up for a quick 18 with a cart around 5:45. Played the front side twice in under 3 hours with cart. I would recommend this course to any and everyone
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"This is probably one of the best courses in Central Indiana. It's a bit expensive so I only play once in a while. It's always in perfect condition. Course layout isn't super difficult but the greens are very hard (at least for me), you can easily end up three putting if you don't take your time."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"We had two tee times reserved for a total of six guys. A group of four teed off and then was followed by our other two who were paired with another couple. After hole #1, the other couple(who was not with us) suggested that our two guys play through to join the rest of us. From hole #2 on we played as a six-some, regularly waiting on the group in front of us. The two-some behind us did not wait on us at any point on the front nine. We made the turn and were having a great time. Once we finished #10, a gentleman came by and asked us why we were playing all together. We calmly explained our reasoning and encouraged him to ask the couple behind if we were slowing them down. He did not even listen to what we had to say. He demanded firmly that we split up for the remainder of the round. We did as he asked but the remainder of the back nine was ridiculously long. We waited in every fairway and tee for the foursome in front of us, which in turn cause our two-some to wait in addition to the couple behind them. I am all about keeping pace of play appropriate but what the gentleman did lacked commonsense and resulted in a poor experience from #10 on."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Plum creek is a quality golf club and has a very solid layout for all of their holes. I had a wonderful time playing the course again and found the course to be in excellent condition for this time of year. I am always impressed with the staff and with the amenities the course offers and was pleased to have the opportunity to play in the afternoon. I do plan to be back as I really enjoy this golf course. Highly recommended.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,I’ve always enjoyed playing at Plum Creek. Love the layout and the conditions are always very good. On this day the greens were a little bumpy but that’s to be expected early in the season especially with the cold weather and delayed spring. Will be back as often as I can. Love this track.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Course was open but driving range was closedGreens were slow and bumpy. To be expected for March golf
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Course was in pretty good conditions after 4 inches of rain the previous week. I was surprised how playable the course was, was first day it was opened. Greens in pretty good shape."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"nice sunny 52 degrees for that close to xmas course in nice shape, always fun at this site"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Course was in incredible shape for this late in the season. Plum Creek always goes out of their way to give you a CC feel and amenities are always top notch. The course, while a bit short from the whites has a great balance between being challenging, but also playable... which keeps rounds (even when busy) at 4 hrs or less. Lastly, PC isn't afraid to discount rates which other neighboring courses don't do. Much appreciated for a father of 4."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Played on Sunday morning, with threat of rain and pretty windy (it did sprinkle a bit off and on). Great price on GolfNow."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"We had rain earlier in the week, so the course was in very good shape, especially considering it's Nov. Tees were grassed well, pretty flat. Fairways, rough and bunkers were all in great condition. Greens are probably some of the more consistent you will find around here; very fair, smooth, fit the course very well. You'll find a lot of Pete Dye's favorites here, so slicers beware. I'd categorize most landing areas as fair, so you can get the ball in play. Most of the greens are elevated, so while a few holes are pretty short, the approach is trickier. We played the blues, and with the wind, we had a few longer approach shots in. The par 5s are pretty gettable, and the par 3s are mostly tame. I enjoyed a few holes more than others, #1 is a fun opener, risk/reward; #4 is a solid hole with a split fairway, a creek thru the middle; #7 is a tough hole into the wind. The closing stretch is fun, with #16 a longer par 3, #17 a par 5 over the lake and #18 around the same lake again. (no slicing allowed here, pick your spot on 17 tee with caution!)."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Conditions were very solid, made the course very fun. I wouldn't call this one of Pete's best, but consistency matters. I think they get a fair amount of play, so they are doing the right things putting some money into the super's hands. I'll definitely be back, I played pretty bad on the back nine, so paybacks are in order!"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Plum Creek is a course that a player can score well. Challenging but not hard for the average golfer. Every time I've played the course, it's been in excellent conditions. Fairways cut, greens quick and the rough is grass, not weeds.The staff is extremely friendly, from the guys in the pro shop to the girls that work in the snack area.Good practice facility, they have balls available to chip and good putting greens for practice.Outdoor lounge and TVs to catch up on golf, football or baseball games."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Fairways are excellent, greens are fast, a great challenging course for a beginner but a fair course. My foursome loved it!"
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Beautiful course, great greens. Whole course is nice, 17 and 18 are spectacular. Excellent chipping area next to putting area. Easily a four star."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Other people are slow, I get it. But when the pro shop can’t or won’t do anything about it - lost a a star. Members playing behind us were frustrated (not with us) and quit after nine because of the slow play. Apparently this isn’t the first time."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Course is nice and well kept. Not overly interesting but nice. Pace of play is as bad as you’ll see anywhere, and the staff could care less."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"Plum Creek is 5 minutes from where I live. I play it often and I am never disappointed. It has lots of challenging holes, yet is fairly forgiving. The greens are great. I like many of the great courses around Indy, and Plum Creek ranks right up there with all of them."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"From Tee to Green the course was very good. However, the greens were awful. Very, Very slow and quite bumpy. A lot of un-repaired ball marks. No GPS. For the price charged, there should be GPS on carts. The day I played, the course was only worth about $25 per round - I paid $35 + Golf Now fee."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Enjoyed playing. 1st cut rough a little long. Need better distance markings. 100/150/200.
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,"It's a challanging and forgiving at the same time, one of the hallmarks of a Dye course. The first thing you have to understand is the course is heavily played. They have a large Membership and lots of local regulars, as well as pulling from all over the state. That said they do a great job keeping the fairways, rough and bunkers in sharp all summer. The greens can be hit or miss. Typically they roll about medium speed, and there's lot of subtle breaks. There are commonly a lot of ball marks, it's frustrating when golfers don't repair their marks but it's really bad here. There's a lot of risk/reward options so you can play the course different ways. There's water on probably half the holes, a creek runs through the property and there's several large ponds on the back nine. The pace of play isn't terrible but but it's not fast, especially on the weekends. And you can get stuck behind a ""social"" group that's more interested in seeing thier neighbors than playing golf. Overall it's a great experience, I play it regularly and I highly recommend it."
Plum Creek Golf Club,5672-plum-creek-golf-club,Course is in great shape and continues to be tough on me. I'll still keep coming back!
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Great conditions and weather! But watch out for the mean lady on hole 6, according to her she will shoot somebody."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,played the two oldest 9 holes. had not played course in a couple of years. thought greens rolled very well as well as fairways. no complaints.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,This course is always very well maintained. It’s a fun course for all level of golfers. Place of play has not been an issue. I’ll definitely be back.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,We played in three hours and 45 minutes. The greens were in excellent condition even though there had been rain recently. This course always plays well and holds up very well when many other courses are cartpath only or closed.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Course is in good shape. Pace was slow on first 9 and then fast on the second. We didn’t feel welcome on the course though. None of the people we encountered made us feel like they wanted us there. Plenty of other options so I doubt we are back anytime soon.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"The fairways were in great shape. The greens were in great shape, the rough would penalize you"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Great winter golf at the Legends. Ron the starter was very accommodating.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Fairways was in great shape, green are in great shape, the rough would make you pay a price"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Numerous challenges, but not terribly difficult. Course was in great condition as always. You will enjoy your round IF you play the right tees."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,we played The Legends on a windy Nov. day. there are a lot of new houses(with new OB). Course in very good condition. Everyone was great to us.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"I'll never play The Legends Golf Club again. The starter was very rude to me and my guest, his treatment of customers is not acceptable. I run a small business and if any of my employees ever spoke to a customer, the way we were treated by the starter, I'd fire them on the spot. I've played too many public courses and some fantastic private courses around Indy to ever have to put up with a rude starter, and I just won't accept rude treatment when I'm the customer. This starter didn't ask us to move our cart, he could have easily said excuse me sir, do you mind moving or even said ""please"", but NO, he skipped polite asking nicely or even asking at all and went straight to giving orders/ commands, demands telling us to move our cart and when I looked at him in disbelief as he came flying up to us, he then goes onto say: ""I'll have your privileges taken away."" The only thing I said to him the entire time he was barking orders at us was that I don't want to ever play here again. I told him our tee time and we left. I paid for 2 rounds on golfnow but that's fine at least golfnow gets something, I like to support good companies. So, I went home and picked up my son and we went to a different course to hit balls, chip, and putt and enjoy the beautiful day. I was happy I even had time to mow the grass so the day wasn't wasted. So many great choices for golf around central Indiana to ever waste your time and money going to The Legends Golf Club. I've got a few buddies with similar experiences here also with a mean / nasty range/ starter, maybe it's time they look into this and hire some new folks that treat Customers with a smidge of respect. I'll be 100% sure to tell everyone I play with in the two golf leagues I play in and the other league I sub in, as well as, my weekend group I play with about my experience at The Legends Golf Club, I think I have a complete email list also to all the members at Old Oakland Golf Club too from when I was a member there, but I doubt they'd care about a public course like The Legends, but I'll let them know too just in case. Play anywhere besides The Legends Golf Club is my best advice for every and All Golfers!"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Nice balance of challenging holes and gettable holes! Water, elevation and bunkers are well placed and demand consideration"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"27 holes of golf, all well cared for. Practice facilities are top notch. Not very difficult but scores have to be earned. I enjoyed playing here for third time this year."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Always enjoy playing the Legends.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,The course is always in great shape and a pleasure to play.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Don't come to this place unless you are super good at golfing. We played in a reasonable pace as amateurs, but we were rushed on every holes by the ranger. When we finished 9 holes, the ranger told us that we have to finish the 9 holes in two hours, otherwise, he is going to remove us from the course. We felt this is rude. We paid to play the course as friends together, just for a relaxed game and having some fun. This course is definitely not for that. Stay away from it."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,You can always count on this course being in good shape.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"I live an hour north of Legends, but I was happy that I made the drive. Great Pete Dye layout, friendly staff, and friendly people on the course. It is still early in the year and the grasses are not active and growing, but the course is in great shape and the greens are very nice considering the time of the year. I’ll be back."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,it’s still technically winter here. Had a good time and would play again here but summer prices are a little crazy. The staff was very nice and helpful.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,The 27 hole regulation course has some wonderful undulating greens. The middle and road 9 have housing on several holes. The creek 9 has no housing and some rolling terrain.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,The Dye Course has abandoned the back 9 on its par 3 course.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Creek to MiddleStarter starts us start on creek, we tee off as a twosomeGo to our balls and starter comes out tells us to go backto tee, we need to start over????? We drive back then he tells usto join another twosome, who are in separate carts, what a way to start the round. What a cluster F—-kWon’t be back. Not worth the drive."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Loved the choice of tees. Love the lack of blind shots. It is all in front of you.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"27 holes available, reasonably priced, and terrific greens. Sign me up. It was a bit windy (like it normally is out here in the converted corn field), so scores suffered, but what a great track given the location. Not a bunch of up and down terrain, but most greens are elevated, there is a water hazard (penalty area now I guess) that comes into play on almost every hole. No duplication or similar holes at all. My favorite, although it isn’t the original 18, is the Creek 9. Normally in better shape, has the hardest par 3, par 4 and par 5 back-to-back-to-back on the whole 27 (IMO). Numbers 2, 3, and 4 will eat your lunch if the wind is blowing from the North! So much fun here, and the people are great."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,I will play here again. And again.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Great time, course was in great shape. Pace of play was a little slow, but not bad, about 4 1/2 hours. Tee boxes could be in better shape, green were fair to good. Fairways and rough were well maintained. Overall, great round for the money."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Ranger told us on 3 occasion to pickup the pace. When the group in front us wasn't clear for us to hit. The Rangers needs to identify were the problem is before ask a group to pickup pace. This was a extremely disappointing day of golf.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Paired up as a single force to ride with a strangeror pay additional $16 for separate cart. Round took 4:45 and didn’t see first ranger. Not going back.Greens need a lot of work .
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,It was raining when we got there. But the entire staff was very friendly. The course was beautiful. And it quit raining about the ninth hole. The sun came out and it was a great day
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Had some unseasonal warm weather on new years eve so we decided to enjoy a final round of golf in 2021. The course was very wet in areas but considering the weather in previous days it was actually in great shape. The greens were perfect and the tee boxes were good as well. Pace was fast and we had no issues at all. If you want a fun course with plenty of differing holes you should try the Legends!
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,The course was in great shape for December. I lost my driver cover and my phone and they had them the next day.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Shaggy gon sneeze. Get em wet shaggy. Bet you want to make a big ol sandwich.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"The course was in good to great condition, especially considering the recent lack of rain. The fairways and greens were in good condition. The tees were a little hard, but not bad. There was a foursome a couple of groups in front of use that was really slow. So we did some waiting on a lot of the holes. It was really hot, and it would have been nice if there was complimentary tap water with ice in insulated cups available. They did have complimentary water with ice in the club house. But the cups were small, and not insulated (paper). My ice lasted about two holes."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"We enjoyed the round; course is challenging and well-taken care of. Only complaints is that they put us with two other golfers with a very limited vocabulary (cursing every other word) even though the course was not that crowded. Secondly, on more than one hole, the sprinklers were on in the fairway as we were playing through--a worker was even present, but did not turn them off so we could play through them. Other than these things, it was a great round at a great price--would play it again!"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"The course is in great shape. Good to see a club, that gets a lot of play, be in terrific."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,The staff and marshalls were very unfriendly and treated us like we didn't belong. I will NOT be playing this course again.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,It’s nice playing a course in such good condition.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,My son and I book a tee time on Father's day and when we arrived we paid and got out to start and they told us we had to pair up with 2 people we didn't know. I ask for money back and I was told to bad. The owner is extremely rude. My son and I were stuck paying 110 bucks and didn't get to enjoy ourselves. If they would have said from the beginning we would be paired we would of went somewhere else but they didn't.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"The Legends of Indiana in Franklin, Indiana is always in nice condition. The fairways are reasonably wide, but some are harder to hit. The greens have plenty of undulations and are of average speed."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,First time playing and I’ll be back for sure. Beautiful course and challenging for an intermediate player.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"The legends golf club is a great value and gives off the feel of a true golfers facility with its driving range, putting greens, and 27 hole course. The whole area is nice and open so nothing feels cramped. The course itself is a nice layout and was in pretty good shape for fairly early in the season. I also enjoy coming to legends."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Pros; played middle to roadGreens as always smooth and fastFairways a little spotty but very nice4 hour round not badCons:Lady at desk and starter not on same pageShe said single joining us starter said another 2 someWorked out well Two nice guysBunkers need some work
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Very smooth day, even with a high volume of golfers. Staff was friendly and efficient. Will definitely return!"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"The course is in very bad condition, very muddy after rain. It was rainning during our play. Tried to ask for a rain check but was declined. Will not play there again."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Course was in great shape. Greens were fast and true. The starter acted like he had better things to do than be bothered by my question about the rotation I was playing.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Drove by this course several times but never made time to stop in. The staff was courteous and attentive. (With COVID 19, make sure to be there early to check in.)The course was well maintained, but that is because the grounds crew was trimming the greens as we were chipping up. The signage needs some attention. For a first timer, it was difficult to get to the starting tee and the follow-on back nine. For the expense, I would call ahead next time and figure out the grounds crew schedule before I booked."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,The greens are in great shape. The course in general is well maintained.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,This is the second time i have played here. The place is well organized and flows real smooth. I say it’s the chic filet of courses because the staff are so nice/ courteous they make you feel like you have been going here for years. Even the ranger is a awesome dude i love this place just wish i lived a little closer.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Most impressive were the greens. Some marks from players failing to repair divots, but it’s obvious the greens crew know how to manicure a green. Smooth, fast rolls, that break true. Impressive for Indiana in September."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Very Good course, great price on deal. Our 4-some enjoyed the course and the challenge. Hope play a few more times before winter."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Booked the wrong course and Golfnow website would not allow me to cancel.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Since we reserved our round for only 3 people, the possibility of a ""perfect stranger"" joining us is always there. I asked the young man in the club house if the course had a provision for providing and extra cart for such a situation. He said that a 4 person round merits 2 carts. A third cart would cost $16. I let him know that just down the road (Timbergate), they had modified their carts with a plexi-glass barrier that extend the length of the interior of the cart, effectively ""dividing"" the cart in half when it came to breathing space. Legends should do the same with some their carts!"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"It was “ Blistering Hot!” yesterday, so I really appreciated the course having ice water available in the course coolers and clubhouse!"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,First course I’ve seen doing this yet this year w all the COVID 19 restrictions
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Thanks for your service!
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"I've been going here for a while and the course is always in great shape. Course plays long especially for my game but no complaints. Fairly wide open with exception of some water and sand which i seem to find. Good staff, mostly friendly. My only complaint is paying $16 extra to ride solo thru the week when they weren't busy at all. Doesn't seem fair that people with underlining conditions have to pay extra to golf. Weekends I totally understand. But overall I like this course."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,I really enjoyed playing here. It was my first time to play. We played Creek & Road. The course offers plenty of challenges but isn't unfair. Greens were beautiful. It was in very good shape.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Had a great day of golf. Got a good rate on golf now. 12 dollars cheaper than at the course. Friendly staff. Golf conditions were good. Had been several years since playing at the legends. The course had grown a little and it probably was not in as good of condition as it had been when I played there about 5 years ago, but still nice and worth playing. My only gripe would be the poor sand quality that is in the bunkers. It is sand you see on a Indiana beach or quarry. Not the kind of sand that should be used for a golf course. Enjoyed my day of golf as the weather was great and shot a 76 from the black tees."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Excellent condition. Friendly service. Good food.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Great for under 30.00 course I near nowhere tho. Lol
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Course was in decent shape. Work needs done around the ponds
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Being there for the first time the layout was very confusing. The course was in very good shape.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"They know how to run a golf course. Packed on a Sunday afternoon, but wife and I played in 3-1/2 hrs even with cart path only. Course in great shape. All for $20. Pretty tough to beat."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"The course was in very good shape for the middle of summer. However, the course layout seemed boring and flat for the hype it gets in Indiana. There are other nearby courses that are more fun and cheaper. Also, the starter got mad at us for getting to the tee box 1 minute behind schedule even though no groups were behind us. We caught up to a few groups in front of us within 5 holes and the pace of play was very slow from there."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"The middle and road nines get all of the love at the legends, but the creek 9 is my favorite of the three. The opening hole is a solid dog leg par 5 that can be birdie or double depending on how you play it. The second hole is a formidable par three and arguable the toughest hole on the property with length and a pond that is highly in play. The rest of course offers a great challenge and offers a good variety to the course."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"I am a new member at the legends this year, and I have been very pleased with the course so far. The course has been n good shape for the fall. The greens are in good shape considering how much play the course gets. The middle/road course is more of a links style layout with a good variety of holes. The layout can be scored upon depending on the wind. The bunkers could use some work, but other than that it has been excellent fall golf. The customer service is excellent!"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Played Sept of 2019. Course was in very good shape. Good course to visit. Wouldn’t play it every week but look forward to playing it when I do.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,we had a fun day of golf at the Legends...the course was in good shape...a few blind shots but pretty good layout...there are a lot of good golf courses in indy...this would be in the middle of the pack
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Staff friendly. Course in very good shape. Layout is fun. Pace very nice. Would play frequently if I lived in Indy.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"It was a beautiful late summer day and I think everyone had the same idea as me. The course was packed from morning till dusk. They did a good job of keeping everyone moving. However, we were backed up on 2-4 holes. Not terrible but a little bit of a delay. The course was in outstanding condition. I started at the range, then the chipping green, and ended up playing all three courses before the day ended. If they can keep people moving, this course is definitely worth a visit."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"I live in the area and have played this course maybe 10 times. I love the course and conditions are always pretty good. The course needs to better maintain three things though. 1. Cut down tall shrubs around the ponds, on some holes when playing from the blue you have no view of the fairway. 2. Need to water the rough, hitting from rough was like hitting from concrete (this is a common problem in most courses this year due to heat). 3. Sand in the bunkers is very grainy can use new sand.I will still go and play again though, fairways and greens are perfect even after this scorching heat and staff is very friendly and accommodating."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,This course is always in good shape !Greens are always smooth and usually fastGood layout with all the trouble you need with errant shotsPlay this course about 25 time a yearNever get tired of it !BG
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Melted in the heat around the Middle/road course at Legends. The course has an interesting layout, with some contours that are links-style, but enough trees on it here and there to not really be a links course. Some water in play as well. Putts never broke as much as I expected. Overall most of the course was in good shape, with some minor spotting here and there in the fairways. Greens and tees were solid. Sand was a little inconsistent and rocky. They care about and enforce pace of play, which more courses should do. Definitely worth a stop if you're driving down 65. I'll be back to check out the other 9 and par 3 course."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"I was very impressed as a first timer at the Legends course. The staff was friendly and professional. The course had numerous challenges including bunkers, water hazards, and long grass, yet there were opportunities to score well on many of the holes. Overall, a great course and value. I would highly recommend to any golf enthusiasts."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"The course was in excellent condition. Greens and tee beds very nice. Rough was challenging, so great incentive to keep shots straight and on target. Bunkers in decent shape, although the sand includes little stones.I like that the course management provides written responsibilities for those using the course, both in maintenance and time management."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,The course was very wet which made for challenging play from the rough. Cart paths were flooded.All that said and the course was still playable!
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Creek for First nine. Needs a little TLC. Bunkers a little rough, and the grass needs some love. But it's early. Road nine in much better shape. Definitely had more care and attention. Good round. Good course. Not what it was, but still a good track."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"This course was in pretty good shape for early season. With all the rain we have had, I wasn't expecting the course to be in good shape but I was pleasantly surprised."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"The course conditions this morning weren't the best, mainly due to the heavy rains. Other than that, it looks like the course will be in great shape once again this year at the Legends. Can't beat it for then money either."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"The Legends was a very nice course. Very well-kept even after some rain. But, no ranger out to monitor pace of play. We got stuck behind a slow foursome and wasn’t able to get in front."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Nice option in the greater Indianapolis area. Played 36 holes with my group from Michigan without having to play the exact same 18. Fun course...we had a nice time here.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"It was my second time playing there, but won’t be the last. Course was in great shape, layout was fun to play, and staff was very nice and helpful."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"My daughter and I played 9 holes on a rainy day. The course was pretty much empty as the weather front scared people off for a couple of days. However, course was in great shape. I play golf about 3-5 times per month and this is one of the better condition courses I’ve okayed on this year. We will definitely be back, just hoping for better weather."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"First, booked middle and road nines. When arrived we were sent to road and creek nines. You should be able to book what you want to play."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Second, every trap was unplayable. The course was wet, but there wasn’t sand in the traps if conditions were drier. Sad to see an old reliable course begin the slide downhill"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"The Legends is a very nice track. It was my third time playing there this year. Everything was great...however the greens were a little dry. Pretty sure they were under some heat stress. Same goes for the fairway and rough areas. Overall though, it's still a great course (at a great price). Definitely worth the drive."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Legends is a mere shadow of the pristine splendor it was years ago.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"The Legends is one of my favorite courses in Central Indiana...it didn't disappoint this past Sunday. Great pace of play, beautiful course conditions, and a great layout...the only downside is that it was a little wet on the course from the previous evening. Other than that, it was great!"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Played here the last 3 Sundays, so I wanted to get a review in. Course is in pretty solid shape, tee boxes are good, fairways are firm and greens are firm and fast. Most bunkers are in good shape, though I found a few that hadn't been treated in a while. Rough is dry and can be patchy. I'm good with that - it's not where you should be hitting and if you do, it should be a challenge. Just don't expect the ball to hang up much, so if you're crooked it's gonna bounce."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"If you've haven't played here before, you should really enjoy the day. I like the layout, with a some fairly generous landing areas in the fairway and some elevated greens. I think the course pivots nicely from harder holes to easier ones, keeping pace well. Wind is always a factor out there, so club appropriately. Water isn't predominately a factor unless you're chunking the ball. From the right tees, you can bust a good tee shot to get a good look at birdie, and the Par 5s are gettable too. I really like the start on the Road side, with a par 5, then back to back tough par 4s."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Volume is up thanks to the membership deal (incl. me); I'll be watching to see if they can keep the pace (with volume/conditions and actual pace of play).
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Made tee time 2 days in advance and couldn’t even play the course I paid for because they were too busy so they pushed me over to another 9 holes which wasn’t as nice. Pretty disappointing!
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Greens rolled very well, but the rest of the course was rough."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Always happy to get a round in this late in November. The course was in great condition. Very few people on the course so we played at our own pace which is pretty quick (18 holes in 2.5 hours).
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"a little pricey for the end of October, that is only complaint."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Played creek and road nines. Creek was very slow pace. No groups allowing play through. Bunkers had grape sized rocks in them. Not impressed. Road nine was quick. Dont care for houses that close. Bunkers were better. Not bad for a hot deal but not worth the drive for me.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Course was in perfect condition and greens were in great shape. This course has always been in emmaculate condition. I recommend this course for experienced golfers.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Greens were in excellent condition, pace was good. Some bunkers need work as too muddy conditions others were great."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Great course, excellent value! Course was in perfect condition."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Course was in great shape, well kept. Amazing course for the discount price."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,I love this course- I'm almost always a single and they have never had a problem. Other golfers also understand and let me play thru all the time.(some places I play they won't let me play thru no matter how slow they are)
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Bunkers and upper tee boxes still need work.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Keep up the great work!
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,I purchased a 3:34pm tee time thru GolfNow for 9 holes at $20/person. When I got there I was told that it's $23/person. Shower them my confirmation/receipt and they still refused to honor the $20/9 holes. Ended up paying the extra money and played anyway. Sand traps haven't been raked all season and ended up moving ball out of traps due to poor conditions. Didn't want to break a club or my wrist.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Greens quick and fairways were rolling well. Only drawback were bunkers that had been replenished but not worked.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Every time I play this course. I always end up thinking....Why don't I play here more often?!Just a great course. Greens are flat. It never breaks as much as it looks.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Hadn't played the course in a couple of years. Surprised at how bad a condition it was in.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,I really enjoyed this course. I was a single and got paired with a threesome and we all had a great time. Very nice course the only downside to the course is the green wasn't mowed.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"The course was in decent condition for February weather, Greens were better than expected although bunkers are still out of play due to winter weather. Definitly looking forward to the spring! Should be ready then."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,The course and greens were in great shape except for the usual bit of Fall debris on the greens (pine needles / leaves etc.) The tee markers were not there for some reason but had my GPS and estimated approx. tee position. Overall very happy with the course!
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,The condition of the course (Middle & Road nines) was excellent. Fairways and greens were in peak shape. Certainly no signs or after effects from any aeration or top dressing. Greens held very well and putted exceptionally true.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,This is my 3rd time playing this Course and the Course was in the Best Condition of all them. The Fairways were cut nice and the Greens were Great as well.And at Golf now price it was well worth and and look forward to coming back. Would love to play Creek but thats not offerd on Golf Now.The staff was great as well as the Tenderloin Sandwich.Multiple sets of tees allow every golfer of every skill level to enjoy great time.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,The course was in great condition and the staff was very friendly
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Only played here a few times, mostly because of distance from my home, bit absolutely love this course! Very well maintained with the truest rolling greens! Scenic layout with varying challenges. Number of bunkers is a little intimidating, but fortunately we stayed out of them for most of the round! Wish this course was closer as I would play here more often! Highly recommend to anyone who wants to play a truly nice and challenging course!"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Pete Dye courses are infamous for their number of bunkers and for that reason they should be in excellent condition. The bunkers appear to have not had new sand added since the course originally opened. Most of them not raked and edges not pulled up on any of them with 98% of them having rutted edges from wash-out. Several had grass growing in them.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Otherwise, it's an above average course. Would play there again if the GN deal was right."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Very fast greens and course is in phenomenal condition! Very challenging for all levels! I didn't care for the bunkers because they had a lot of pebbles and hard compacted sand but fairways and greens are perfect! Beautiful golf course!
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,My son and I had a great time playing here the greens were fast and pure we played from the blues and was a good challenge for the both of us
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,I don't play this course very often but when I do it's always in superb shape and is well worth every penny that is spent on it. I played on May 23rd and the day couldn't have been any more perfect except for a lower score. If you haven't played here you are missing out on a true gem in the Indianapolis area.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Greens are fast and smooth. I play this course quite often. The course is always in good shape except the sand traps which does not matter to me. They are much better now.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Good course - played 18 in 4 hours - only issue was there were no ball washers on the course and had been alot of rain - no way to clean muddy ball.staff was friendly
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Love the course the only problem I have the bunkers need work
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Course was in great shape even thoughbthe climate has been very dry the last month.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"We grabbed a Hot Deal, and played Sunday October 11. Course was in outstanding condition. Greens are fast and true. Fairways are lush and green. Tee boxes were well kept. I've played here many times in the past. It is a similar course to Heartland Crossing, but the Legends must have more cash behind the operation because they are doing a much better job of keeping up their property."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Great course for Fall play. Fewer trees means less time trudging through the leaves.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,We had a very enjoyable time. The course was in excellent condition. I'll be back reasonably soon.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Course in great shape for all the rain we have had
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"This was the third tone I've been on this course, with all the train we've had the course was still in great shape, the creek on 15 was a large pond and I really liked it, they should make it permanent"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Understanding that it has been wet but that is no reason to stop all course up keeping. Great design, just seems the course is being let go."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Great course but it was a little bit saturated due to all the rain
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"The Legends is well known around town. Everything was great except one thing. The greens were rough. The ball would bounce most of the way to the hole on more than a few holes. Other than that, was a good time. Would have been even better if it wasn't for my terrible score!"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"This course offers a number of different options. There is the 27 hole course, as well as, a 18 hole par 3 course. Course was in good condition. The grounds crew was out doing some much needed work on the bunkers. Would recommend."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,had a great time...played well and the people I played with played well. Staff was very accommodating for a single player.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"I come here a lot and a girl who was just started working snack bar was taking care of me she was awesome she had went to the back to go grab some banana peppers for my sandwich and Cindy Bishop comes slamming the side door open saying, "" Sorry______ is new she doesn't know what she is doing yet."" I proceeded to say she is taking care of me just fine and her sister works here and She knows her way around. And Cindy then said, "" well I'm sorry for the slow pace"" The young lady taking care of me was excellent she is a server and knows her way with food and drinks. I have never been so embarrassed for a manager until that day. Cindy needs to learn to treat her employees a lot better and more people might come in and get food and drinks if she knew how to treat people."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"I moved here from FL so I'm a bit spoiled by great golf and service. This is a good track, nice layout. Minimal interaction with the staff but it was just okay, not great."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,I really like the layout of a few different holes on the course my only complaint is that the fairways and greens were in bad shape. I expected them to be in tip top shape for the 40 a person. I have played city courses that are in better shape then this one is at the moment. Staff was amazing. Also they had a demo out on the range that was supposed to last until 3pm but they packed up at 230 and left. Right as we were coming off of hole 18.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Nice course. Conditions were great. Forgiving course.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,this is a nice course!! the facilities are nice and the greens and tee boxes are really nice!! the only thing I thought would be nicer are the fairways but I still highly recommend it!!
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Played this morning, was a nice day & course was in great shape. We had a lot of rain yesterday, but this course drains pretty well. Tees, fairways and rough were all maintained nicely. Greens were in great shape and fast. Bunkers are being worked on (according to signage on clubhouse) and they were a little blown out by water. I only found 2 of them today and took advantage of the rake/re-drop rule in effect. This course is almost always in good shape, today no exception. I'd have expected them to ask for a little more competitive green fee (we pd. 45) for Oct mid-week, but we got a good course."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"The Legends is a nice course, home of the Indiana chapter of the PGA. Expect some challenges, not many trees but plenty of water and sand. 27 holes to choose from as well, so always an adventure!"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Played at 4pm and everything was great!There was a slow twosome in front of us, but it was a beautiful day and beautiful course :)"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"I played this course in early June and loved it. Soft tee boxes, well-kept fairways and fast, smooth greens. Unfortunately it seemed as if the maintenance staff had merely quit trying towards the end of the summer. It was still in ""good"" shape but not nearly as nice as earlier in the year. The most noticable difference were the greens. Speed and smoothness of the greens had significantly decreased. Still a good value at $20 to ride 18, but didn't leave wanting to come back soon."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Very challenging course for the average player.very nice practice facility .prices in the club house were very reasonable and the staff was very polite
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"course in great shape, Bunkers need attention, not much sand more like dirt."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Apparently golfers at these courses don't know how to fix ball marks. Maybe the softness of the greens contributed to multiple unrepaired divots on greens. The greens were fairly fast and true but unrepaired divots impacted several putts. The fairways were mowed at higher level than you normally experience on courses charging $55 a round. Sand traps were littered with rocks due to deteriorating condition of upper bunker walls. Glad I didn't pay full price to play this course.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Course was in great shape a lot of sand traps beware
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"very nice course that is in great shape,was a great deal"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,This is a great daily fee golf course. Three nines so pace of play is outstanding. Well designed with good greens. Always an enjoyable game.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,This was the first time I played this course. Course was in good condition and I would definitely play here again.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Course very well maintained and in excellent condition. Rough not to high. Greens in excellent shape. Staff was friendly. I played as a single with no problems. 2 4-somes let me play thru as well... which was nice for a change.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,since I am used to playing golf ind western Pennsylvania this course was a nice reprieve. my brother and I play there on Monday afternoon and there were hardly anyone on the course. the course was well maintained and had a nice variety of difficulty. sand traps were a little hard but that is nothing out of the ordinary. the greens were freshly top dressed and still a little quick I can't imagine how they are in normal play. my only complaint is that they recently put in 15 inch holes to accommodate soccer players to play foot golf. this would not have bothered me but I had an eagle attempt on a par 5 and the 15 inch hole was right and my way. well well worth the 20 on golfNow definitely get a round in there
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,Has it all for the beginners to the scratch golfer.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Course was heavily watered, no roll on fairways. Understandable for these weather conditions. Greens rolled true and were in good condition. Good experience."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,We booked Middle to Road but when we arrived we were put onto the Middle to Creek. Then while making the turn a two some was put in front of us slowing the back nine down by over 30 minutes. Not the best!
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Moreover, I can play without crowded because 27 holes."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,This course is not the longest you will play but these Par 4's that are less then 400 yards are very challenging! GIR's are very important because scrambling is tougher at this course then most! This is a direct affect of the course being a Pete Dye design. And throw in the wind and you have all the challenge you will need. This is a great course regardless how long off the tee the player is! I will be back again for sure...
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"I got a great deal at a great course, thanks golfnow!"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"The course was in great shape and challenging as always. Unfortunately the rate I booked was for a senior rate, so we had to pay more to play. Nevertheless, I would recommend this course for sure."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"Despite weather changes, Legends remains the best condition course I have played in Indiana during the month of October. Greens were firm but a well placed approach shot was easy to keep on. Only real complaint was that a few bunkers were rock hard and very difficult to control. Overall, highly recommended"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,recommend staff very friendly had good time would play again
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,It had been at least 10yrs since I had played here and I expected it to look as good as it did because it was The Legends!! It was raining half of our round and it was stillGREAT!!!
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,"greens always in great shape and very consistent,bunkers could use some sand and attention,for cost GPS would be nice on carts,great practice range"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Middle Course,537-the-legends-golf-club-creek-middle-course,I thought this was a very nice course/layout away from the city. It is a bit of a drive from Indianapolis but well worth the drive at least once. The course was in great condition from tee to green and the staff was super friendly in accommodating us. Get a group of buddies together and have a good time playing a very nice course. I give it a 4 stars and not a 5 because the fairways are bluegrass instead of bent grass (personal preference and not meant to be a knock on the course). If you like bluegrass you will likely love this place and give it a 5.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Only knock on the course is no bunkers. Other than that layout was very nice. Fairways and greens were in great shape. I grew up across the street from course and I haven’t seen it in the good of condition in 20 yrs. The group I was with golfs all around ( usually outside of 465) and belong to clubs. Even they same this should be a 50-$60 course. Would’ve given a 5 on pace but for the 1st 9 holes we had a group of 3 that spent 5min minimum (all 3) looking for balls. Which became frustrating, after that everything was great. Will be back very soon"
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"It was a great way for me to spend time with my husband, playing golf at South Grove! Steady pace of play for the most part. Course was pretty baked and fast. Great value!"
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Historic course from 1902 shows signs that the end may be near. Layout and greens are good but the old mature trees are overgrown and Course is rough around the edges. One of the very few bunkers left, on hole 7, is really mud but it does have a rake! Would like to see this course get the attention Pleasant Run gets, as it could again be a real asset for downtown, and it was busy."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,This was a nice course. It played quickly. No pressure or hounding from other groups or employees. I was in town for the weekend. The next time that I'm in Indy I will definitely return!
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Pretty straightforward back and forth course, trees are the main obstacle, a couple holes have very narrow landing areas. Most holes are straightaway, with only a couple doglegs. No sand traps that I remember, so greens are accessible. White tees made several of the par 4’s pretty long, gold tees would be better for me. Greens were generous size, green speed was on the slow side. Very walkable: greens and tees are close together, not much elevation change. Greens and fairways were in pretty good shape, rough had a lot of clover. Senior weekday rates very reasonable for the quality of the course, and for a walker it is a bargain. I walked 18 holes in 3:10 even though I had to wait on every shot, so the weekday pace of play was pretty good. Not the most beautiful or challenging course, but I enjoyed it."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Course was in good condition, especially the greens. We played 18 holes of enjoyable golf with very little wait time in 3 1/2 hours."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Pretty straight course in pretty good shape, not going to overly punish you. That being said the desk worker was very rude and inpatient and don’t feel like explaining where the carts were, and some of the grounds crew would go out of their way to make noise or cut in front of me on holes when they hadn’t even been within 3 holes of me previously, and this happened multiple times. Can’t say I’ll be back anytime soon"
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Hope they don’t close this course as rumors have been swirling. Fun layout, good conditions, old school greens with charm."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Be prepared for a 5+hr round. On a Sunday afternoon, they wouldn't respect tee times. Walk-ons are available to play without a tee time. (First Come First Serve System)"
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Great value course. Well kept. Beautiful course inside the city. Will be back again.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"For a city course with a very reasonable rate, I was pleased with the course. Not very challenging, pretty straight and narrow with tons of trees lining the fairways. There were a couple of rough patches throughout but it's the end of season so it's to be expected. Overall, I liked the course and would play again."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"In operation since 1902, hence the old growth trees are many. But landscaping and arbor needs are great."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Well kept course with a fun layout. Greens are slower than some courses but great for beginners and intermediate players.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Course very dry due to weatherGreens putt well but will not holdExcept in front where water drainsTees pretty beat upFairways not badRough is cut to high for amount of clover25$ golf course
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"I play pretty regularly all over the city but for some reason always get treated weird at this one course. This time the guy said I didn't pay for my round, even though I booked through GolfNow and told em so. After a few go rounds I finally pulled up the receipt. The guy finally threw the key down on desk in anger. Tired of giving this place my money"
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Absolutely had a ball. The course was in excellent shape, best greens of any course I played this year. Will definitely be adding this to my list"
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"For a municipal course, it was a good shape and much harder than that the 117 slope indicated for the back tees. 200+ par 3's. A couple of really long par 5's. Wife played the red tees which were pushed up appropriately. A great course for a husband and wife group."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Group of 5 in front of us would not let us paly through until I came on tee and asked if we could play through. Isolated incident, but was incredible that we had to wait every shot as a twosome on a fivesome and they would not let us play through."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Staff can never find the GolfNow reservations or how much we've paid.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Can’t fault the course just a very busy day . Course is really neat for a public course in the middle of the city
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"I finally got out to play the grove last weekend, and it was a nice layout. The greens were the best part of the course. They rolled consistently and true. The rest of the course was average at best. Shaggy tee boxes and the bunkers left a lot to be desired. 6200 yards from the tips and the course has several long holes 2 450+ par fours And a 230 yard par 3. Fun round!"
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"This course is, by far, the best value in Indianapolis - maybe Indiana. I highly recommend."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"I would go out of my way to play South Grove. Fantastic course for the recreational golfer. Frankly, this is the best value golf course in Indiana. Play here!"
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Great course! Played behind a slow group, but still enjoyed the round."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Staff are the best from Pro to the gentlemen cutting the ruff. Carts are clean and fast as are the greens.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Greens in great shape for this historic old course. Plenty of mature trees.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"You need to be very accurate off the tee in most cases, narrow fairways lined with trees will require a tr4icky second shot. Overall the course was in great shape, and it gets a lot of play. The tee boxes could use a little attention."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Enjoyed playing this course. Grounds well kept and clean.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,I love playing South Grove. The course was in very good condition. Helpful proshop staff. I will be back!
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Greens excellentFairways averageTee box’s need cut and placed on level ground
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Course was in great shape, staff were professional and safety minded for themselves and for us golfers."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"I love this course. For the money, it's the best course in central Indiana. For the infrequent golfer, this course is not too challenging, yet not too easy."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"I play this course monthly, the staff does a fantastic job."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Very walkable, though not too much extra to ride."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Check it out!
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,ProsGreens :could not be any smootherA little long but all the same speedFairways: grass a little high but fullOverall course in best shape it’s beenFor quite awhileConsOnly Con Twosome in cartIn front of us had course backed upNo Etiquette We waited every shotNo one in front of them for 3 holes
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Everyone was very professional and took precautions to keep us all safe. special shout out to the young man in the Purdue hat cleaning the carts, He was very friendly and professional when I returned my cart after the round. Wish him the best in his freshman year at Purdue."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,The course is Ok. Maintained Ok. My complaint is with how they determine par. It’s a par 70 course but on the back 9....from the WHITE tees... there is a 425 yard par 4 followed by a 440 yard par 4. Both of these holes should be shortened or made to be par 5’s. There are only one par 5 on the back 9 so why not not convert the holes?? Oh...and...there is a par 5 on the front 9 that is only 450 yards!! It makes no sense! The course would be MUCH more fun and fair as a par 72.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Grounds could be in much better condition and clubhouse is never overly friendly. Trees should be trimmed for blue tees and tee boxes are in poor shape. Overall, a fair course but you can’t take it too seriously in this condition."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,The fairways and greens are in immaculate shape it’s been a couple years since I played that course but I really enjoyed it I will play again there soon
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"We were never pressured for pace, and had a great time. It seemed like they had sprinkler issues and there were puddles and some mud pits of the edges of a few fairways. Only issue."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Fairways and Greens in good shape but Teeboxes and ballwashers are terrible. Ball washer water and towels look and smell like the haven’t been serviced in 5 yrs.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,If you bring your own ball washer you can have a great time on this beautiful old wooded course if you can hit the ball straight and avoid the huge trees lining every hole!
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Good day of golf. Fairways and greens in great shape. Rough on some holes were cut nice and short while others weren’t. Overall good day.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,My brother Mike and myself booked thru Golfnow (hot deal). We got there checked in and got off few minutes early. Overall course was in fantastic shape! Great course great staff and great valueWill definitely play here again and highly recommend to others.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,My brother and myself got hot deal to play today.We arrived early and got out a couple minutes before our tee time. Course was busy and we had to wait almost every hole due to a slow group ahead of us. Overall still had good time playing. Course needs attention in most every tee box and fairways little grown but great value. Will definitely play there again Hope pace better
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Over all nice course. If they cut a few of the tress limbs out of the fairways would make it a lot better. But for the $$$ it was a nice 18 holes.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"South Grove is not a course I can recommend. The course is tight, in some cases too tight where trees overhang and could be trimmed without losing their defense in order to be fair, like on 2 and 11. Very back and forth in the layout, with few memorable holes. Tee boxes are basically spots in the grass that are mowed slightly lower than the rough. Fairway hard to tell apart from the rough. Greens were small and not quite as slow as shag carpeting, but it was close. Clientele were not the most considerate to faster players."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"If you find yourself there, use a club off the tee you trust to be straight or you will likely be punching out. It's better than its neighbors across the river (Riverside and Coffin) but that's lipstick on a pig. There's better than this a short drive away at Shank and Pleasant Run if you're staying on this tier of course in the city of Indianapolis."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"2nd time playing and zero complaints. Tree lined fairways, good layout, and maintained as well as expected. 100% worth the cost."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"If you’re young, new to golf, and not 30 minutes early, expect to get your butt chewed for giving them business. Guy told our group we were late when his clock was fast. Did not apologize nor did he need to. I could tell his life is a miserable one. In 50’s... still working on a weekend... while a young group is out trying to have fun.. must be jealous.... So after all the grief he gives us for being late we go out there and there’s 3 groups on tee box one. People probably confused because of the clock situation. It’s 2019 use the time on your phone! I would rather go to coffin or riverside where I won’t get treated and belittled ."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"First time out, and had great time. The course is fairly straight and level, and not too difficult, but in great shape, especially so early in the season. The grounds crew is to be commended for their work. The greens, again especially this early in the season, were very nice and true. Short course, and lots of fun. May become more difficult as the leaves begin to appear on the many trees, but just keep it in the short grass an you'll score well."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Greens were in excellent shape!
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Beautiful Green Walking Course w lots of huge shade trees to shelter you from the heat.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Can get in tree trouble if you have trouble hitting it straight!
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Wonderful choice if you enjoy walking!
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Just gotta get out before the league play starts. Solid course, straightforward, and the greens allow you to really score"
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Great challenging course to test your course mgmt skills. One small hiccup is the course doesn’t open early enough at 6:30 am whereas Golfnow has that timings listed in their app, had this encounter 3 times this season."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Nice layout with beautiful maturetrees. Condition of the teeinggrounds was horrible, but fairways andgreens were adequate."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Played this challenging course for the first time. Nice old course with lots of big trees that come into play. Must hit straight or strokes suffer. Greens had some slope and we're challenging too. I really like and appreciate that this city course caters to families with junior golfers. They play free round with playing adult anytime. Great way to get youth into the sport, wish more city courses did that. Great time with the family. Thanks South Grove."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Good location for meeting friends from different parts of the state
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Staff was very friendly, our cart went down on 15 they promptly got us a fresh one. Fall leaves were manageable & off the greens. Not a fan of the bag drop.Fairways & T-boxes were cut & rough was not too long either, leaves were manageable in the rough as well"
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Grew up playing ""the Grove"" and it is always a challenge. This was the first time playing it this year and it didn't disappoint. The trees have gotten bigger and playing the course is like putting on your favorite jacket! I recommend it to anyone and I also recommend playing in the Spring 4 ball tournament!"
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,The course was in great shape I had no problem with anything except these people wouldn’t let you play through or thy were complete Not Golf people
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"There are only 3-4 courses near downtown Indy and S. Grove is the best. The course layout is very straight forward, lot of up and downs. However, each hole is lined with trees on each side which is what makes it so difficult. If you finish 18 and say you did not hit a single tree then you are lying. I play this course 20+ each summer and it continues to grow on me. Best I've ever shot here was a 94 and I'm a 28 handicap. Would recommend booking a tee time via GolfNow!"
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,In town for a convention and looking for an inexpensive place to play. Course was well maintained and friedly staff directed me to an even better course the next day.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Bought Hot Deal for $20, coarse was in excellent shape overall , T-boxes were ok, greens were excellent. Staff was friendly, the club drop/pickup area is small and can get congested. I'll play Southgrove again."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"This course was great. I had several options and chose South Gtrove. Having nevrr been to Indianapolis before , I picked it because it was close to where we were visiting. It was great. The man at the counter that morning was very nice. The young man that i was paired with was a good golfer and we hsd great conversation. I would recommend this course to anyone and would love to play there again. Thanks Indianapolis parks for a terrifuc time."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Bryan S.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"We encountered some problems with the four-some behind us. On the 17th hole, we're still trying to find my ball, and haven't made our second shot, but the group behind us were already teeing off. My wife was in the center of the fairway (150 yards from the white tee box), waving and yelling at them to stop but they seemed not to care as they still hit their ball and went over our cart. We went back to tell them that they didn't observe the distance rule, etc. And then on the 18th hole, there was a back-up - we were 3rd to tee-off, as there's still a two-some before us waiting. But then these four-some came and waited where we were and were talking loudly while someone was teeing off. After our game, my wife reported this incident/experience to the course, but the staff in charge at that time just dismissed her concerns and simply said ""it happens all the time""."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,I am new to golf and this course was perfect for me to go out and play on a weekday. Minimal water traps and clear straight shots. Great cost! Friendly staff! Recommended for beginner play. I will be back!
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,It's better than cheap and you get more than what you paid for. Course was in great condition. It's not too challenging but is fun to play. Probably a great place to work on your intermediate and short game.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Nice city course. Fairways in good shape. Greens very nice. The growth of the course's trees over the last 30 years has kept this course a good challenge.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Love courses with character and this course had it.Short but tree lined made it challenging.Fairways could be mowed a little shorter.Overall great course.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,This may be the worst course in Indianapolis.Staff: not accommodating.Course layout: ok. Does force some tight shot placement.Tee boxes: upkeep is lacking. Looks like they planted crab grass and it's difficult to find a level spot.Fairway/rough: fairways are maintained. Rough is the same as tee box but longer crabgrass.Greens were very soft.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"South Grove is close to downtown Indy, making it a great urban golf option."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Course was very busy, had a 3-some and a 2-some ahead which turned into a 5-some after getting out of site of clubhouse, very slow play, no ranger. otherwise very nice Father's day with son, daughter, and grandson."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"I have played this course for over thirty (30) years. Brad, Allen and the staff are always friendly and helpful. The new guy, Joseph, is a find addition. Also, the Cart Jockey, Dmitry, is a great kid. He could use more tips as he is saving for college, so help the kid out.The course is in great shape every time I play."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Great course for the money. Great condition!
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"It was a great day there was a foursome one group in front of me and they had the course backed up, I was able to join group I. Front of me ( I was playing by myself, my grandson just rode in cart ) it wasn't too bad"
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Fast play, smooth greens, cold water in coolers, & friendly staff made for a fun day of golfing."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Fairways are tight but forgiving. Greens in really good shape. I love old established courses
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,We played 18 at noon on Saturday. We finished 18 in about 3hrs 35 mins. There were no groups immediately in front or behind us.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,The course has a few holes that were a little tight. It was humid when we played and the greens were slow.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"It has a nice older feel to the course. If it were maintained a little better, it would be real nice."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,It was a a great value for the price and I will definitely go back.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"South Grove has plenty of trees, so it's pretty common to hear golf balls bouncing off of them. Otherwise, the course has fairly wide fairways, few bunkers and only one water hazard. The course is always well maintained. Just watch out for those trees."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,This was the second time playin here. The first time was back in the fall 43* and rain. It was the first round I played in close to 10 yrs. let's just say this round was much better lol. The course looks and plays great. I'll make it a point to play here more often.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"This course rewards you for straight drives. You don't have to be long to score well here. Only disappointment was the greens, they were in good shape but couldn't get a ball to stick!! At the same time, as a public course with tons of play, you have to take certain measures to ensure the greens ability to last the season. Play the greens a club short or bump and run, its a lot easier than chipping down hill from the backside."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Course was a great deal. I walked 18 on a wonderful day. Never had anyone behind me. Caught a foursome on the back nine that slowed me a little. Ended up finishing the final two holes with them. Had powerade and payday...for about $4. It is a shorter course, no par 5s over 500 yds, I think. Only one hole with water, a par 3. There is an exterior chain link fence that occasionally comes into play if you stray from the fairways. The other side of that fence is not the greatest area of Indy. Jusf down 16th street is Long's Donuts...by far the best donut in Indy. Had to stop in there after playing."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Have played this course often over the years and have found it always in good shape, but this time for some reason it was like playing in a cow pasture....fairways and rough crazy long....did not enjoy!"
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"This course is about as centrally located as we have in Indy and even though it is in the city, it is a pretty quiet course. It is flat and the only resistance offered are the big old trees that line the fairways. Traps and water are rare here so you can play pretty quickly. On the day I was here the course had not been mowed (for a couple days?) and was kind of shaggy. The rough was so tall that balls were difficult to find even at the edge of the fairway......still a great little course for a relaxed game."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,This course is a good value and a convenient location
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"This course is an excellent value for the money, and perfect for all levels of experience."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Great course for the money! Greens roll smooth and true.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Rough and greens were un-mowed and abnormally high (even for a Monday)- both are usually in much better shape, especially the greens."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"South Grove provides good opportunities to shoot a good score, if you can keep it in the fairway. There are a few doglegs that will bite you if you get too greedy. It's a great course overall."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"The yardage isn't long, but the tree-lined fairways require straight drives. The greens were in excellent shape as was the practice green. Even without the Golfnow.com deal, this course is a bargain."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,Great place to play. Course not too challenging. GolfNow helped to make the quick decision to play that day.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Do not golf in the fall, all the leaves have been off the trees for at least a week, all they was blow the leaves off the fairway at best, especially the front nine. So if you hit into the rough forget about it, I lost at least a dozen balls in the leaves, or I could have spent hours looking for my balls. Unreal!! The golf carts have no windows on them."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Two friends and I rode 18 on a Sunday. Great weather that day, the course was steady but not too busy. Really good city course, and the greens were in surprisingly good shape for an inner city course. Oldest city course in Indy. Fairways are pretty open, and there few hazards other than the trees. Fairways could have been a little bit shorter. Course in pretty flat overall. Good value!"
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"For fall conditions the overall course was in great shape. The fairways and rough were a little longer than summer, but I am sure that has to do with the time of year. Definitely will play again this fall."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,The course has enough challenging holes along with some good birdie opportunities to make for an enjoyable round. Also this course has some of the best maintained greens you will see.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Course was in good shape, enjoyed playing course ,will play again"
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,I liked the course. It is well maintained and was not busy. No water hazards and open fairways are good. The cart was fast and easy to run.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"I went with a friend from work on a Saturday at noon for $21 and had a great time. I was very surprised that it wasn't busier since it was a beautiful day but thoroughly enjoyed my outing. We were able to play 18 in just over 3 hours, AWESOME. I had trouble booking the tee time on line, site kept going in a hazard lol but called golf now and super friendly staff member booked it with no problem. Two thumbs up for golf now, you guys are GREAT!"
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"Fun experience. How often do you get a chance to play a course that's over a 100 years old? Greens were quick and pristine. Most of the greens are on the smaller side, but typical of an older city course. Trees make a few of the fairways challenging to hit, but overall very forgiving. Staff very accommodating., Play was very light on a Monday mid-afternoon."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,It was a fairly easy course. It was nicely maintained. Lots of trees up'd the difficulty a little bit and very little water. It was close to the city but felt like out in the country. I got a great deal with the BOGO at $25 for 2 people. I would recommend it even at $25 pp.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"The toughness of this course comes from the tight tree-lined fairways and 3"" rough. Your ball disappears in the rough and makes it challenging to advance. Great course, good value. The menu choices could be better at the Pro Shop."
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,course is great . can't beat the value greens were perfect
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,"One of the best municipal courses to play in Indianapolis. This course has some tight tre- lined fairways, and the holes that are more open require some length off of the tee. Great place to learn to play and yet enough of a challenge for someone approaching scratch golf. In the summer, the Blue grass rough will challenge the toughest of PGA Champions!"
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,South Grove is a very nice city course. The course is very mature with massive trees and some narrow fairways as a result. The course played fast and the greens were firm and very nice to putt on. The overall length of the course is short even from the back tees which makes it enjoyable to all hitters. The par 5’s are usually reachable in two after a nice drive. Overall the course is average but I do recommend to those up for a challenge especially if you don’t always it straight.
South Grove Golf Course,552-south-grove-golf-course,This was the second time we played here in last 5 weeks. The course was in extremely good shape. The staff was very friendly and helpful. My family will play there more before season is over.
Douglass Golf Course,548-douglass-golf-course,"even playing in a steady rain course was fun to play, wide open so good for beginners to play, staff super friendly and courteous. greens drain well and also have some challenges to them with slopes. Will definitely go back on a nicer day to play"
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"Love the layout and the overall look. Needs some love, though."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"The 9th green has been ruined by gophers. There were a ton of leaves on the course, which is annoying when your looking for your ball. The creek beds are dry, but there is standing water where there shouldn't be. Not sure I'll go back, especially at $47 a round."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"Most of the greens were nice but several were in dyer need of maintenance. Loved the layout of the course with all the trees. Some narrow fairways kept you honest. I haven’t played the course in awhile, and others than the green repairs, everything was nice."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,Definitely a city ran golf course. The best thing about the course is the layout. The T boxes are poor at best. Fairways are very rough. Greens are good but the hazards(sand traps) were terrible.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"The course is not well taken care off. Rough was so tall, balls were difficult to find. Tee boxes had multiple types of grass. Sand traps didn't appear to have been manicured for weeks (weeds). The maintenance of this course is minimal at best."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,The greens were good - soft and held iron shots well. The speed of the greens was ideal.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,Golf carts are average condition with parking brakes difficult to set. Cart paths very rough. Parking lot full of weeds.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"Overall, I am not sure how this golf course remains a viable business. I will not play it again nor recommend it."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,This was a blast. Really loved this course. It was sad to play the hole by the old Iron Skillet. I would definitely recommend this place. Course was in good shape.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,It was our first time playing on this course. We did enjoy it except for the soggy areas from a downpour the night before. Good place to practice for different skill levels and very convenient to the city area. I’ll definitely come back.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"Overall this was a cool and challenging course. Could use a little upkeep, especially with the golf carts and pavement on the steep cart paths. Very good value though; would definitely go again."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"For a municipal course. This is the best in the area. Look, it’s not private course in Carmel but if you’re looking for a good deal on a city course. This is a great one."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,You may want to call ahead to make sure back 9 is open. Booked 18 not knowing back 9 was closed. Course was over crowded with people circling back around to play a second round of 9.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,It was great to be able to get out and play in early February staff was friendly.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"I want to love coffin - the layout is more the just shoot straight and don’t miss. But the course conditions are just abysmal. It feels like you’re hitting off concrete with ever shot. Even in the fairways. The tee boxes are not mowed at all. Good luck finding a place to put your tee or an even spot to stand in. The greens are fun and offer a good challenge, but they are spotty too. I will not be playing here again. Many other courses that are in far better shape near by."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"If you haven’t played coffin in the last 3 years, you’re missing out. The course is a test to skill and beautiful at the same time. One that you can score a 90 on and be pumped about. I will be back."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,I had played here in an outing 2 days prior and brought my husband back. We had a great day!
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,Enjoyed this course layout was great pace of playGreens great shapeOnly complaint are the cart paths are in terrible shapeGood value for the $
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,I was given no notice my tee time I booked and paid ahead for was not allowed by the course. The course blamed GolfNow for allowing the booking. I drove 30 minutes across town for what was a “business” round and was left looking like a fool.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,The young man did show empathy and I congratulate the course on his professionalism.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,GolfNow doesn’t offer an easy pathway to be reimbursed from what I can tell.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,I’ll consider not using GolfNow in the future and stick with courses that offer their own booking platform.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,First time playing here and it is a fun well laid out course for us newbies. Greens felt slow and some tee boxes could use some love but overall well kept. Pace of play was great and we never felt rushed by anyone behind us nor were we held up by those in front of us. Wasn’t busy at all for a Saturday morning. We will definitely play here again
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"Not a regular, but more of an occasional long time Coffin golfer. While many of the tee boxes are atrocious, the bunkers are less-than acceptable, the 2 former bunkers on 12 which are now treated as 'ponds' are plain stupid and the cart path is reminiscent of the pot-hole infested streets of Marion County, the rest of the course (the fairways, the roughs, the slow greens) is surprisingly in good shape. If you hit from the yellow-stripe tees its a challenging course (and that is why I hit from the old-guy tee where I might be able to crack 80). But what a wonderful track. Is there a more spectacular spot to launch a drive than the 5th tee (do not hit right or near right anywhere on this hole)? And don't forget the very, very reasonable rate (for seniors) of only $25, 18 hole, riding. Woof!"
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"Great inexpensive place to play 18 holes of golf and a course that is a bit challenging for a public course. Was in better shape this spring, but the overall conditions have been improving in the recent years."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"First time playing Coffin. I first noticed how easy it was to lose my golf balls (I'm a new golfer) with the tight trees and fairways. It opens up as you progress through the course, however."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"$44 to play with a cart, personally, seems too high of an ask. Fairways and greens had a surprising amount of leaves on them that made locating your shot a bit more time consuming. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I wouldn't tell anyone to not play here - at least once, sure. But why wouldn't you play Eagle Creek for this kind of a$king price?"
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"I read a lot of the older reviews and they almost had me not take a chance on this round, but I booked a Hot Deal and gave it a whirl. I'm glad I did, because it was actually in pretty good shape. Cashier in the pro shop sent me off as soon as I arrived (45 minutes early) to join a two-some, and it turned out that we were pretty similar playing abilities and age. Had a nice round (82 from the whites) for a course I'd never even heard of until the night before."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"We played coffin on a weekend in July. I think we paid $42 with a cart. We overpaid by $42. I liked the layout, but it was in horrible shape. Standing water everywhere, crab grass, poor greens. Overpriced and underworked. Exactly what I'd expect from government run course."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"On my late season round course conditions were fine for a muni. I enjoyed the terrific layout, wild greens and bunkering that remain. The use of the hilly portions of the property well."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"As with all of the previous Tim Liddy courses, I thoroughly enjoyed this one too!"
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"Coffin belongs in a coffin. This course is a dump from start to finish. If you like crab grass, this is your kind of place as it's everywhere, including all tee boxes, ""fairways"" and rough - of which it was almost impossible to tell between the fairway/rough since neither were mowed and it was all crab grass. If there wasn't crab grass, it was because there was no grass from extensive water damage. The greens are beat to heck too.with almost all of them having large bare patches that were impossible to putt through."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"The layout has potential if they took care of it, such as the holes along the river (5-7), and 13-15 which were nice with elevation change. But the course is in such awful shape that I would not recommend getting close to it, let alone playing it if you value your time and money. I paid $35 to ride 18, and it was $34,99 too much for this place. I can't even recommend it to learn upon for beginners in this shape. Run far away from this place."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"I grew up close to this course and became familiar with it's rolling terrain and majestic trees at an early age and with it's overall beauty rarely found in a city course. In the 90'a the course took on some major changes,but the beauty remained and the challenges of the course were increased making one of my favorite places play and to bring friends.Being a municipal course unfortunately it does not get all of the attention it truly deserves,but it is still worth taking the time to enjoy this age old beauty not more than 2 to 3 miles from downtown Indy.."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,Used to be an enjoyable layout. Have let course deteriorate to crabgrass all over fairways and tees. Why does Indy Parks department allow the lessor of course have such deplorable conditions.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,Enjoyed except for the rain. I will certainly come back.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"This is a tough time of year to provide a review - October - as it was a little windy and there were leaves all over the place making it hard to find the ball and putt. I expected the course to be in better shape, but there were many bare spots and the tee boxes were quite rough. Greens were generally good, although they were recently cut. I got a deal on GolfNow, that is what drew me there, but I would want to see improvements in the course to be drawn back."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"I was looking forward to playing Coffin as I had already played Riverside and South Grove. Like the layout, greens were great as was staff. The fairways, well there were none. Had to search for a patch of grass to hit from in the middle of every fairway bar number one. Way over priced for the conditions"
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,Played in the rain which may have affected pace of play. Fairways had many bare spots and we had to use several forward tees because others were being seeded. Most greens were in great shape.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"First round at Coffin in a couple of years, course is atypical of the area - unique layout along a river with some elevation changes. A few big changes - a Foot Golf course has been incorporated int the front 9; a redesign of the big downhill par 5 15th hole; and a number of big trees down from the storms this summer. All-in-all Coffin delivers as a better than usual muni(just play the painfully plain South Grove across the river for comparison). Except for where there's been standing water in the low areas, fairways are in good shape, greens are true and as with so many area tracks, bunkers could use some love. Coffin has a few less-than- distinctive holes, but the good ones really stand out."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,Coffin should not be open. Their were trees down all over the course due to recent storms. The 1st fairway was totally mud. The grass hadnt been cut for weeks on some holes and it was like a recently cut hay field. The rough was so high in spots that the ball was unplayable. There was not one bunker with sand and playable. We wanted to leave after the front nine...
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,Course is struggling to recover from flooding. Some fairways in tough shape. Greens in good shape. Course needs a couple of weeks of dry weather and maintenance. It is a beautiful place.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,this course has very nice greens. well maintained. the rest of the course is average at best. poor fairways confusing layout and narrow playing areas on some holes. at the time of play the course had suffered from some flooding that made play challenging.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"Greens in good condition. Tees need leveling. Sand traps are more clay than sand; need some maintence. Ponds need aeration; lots of algae. Weeds, especially thistle, need to be sprayed. Staff very courteous & friendly."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"First time playing here. Staff was friendly, layout was pretty challenging (good amount of water, mounds, and/or bunkers guarding greens). Liked a few of the holes along the White River. Wish the fairways were a little better kept. Borderline goat ranch on some holes. Think it might help if they went ""cart path only"" on most, if not all holes, to maintain course conditions. I'll be back, but I'm not racing to go back."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"Fun little course for the value. I ended up paying about $20 on a ""Hot Deal"" through my Golf Now app on a weekend, but I don't think I would pay much more than that to play this course. Some interesting holes and overall in pretty good shape, but minimal amount of yardage markers was extremely frustrating."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"Friendly staff and good looking fast food (didn't eat) was countered by some of the worst course conditions that I've seen. Plenty of weeds and thick grass clippings made it imperative that you were accurate. The practice green is useless, have anthills on it, and does not represent the greens on the course. The course layout was a treat, with elevated tees and greens, several doglegs and relatively easy par 3s."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,Three balls disapperaed with my tee shot. the forth remained on the rough before fair way. To get a par on 18th hole became my golf aim.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"The course is centrally located and well maintained. Variation in elevation was a real plus, mature course with scenic river views."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,I highly recommend this course.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"Nice mix of hazards and open fairways to challenge all levels. Very picturesque, lots of mature trees."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"It was a little iffy with it being the beginning of fall, and all the leaves fallen. I definitely would recommend this course to anyone, and it's pretty tough but at the same time very playable! Great Golf Now candidate!"
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,Was in decent shape. Lots of leaves. Wish it was in another person's hands to bring it back to its glory. Greens were good.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,Played years ago and was pleasantly surprised of the quality of the course in early fall. Layout offers variety of scenic views especially in the fall with the colors changing.. It is on my must play annually when visiting my daughter..
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"The course, which has a terrific and challenging layout, had been in bad shape for years and i just started playing it again. It is in pretty good shape with the exception of the bunkers, which our two foursomes played as unplayable lies. The greens are the best I've ever seen them in over 30 years of playing the course."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"The staff, as usual, we're not friendly a bit, and borderline rude. This won't stop us from coming back for a good value for the money. I hope they keep progressing the course conditions."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"I am a beginner at golf so I don't have many reference points. Of the few courses I've played, Coffin is one of the most challenging and thus thoroughly enjoyable. I will definitely be back."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"I loved the elevated T boxes, narrow & challenging holes a MUST PLAY city coarse for us Hoosiers!! Super friendly staff supports a brick yard feel to the coarse. white river views were a huge unexpected bonus."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,Course was in okay shape. It's been a rainy summer in Indy so everything was soggy. Greens were good..fairways less than average and downright poor on some holes. Paid $21 for the round tho so hard to complain too much
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,This course could be an excellent one. But needs some work greens patche fairways need to be cut. Other than that no problems.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,Very good and has lots of chalanges. This is an very good one too play and I will play again.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,It's been awhile since I played this course and I was SURPISED and not happy with the majority of the surfaces. Especially with the amount of rain and cool days we've experienced this year.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,Lots or weeds and mud holes.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,Riverside is in better condition than Coffin. The positive....much cheaper to book tee time through Golf Now. Still not worth the money.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"Compared to the course across the street, this one has a pretty good layout. The holes are spread out well, and provide some challenges on every hole. Nice place."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"on a wet day course was pretty playable. low areas have thinner grass, but have to expect that right beside a river! Holes 9, 17 and 18 seem shoehorned in but still an enjoyable day. Greens excellent shape."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,I had a great experience on the course and it was very tough at times which made it more fun in the end if you enjoy a good challenge. I would definitely try to find a good deal on golf now.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. We will go back! Need senior tees and more yard markers. It was a fun day with my son and granddaughter.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"The bunkers were packed solid like concrete and some of the greens were a little torn up. Other than that it's a great course, one of my favorites in town."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"Greens are large and very fun to play with lots of undulation. Couple fairways were not great because of recent rain. Rough was reall tough. Bunkers need lots of work, more dirt than sand, lots of rocks"
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,I love this course due to the elevated tee boxes and for the price it cant be beat
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,if u like the white river then u will like this course
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,This course always floods. This means the grass seed that is put down never takes and the weed preventative that is used washes away. Because of this your lie in the fairway may not be any better than you lie in the rough. You would like to think that you'll be rewarded for good shots but at Coffin this is not always the case. Setting aside the issue of the course conditions the course has an interesting layout and at times is challenging. Several holes where it is better to keep the driver in the bag and select a long iron that may be more accurate off of the tee. The course is convenient and so if there's a good price and you're pressed for time it's worth looking at but for a good weekend round look elsewhere with better conditions.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,1st time playing and had a blast. For me the course was very challenging. Will be going back. The pro was awesome also. Great guy
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"They course isn't maintained good. You can barely tell the difference from the fairway and rough. The traps were in terrible shape. i like the track, but the course needs to be maintained better"
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,Only played 9 good pace some spots could have been better taken care of but overall good round. Played the front and if you keep your ball in the fairway like any course you'll be alright.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"This course has a nice layout, but the condition of the fairways, and the rough was terrible. Lots and lots of dead grass all over the place."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"This course is a lot of fun, especially the par 5 5th. The back 9 as a whole was more enjoyable than the front, but not in as good of shape. The course is right on the river, and at this time of year, the river is high and spilled onto the course in several places. The 11th is in very bad shape, and the 15th has a new creek that is unmarked. I'll definitely be back to the course, and expect it to have dried up and earn a 5-star rating!"
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,I have played here lots of time. There needs to be a marshall to monitor pace of play. We were a twosome and had to wait on this group of 4 all 18 holes. Never once did they offer to let us play thru.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,Great shape for this time of year and a challenging place to play. Staff was very kind. No ball washers yet but couse will fill in beautiful for the Spring!!
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,After a LONG winter it was nice to get out for the 1st round play in early March. The staff was (and is) very friendly and with $1.00 dogs and fountain drinks it was a good day!
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,Excellent Greens. A beautiful layout. Fairways and traps need more maintaining. It was very challenging and enjoyable.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,Coffin was in good shape considering all the rain recently and also due to all the leaves that have fallen so far this year. The course is diverse and the greens are challenging. It was an enjoyable day even though it was cold as the sun was out all day. The last two holes are the hardest as they seem to have the fairway against a river levee with a lot of trees on the other side. It is well worth it to play this course.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"The fairways have recovered from a very dry several weeks and the greens are very nice excepting a few small patches on several greens---nothing unusual for this time of year. Unlike many courses, drinking water and ball washers are still deployed."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"I am a weekend warrior and generally play consistant, when I play. The course was in good shape and had a great layout with several challenging holes. I particularly enjoyed playing the back side where the difficulty seemed to increase and demand more accuracy. Greens were in pretty good shape for being later in the season."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,who is drivingg maint vehicles acroos greens and leaving them rough too much repair on greens even for fall
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"Coffin fairways, 13 of 18, are either lined with trees, out of bounds or water hazards thus making the drive the most important shot on just about every hole. If you are a free swinger who grips it and rips it better take a few extra sleeves of golf balls."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,The course has made a great recovery from the late summer dry spell and holes 15 & 16 fairways are almost healed from the ditch construction related to the Marion College construction. The greens put true and are typically cut at moderate speed. The biggest maintenance issue are the sand traps in the lower holes that get washed out when the course floods.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"One of the worst courses I have ever played! Fairway is no different than the rough, bunkers is just a dirt hole, greens are not much better, crab grass throughout!"
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,Course in horrible shape. Sprinklers spraying us at tee box and when we let clubhouse know they say that they have trouble keeping that area in shape (?). Will never go back.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,fairways were a little dry with the weather in Indy.Greens were very nice. People had a lot of trash and tees on the course that needed to be picked up. Why don't people just pick up after themselves?
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,Very good pace of play. Course was in good condition for a municipal course.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"For the price, Coffin Club is the worst course in the Indianapolis area that I've played. Similar to Morningstar in maintenance and layout but the greens are not nearly as nice. Spend your money elsewhere."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"The greens were in great shape but the rest of the course is still recovering from the flood a few years ago. This course would be outstanding if it had bent grass fairways. A challenging layout with some holes that force you to hit some real golf shots and some other ""gimme"" holes to keep your scorecard in check. I will play here again."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,This course was very tight. It is right up against the White River. I thought it was a fairly good layout and set up for the area. The greens roll fast and true. The fairways were in decent shape. I would play this course if you want a good little challenge.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,I like the opportunites to challenge the level of play. Some of the fairways require accuracy from teebox. Plenty of mature trees to make the day interesting.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,I will play another round at this course prior to year end.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,Making good decisions on what shot to play is an important element while playing this course. This a mature and somewhat tight course to play. I enjoy the challenges of this course and have always made it part of my courses to play every season.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,I haven't played here in quite some time and I will definately add it to the rotation. The holes are all very different and offer their own challenges. My only complaint would be the length of the grass on the fairways and tee boxes. They seemed a little to long for a fairway and tee box.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,We hadn't played here for 2 years. The course was in really good conditions. Disappointed in pace of play due to slow group ahead and a couple bad rain delays. We only played 16 holes. I feel it wasn't course fault. We will book tee-times there again this summer.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"Greens in pretty good shape, course is challenging and a few elevated teeboxes which every golfer loves. Unique layout that is fun to tryout. It's not amazing but it is a nice course and one of the better values in town."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"Coffin is an under-appreciated gem of a course. It has some rough edges (pun intended), but its condition has steadily improved over the last few years thanks to the efforts of the present management. It has water, bunkers, dramatic changes in elevation, spectacular old-growth trees, and well-guarded and undulating greens. Although it does still need some work to be as good as it could be, it is easily among the best overall courses in the area...honestly, a treasure the City can be proud of. It WILL test of your game. Actually, it can kick your butt, and the price is quite reasonable. Highly recommended."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,This is a fairly pricey coarse for the shape it is in. About 2/3 of the greens have giant patches all over them. They are all loaded with ball marks as well. The grass was not well cut and weeds were everywhere in the rough and fairways. For what the charge you think they could afford some broadleaf weed spray or maybe gas for a lawn mower. Its sad too because it has a great location and it used to be in good shape but not anymore. Don't go unless its real cheap.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"traps need maintained, standing water...hole 10 might be one of the hardest in the state"
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,The only issue we had is the foursome ahead of us that was very slow. That slowed our play time down as well as those behind us. Most courses need to get rangers out there and get these folks to speed up or go play tennis.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"Course was played on a Sunday evening. Not many other golfers on the course after 5:30pm. Course is in really good shape; no bald areas and the fairways seem to be free of any water damage. This was evidenced by what appears to be a modified or updated drainage system. The insects were definitely and issue -so bring loads of bug spray/cream etc., -because water and OB areas are a plenty. Rough in most areas was thick and extremely tough to put the ball close at times... in essence course is in mid-summer condition minus any draught. The layout/design on a few holes seems more suited or favorable to scratch golfers, but the challenge was welcomed. Definitely would play here again."
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,Unbelievably poor shape. A couple of the fairways were non-existent.
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"went through golfnow.com for tee time there was I spot left and I got it . showed up at course and the three guys I was supposed to play with brought an extra so they let them go out as a foursome kinda leaving me stranded, I didn't want to play alone so I waited and was paired with another threesome, I played terrible but had a great time playing because of my playing partners. the bunkers at this course are absolutely horrible, mostly mud and rocks, bunker play was hit and hopeprobably won't go back this year unless exceptionally great deal"
Coffin Golf Club,545-coffin-golf-club,"Returned after a few years to find a great course, scoring was tough but not the course's fault. Will be back to play in the near future. Tremendous value."
Sarah Shank Golf Course,5811-sarah-shank-golf-course,"Course is a solid Indy public course. Nothing will wow you, but it was a good day on a new course with good conditions."
Sarah Shank Golf Course,5811-sarah-shank-golf-course,"Sarah Shank is a fun little course with quick greens. The course is in pretty good shape for early season, and staff is very friendly. It's an excellent value for 2022 golf under $35 bucks on the weekend when I played it. I always enjoy a go once or twice a year."
Sarah Shank Golf Course,5811-sarah-shank-golf-course,"Course was in great shape. Laid out well. Only negative was we had a very slow 4some in front of us causing a slow pace. Other than that, we had no complaint and will definitely play here again."
Sarah Shank Golf Course,5811-sarah-shank-golf-course,"Shank is a decent muni layout. A little bit of back and forth, but there are a few spots where a creek runs through or there's some elevation change that will keep you thinking. Greens are on the smallish side, but not too tricked up for the most part. There is some evidence of poor drainage/water damage on parts of the course. Won't knock your socks off, but not a bad round either, it's worth a stop."
Sarah Shank Golf Course,5811-sarah-shank-golf-course,"Sarah Shank is a solid public track on the south-east side of town near Beech Grove. The course has a traditional layout with some slight elevation changes throughout the course. The course plays longer than the card says, and the greens were rolling true when I played. We played a weekday twilight and got ahead of a school match. This course is a nice second or third tier course in the area and reasonably priced, I would highly consider a membership to here and Pleasant Run if I lived closer. The staff is friendly and they practice area is well maintained. I love how great the tee boxes always look anytime I play here. The layout is average, but well appreciated by staff and members. It is very walkable, but expect some hills. Well worth giving it a shot especially for the cost and location."
Sarah Shank Golf Course,5811-sarah-shank-golf-course,"I was very surprised, the condition was superb. I have played the course for over 20 years but it had been several years since my last visit. It was great !"
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,"Riverside is a great little course with little extra or fanfare. It’s a place you show up to go play some holes at a very reasonable price. The course is not that difficult, but you can really get yourself in trouble getting behind mature tress if you don’t put the ball where you’re planning. The one thing for me that always sticks out at Riverside is that the greens are beautifully maintained and roll incredibly, especially on the front nine. It’s a shame that the City is closing this course, which is the fourth oldest Muni in the US."
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,This course is in terrible shape something is wrong with the greens it's like playing plinko when your putting. It's hard to tell the fairways from the ruff. There are 2 other courses within a mile of that place .
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,"The large matured tree were calling my balls name all day. Challenging course, but layed out well. Lot of long holes. Was able to use a variety of clubs. Was only able to play 10 holes due to the rain. Grass was high and had a tough time finding balls in the rough. Would like to play again."
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,Fun course with nice greens!! Definitely recommend playing Riverside.
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,"Unfortunately, the fairways were an extreme mess. I would love to play at this course when the grounds are in better shape. The bunkers were extremely hard. The course was fairly easy all holes were straight. I suggest the course for a beginner or someone that wants to work on their short game."
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,"I love this course, it is convenient, old with mature trees.The recent rains have really made things challenging for the staff. I am confident it will be in good shape next year."
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,"Was very suprised by the condition of the course, especially for the 14.00 dollar round of golf thru golfnow. Played the full 18 and even played a few holes twice. Nice course and was wide open. Thank you golfnow, installed the golfnow app on my phone it's my go to for a great deal on golf with a huge selection of nice courses."
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,"I love the course, a nice variety of hole layouts. And 18 is especially neat. Par 3, teeing off 75-100 feet above the green. Great!!However, they need to have better/more ""distance"" markers, for sure. How hard is it to paint a stripe on the cart path. How expensive is it to put a plack on the tee-boxes? Yes, there were 150' markers, but few 100 markers that I could see or find.Plus, we lost or it took forever to find any ball that was even slightly off the fairway. Better maintenance/mowing!But, the course layout is very nice and varied and I like that as opposed to those courses with all their 'straight down the fairway' holes. Price is good and I'm only about 15 miles away.We had hot dogs. I think they had been on the grill for for maybe 6-8 weeks!! HORRIBLE!!! I am sure that last week, they were probably really good. And no raw onion. Bummer!I will be back and hope to see some improvements!"
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,Course is in good shape and everyone frendly. Iwill play this courseagain Next time I am in town.
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,"I like the option to pay in advance. Just when I got to the course the price was the same with no service charge,"
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,I had a great time playing this course yesterday. The course is maintained very nicely considering its fall and leaves are everywhere. I'd definitely play this course again as well as recommend it to others.
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,Always have a great time good greens good pace friendly staff
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,It's pretty simple lay out. Greens give a little challenge. Overall satisfied
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,"Course was in good condition, greens a bit slow. Has been quite a bit of rain in previous few days and may have prevented some greens mowing."
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,Rough was thick and made staying in the fairway a premium.
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,A good course and layout for beginners and intermediate players.
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,"They do a great job at Riverside. Very friendly staff, greens are in good condition and the course can be challenging. A hidden gem for sure."
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,I would recommend this course to anyone.
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,"Great course, decently challenging for a public course. However they allowed a 5 group outing out on the course in the late morning that clogged the entire course up for the day. I spent an average of 10 minutes on each tee waiting to play a hole."
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,Really ruined the pace of my round
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,The greens were a little slow but the course was in great shape for as dry as it has been. Riverside is a short course which makes it a great ego boost for us middle handicappers. It is a great old city course
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,"Great day for golf. Cool temps (70's) in July. Course was in very good shape, considering it is a muni. Low rough, decent fairways and greens were OK. Pace of play was 1 1/2 hrs front, 2 3/4 hrs back. Always seems to be that way. #13 second shot is 115 to 135 yds uphill to elevated green 35/40 feet above grade to a blind pin, and #15 goes left into woods. It can take an hour to play 13, 14, and 15. Watch your ball on the course. An errant shot becomes lost ball found (stolen) by others very quickly."
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,The course was in pretty good shape and the back 9 offers some fun holes that require shots I haven't found on many other course.
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,Thanks to the rain and maintenance crew the course is in good shape. Hole number 5 fairway needs some work.
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,Good course conditions and upkeep. Way better than southgrove
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,Course is great shape for $20 Tuesdays. Staff is inviting and friendly. Play can be a little slow but not terrible.
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,"Nice course for a beginner. No water hazards/obstacles. Couple treelines, but nothing an average player has to worry about. I like this course, but the fairways are the best."
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,"I've played this course a number of times over the years with much reservation due to $ vs conditions... However, the playing conditions were the best that I've seen here in years! Well worth the $18 to ride that I booked via Golfnow!!! The city courses in Indianapolis rate better than most public and several private facilities. Greens were fairly rapid and true, fairways mowed well and pretty even, and the rough is getting thicker. Great fun and challenges for the experienced as well as the newbie golfers!"
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,"I be played this course a lot the past 2 seasons. Still don't know why ""old smoky"" isn't a par 5. The fairways are in great shape right now, not that I hit many of them."
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,I had not played this course in 4 years and found it to be in much better shape than the last time I played. The front nine are relatively easy as compared to the back nine. I found the back nine tougher to play. The greens to tees are a little close on the back nine. The back nine are not as well planned as the front nine as it seemed to be rather close quarters. The wind was near 20 mph so it was tough playing. The greens were in good shape especially for this time of year. In general it is a fun course to play.
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,"Course was in great condition given the time of year and the weather that delayed opening. However, there was no ball washing stations or drinking water."
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,Beautiful day. Course in good shape. I played lousy. Still had a great time.
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,"The greens are in decent shape, but the fairways and tee boxes are not well maintained. Still a great course and great layout. Some challenging holes. Wide open, so not many places to lose balls!"
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,"I play Riverside quite often. The staff is always friendly and for a Sunday afternoon you couldn't beat the price. It isn't a difficult course but if you need a confidence booster, this is the place to come. :)"
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,"This was the first time I have played Riverside in many years. It will be the last time, the course was in terrible shape with more weeds than grass."
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,"Unfortunately, the cart paths are its only good features. The fairways are bare spots and crab grass, greens are rough, there traps are not maintained, and the layout is ludicrous with the front and back nines ending with par threes."
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,"Great course!!! Not a lot of hazards, and the greens were nice."
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,"I will play in this golf course any time any day, all day"
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,It is kinda on the short side but well placed trees makes this course fun.
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,Always have a great time playing Riverside Golf Course. Friendly staff!
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,Course was great but they paired a foursome of us from golfnow up together and then let several singles and doubles off behind us. this became very frustrating as it took almost 3 hours to play nine holes after letting everyone play through. Better course management is needed.
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,"First time playing. Easy 75. Overall-in excellent shape. Fairways and greens very nice. Then we get to the tee boxes......Are you kidding me?! Holes 9 and 18 (both short par 3s) had awful carpeted mats that seemed unnecessary ...? Not sure why they don't replace with real grass, seems like an easy fix...Hot deal on GN made it acceptable.....but those tee boxes on 9 and 18 really ruin the overall appearance and make the course seem junky and cheap."
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,paid $8.00 for cart & green fee on golfnow any more I would felt like I overpaid
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,My friends and I played this course on a weekday for all of $11/person. For the money the value could not be beat. We did however get stuck behind the high school city tournament. This slowed our pace of play down considerably.
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,"Greens and fairways needed grass cut. Rough had very high grass with clumps of cut grass everywhere. Back 9 was in slightly better condition then front 9, but still required additional site work. Some greens had rough and bare spots. Many other courses, in area, that are in better condition, at this time."
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,After a 10 year absence I was plesently suprised at how much fun we had playing the course. I'll be back next week.
Riverside Golf Course,551-riverside-golf-course,mediocre course but a great golf now deal at $9.00 per player. Attendent was very friendly and helpful.
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,For years I have wanted to play here. Why? Because there are four holes in the infield of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"And if that isn’t bizarre enough, there used to be nine!"
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"It’s also why this Pete Dye redux is unfairly labeled a novelty golf course. In 1929, 20 years after IMs opened, the Speedway GC opened as a 27-hole course. A major reconstruction took place in 1993 when Dye waved his wand and shrunk the footprint to merely 18 holes."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"I found the course to be underrated. After two mundane opening holes, Pete starts punching with a short par 4. I think the collection of short 4s here are among his best. The downside is that the par 5s are rather pedestrian save for the 15th, which requires a heroic shot if one is to reach the green in two."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,Dye forces you to make a decision. No blindly pulling driver and sending it. If you don’t execute you can be severely penalized for being on the incorrect side of a fairway or green. The bunkering here is treacherous around the putting surfaces.
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"The price tag is steep, and obviously is geared toward players curious to enter the four-hole gauntlet within the fabled racetrack. Yet, I think it’s worth it. If I had one public round in the greater Indianapolis area it would be here."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"Brickyard Crossing is a 5 star golf experience in every sense. The conditions were just superb today - resort/country club caliber. Everything I saw or experienced was top quality including the customer service. Lots of people there to help out and very friendly. It’s truly sad to see people with bad attitudes drop the rating of a course like this. And you add in the special experience of playing inside a legendary venue like the Indy Raceway, just special. There was a Ferrari driving course going on the day I played, so they were racing around the inside track during the round, extremely cool! I admit in terms of value it is pricey, at least you get a top quality course and experience for the money. Well worth playing at least once. A real pleasure."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"Played on a Friday in Sept, weather nearly perfect. With sunlight getting sparse later in the season, we teed off just barely in time to finish."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"Course bears many of Pete Dye's trademark challenges: misdirection off the tee, bunkers and hazards in just the right places and greens are deceptively nuanced to make you consider throwing a putter..."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"Roger Penske has authorized some changes, things like adding some pot bunkers where there were only normal bunkers before, getting greens more consistent, etc. Nothing dramatic from 2 or 3 years ago. It was a very solid course before, still is now."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"I've reviewed this course before, my attitude remains about the same. This is hands down one of the best courses in the Indy area. There may be more ""exclusive"" places; Indy offers better Pete Dye courses than here. What doesn't happen very often (in Indy) is a top-shelf presentation with top-shelf staff/amenities (esp. when considering a public track)."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"The course conditions are best-in-class all over the place; the tees and greens fully grassed, no blade out of place. By any measure, the fairways and bunkers are upper echelon material. The rough is Kentucky Bluegrass, long, and no easy place to score from, but at least it's dense, consistent and well understood (versus your average public course which is a crap-shoot). If you score poorly at the BY, it's no one's fault but yours; the course is right there for the taking."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"There's a solid reason the Brickyard makes the Best of List for the region. If you've never played, make the jump and come see what a top-shelf facility delivers for public access. It won't disappoint."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,The Brickyard golf course is in the best conditions I have ever seen it in the 10+ years of playing it. The only issue some may have is it is cart path only for the rest of this season that may be why it is so nice. Still worth the $130 walking a little extra they had a few race cars running I think it was the Porsche driving experience didn’t mind the small bit of noise. Staff is top notch 5 stars . I hope to play it 1-2 more times before seasons end.
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"Course was cart part only, I was never fore warned of this . Evidently it has been cart path only all summer.I am better off calling the courses my self rather than using Golf Now!"
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"I played the Brickyard Crossing with two other friends on 09/01/21. Very cool Pete Dye designed course. The greens rolled true and had a decent pace to them. Some of the greens had huge breaks if you were on the wrong side of the cup but were very fair otherwise. The course was in excellent shape. The rough was high enough where you could find your ball, but you still wished you were in the fairway. There are four holes inside The Indianapolis Speedway. Which was pretty cool because on that day we were playing, they were doing some sort of time trails. You can’t see the cars, but you could hear them throughout the whole course. I think it is a very fair course if you play the correct tees. The staff was extremely nice and professional. I would definitely play there again."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,First time for my Dad and 2 friends playing; my Dad has never been on property before (drove in from Cincinnati). I was blown away with the upgrades and the attention to detail around the golf course; evident that Mr. Penske has invested in the course and the staff across the board made the day very special. Golf course was immaculate and the attention to detail on the course with the views/experience of being in/around the iconic IMS will make it hard to play anywhere else. So worth the price of admission; gotta try the Kiss The Bricks slushy drink!!! Thank you all for an absolutely amazing day!
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,What a great experience! I would highly recommend this Pete Dye experience if you’re ever in Indianapolis.Driving under the track of the motor speedway while cars are flying by was very cool.
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"If you haven't played here, you should. I know the green fee is high, but it is definitely worth it. You play 6 holes outside the racing track, 4 holes inside, and come back out and play remaining 7 holes. Excellent layout and condition, I think this course is much better than many of private courses."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,Very nice course and in excellent condition. Single digit handicap and blue tees were appropriate. Course played a bit longer due to recent rain. Initially thought the premium price was the novelty of having 4 holes inside the racetrack however I was impressed with the layout and condition. Added bonus was Ferrari day and was able to get some nice videos or the cars on the track. Only negative was the “Rider fee” of $25 assessed for my non golfing son who accompanied me.
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,I’ve played this course many times. It’s always in great condition.
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,great course.. never disappoints..
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"it’s good to sacrifice 15 yds. off tee, to be in fairway…."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"Whenever I’m back visiting from L.A. I play here. From the moment I got out of my car and a golf cart was driven, I thought, “that’s first class”…the little things. Everyone I encountered was friendly and helpful. The course was in excellent shape. Cart path only that morning but I usually walk so didn’t mind that.. Looking forward to playing again my next visit!"
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,The course is in fantastic shape. Greens are a little firm but roll perfect. The only complaint is I played this course twice in the last week and it’s cart path only only because they laid down a bunch of sod along the cart paths looks great but not much fun walking to your ball all day. The rough is super lush bring some extra balls if easily loose a few in it since you can’t drive to it Overall still glad I played and may play again soon long as it’s not Cary path only.
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"CART PATH ONLY ALL THE TIME , THE ROUGH IS US OPEN ROUGH USING THE CART WOULD HAVE HELPED LOOKING FOR BALLS CANT SEE THEM UNTILL OVER THEM. HAS NOT RAINED IN 4 DAYS . THEY DO NOT HAVE GREEN TEE BOXES AS SHOWN ON CART. VERY NICE COURSE FOOT PRINTS ONLY LOL"
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"Love this course, however, it was cartpath only and from the sounds of it that will go throughout the summer, call ahead to find out the current status!"
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"Was told halfway house would be open at the turn. It wasn’t. Went inside for a moment to confirm it was closed. Upon coming outside after discovering it was closed, I was greeted by a very rude woman who clearly had a bad day. In any event, was treated very rudely by her. Truly unacceptable when you’re paying $130 for a round of golf."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,The course played great however it is cart path only right now while they let the new cart paths and sodding set it. This made pace of play much slower. I do hope they get these things fixed as everyone else I came in contact with there was very friendly and the course is beautiful.
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,Really enjoyed myself with the threesome and I was set up with they were from Chicago going to practice day at the track after they were done playing most enjoyable people that I could’ve been with
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,Golfing while race cars going past you at 200+mph-WOW!!!!
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,I don’t have much to say other than this course is a complete and total pleasure to play and it was a wonderful time.
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,Cart path only isn’t as big of a deal as a lot of y’all seem to be making it :)
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,The course was in excellent condition. Playing inside the Indianapolis Motor Speedway infield was a cool experience but I only need to do it once. You pay for that experience with above average greens fees. I played several other area courses that were just as nice but only charged 50%-75% of the Brickyard greens fees. The clubhouse staff was pleasant but I got the feeling that they thought their venue was better than other area courses.
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"If you’ve heard great things about Brickyard Crossing and were wondering if they were true, rest assured they are. While not as much of a shot makers course as fellow Pete Dye course Fowler’s Mill it still has plenty to challenge you, especially on the tough closing stretch."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"Going inside the track is lots of fun, and they even have an innovative approach to the Covid-ification of the flagsticks where you hook it with your putter and lift up to pull the bottom of the cup up to release your bell. Just let go and it goes back down. The par 3’s are a first class set to boot. The price point is a bit high to play on the regular but it’s well worth it, especially if you’re making a drive from outside the surrounding area."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,An amazing course that should be on your bucket list if you ever are in Indy. I've always wanted to play the Brickyard and finally did so in a memorable round.
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"Had a little trouble finding where to check in but was impressed by how nice the staff was. The course was crowded but that was expected on a warm and sunny Saturday. The first memorable hole was the par 3 fourth, which had a nice view from the tee."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"Heading into the holes inside IMS was an incredible experience and so cool to emerge from the tunnel and heading to the tee box at 7. As we were teeing it up there, I thought to myself ""This is so cool."" The other three holes inside the racetrack were fun to play. Was almost disappointed to finish at 10 and head back to the rest of the course outside the track. A fun round capped finishing up by the big white barn off to the left of 18. The course was in excellent shape and a typical Pete Dye course."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"At the end of the round, we went back into the pro shop to buy some gear. The staff thanked us for playing the course and for purchasing merchandise. Truly friendly group working in there."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,The LPGA has a tournament there in the fall and I look forward to watching the ladies play a course I had an enjoyable round on with my group. A little pricey but well worth it. I would like to play it again soon if I'm back in Indy. Highly recommend the Brickyard Crossings!
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,Course is in great condition except a few bunkers with ground under repair but did not take anything away from play. Manageable layout but as any Pete Dye course can be penalizing but still fun. Cost is a bit on the high side but worth it. The only negative was playing as a twosome 1100 Saturday the round took longer than would have liked. Will not hesitate to play again.
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,I ask the person at the club house if they had a military discount his response to me was why would we. My answer to that question is to look at what all the military does for them during the races with the fly overs and other things that are done. They try to make it look on tv that they are all about the military but to receive the response of why would we truly made me upset. I would have happily accepted no sorry we dont. I have not played the course since that day and honestly dont plan to again. Just for informative value I played there three times last year and have once this year
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"This course was well worth the ten hour drive. I thought the $110 fee was a bit steep at first, but it was worth every penny."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,I found that the greens were very challenging.
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"What a pleasure to finally get to play the course inside IMS. I have wanted to play the course as long as I can remember, and i finally got the chance this spring. The course is Pete Dye at this best. There were ribbon greens and collection areas everywhere. The holes inside the track were really cool to play, and I think anyone coming to Indy should give it a go. I will add this course into my rotation, but the $110 rack rate is a bit steep to play often. Course conditions were solid considering it was early spring. Will be back to see it in full force this summer."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,This is a great course. It was in good shape and the course it self is a great layout. I don't want to call it a hidden gem because everyone knows about it but it cannot be said enough... it is a must play.
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,Pros:- beautiful course that's in great condition- 4 of the holes are in the middle of the Indy Speedway- fairways and greens were in great shape- difficult greens with lots of trouble around the greens- rental clubs were full set of 2018 Taylor Made M4s- GPS on cards- Nice driving range- Friendly staff
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,Cons:- somewhat high on the cost side but worth the price- service at the bar upstairs was a little slow
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,I would say the nicest golf course in the area. I would play this golf course again and again. Highly recommended...
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"I've ben here 3x now in the last few months, i always look forward to playing here. Got to play an outing today, course was in great shape. I was here in March & the Oct. punch on the greens was still around, but today they were great. We had postcard weather."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"We haven't had a lot of rain, so you could tell conditions were a little firmer & fast (which I enjoy). Was surprised by a few employees harping on us for briefly leaving the cart path a few times, as if heading over a very dry hill to drive around people was going to do damage. (A bit much)."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"Grass is always consistent out here, today no exception. I would put the par 3s here up against any course in the area. I dig the volcano green inside the track and even from white tees, all of them play tough."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"Course is doing some renovating, fixing creek area on 15, 17, adding in some stacked sod bunkers (10, 14) which is looking pretty cool. I like how Pete messes with the player off the tee; you'll find out you have room to drive the ball when you get out to fairway."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"Very reccomendable facility, one of my favorite in the area."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"Played Sat morning at 1030a, was just about perfect weather. I usually get our here once a year or so, and this was very much as expected. Course was in great shape (it's fall, so punched greens were in play. Front 9 was punched recently, back 9 was a few weeks ago). Tee boxes, fairways, rough, greens and sand were all top notch. Rough is usually long, so 6in of Bluegrass in some areas made for some punch-out salvages. I hit waaay too many bunkers on the front 9, and can testify they were in pretty good shape. (There were obvious places were golfers hadn't raked. Somewhat surprising at this price point, you'd expect the field to be more aware of etiquette). Pace was just ok - we had groups in front us all day and they played pretty quick. But..."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"We had two groups behind us that seemed to flex between playing as an 8-some and splitting up. Then they started hitting into our group. As in hitting into fairways we were still playing, then hitting into greens we were walking on (rolled into one our putters). Not only dangerous due to flying golf balls, but getting close to flying punches. We had to call the pro shop and get personnel on site to avoid conflict. We learned this was a ""bachelor party"" - clearly they were partying already. I've been to bachelor parties, some including golf; never decided to be RichardHeads for no reason to strangers. Un-excusable. Staff held the little boys back a full hole in timeout (I'm sure the rest of field wasn't thrilled) and we finished the course's great last 6 holes in peace."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"Great Fall day, they were testing Mazda's on the road track, so we got serenaded by raw engine power for a big part of the day. Pete put some railroad ties on this one, and built some nice elevation changes on a few holes (fond of the fall-off areas on this course). Course has a few strategically placed bunkers and water hazards, requiring you to shape a good shot to get a good look. The home holes played into a 1-2 club wind, so that does make them a little more interesting! (I'm talking about you Hole 17...)."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"I always enjoy my time at the course, it's one of the state's best. Conditions being so consistent means you know what you're paying for. Too bad about the clowns behind us, but discounting that trash makes for a great time."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"The course on its own is 4 stars, then add the Speedway and that's half a star. Hitting shots with that background is spectacular. One hole even plays up to the back of the bleachers so you could bounce it off the concrete bleachers and stay in the fairway!Each hole is fun and really solid with subtle turns and elevation. It's a great round of golf, plus several holes in and along the Speedway."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"Was lucky enough to play Brickyard, and am looking forward to returning for another challenge. The course has all the traditional Dye characteristics of undulating greens, paneled sand traps, and deep chipping areas. It is in immaculate shape, and lives up to the reputation its earned as one of the top public courses in the state. The final stretch of holes will test your game after a tough round."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"The price is a premium, and you're paying somewhat for the novelty of playing inside the race track. It is pretty cool when you drive under to play the 4 holes within the walls of the speedway. It's unreal how expansive IMS is. The staff was a bit snooty, honestly, and could've used a smile or something to calm down a bit. Otherwise, it's a memorable experience and one you have to try at least once, even at full freight, if you're in the Indy area."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,How could you not want to play the Brickyard in May? The cars are out on the track qualifying an your can feel it running through your body getting you revved up. The course conditions are great but it would be nice if they could catch the grass they cut in the rough. Wayyyy too much grass on your spikes you have to clean after each shot. The bunkers are great to hit out of an the fairways; the rough was thick and tough to advance in most spots if you find it. The greens could use a touch more speed as they ran a little slow where speeds weren't an issue. The layout is fantastic and the undulations of the greens and fairways add a nice touch.
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,This is a wonderful golf course. The layout is very challenging and beautiful.
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"I have played courses that hosted PGA events and overseas courses that are annual stops on the European tour and the condition of this course is just as good if not better. Absolutely beautiful, smooth fairways and greens! The course is also pretty challenging with big but difficult greens, strategically placed hills and deep bunkers, drop offs, creeks, and lakes. Some of the holes are reminiscent of other masterpieces of Dye's like hole 11...you'll swear it is the 18th at Sawgrass. Being around and in the Indianapolis Motor Speedway (4 holes are in the infield), made the experience even better. The staff was friendly and the GPS-equipped carts made sure for an accurate, enjoyable day. We did wait a minute or two on the group in front of us each hole, but for a Sunday morning with a full course, the marshall's did a pretty good job making sure things moved along...they even asked if we'd like them to go tell the group in front of us to speed up or to let us play through. All in all, definitely worth the $100/round...I am very glad I got a chance to mark this course off the golf bucket list and would like to play it again"
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"Brickyard trades on the name. The golfers we encountered along with the staff very rude. Self entitled comes to mind. RUDE. Very very short. Driver wedge all day over 5 hours to play. The starter stacks you up every 5 minutes its a joke. Front 9 is bland. Back is ok, Was in nice condition but its driver wedge all day and a very long day. Play the Fort or Eagle Creek Sycamore is far harder."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"This is a great course. A Pete Dye redo with 4 holes inside the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Generous fairways and big but difficult greens. A good test from all sets of tees. The last 4 holes are very difficult with a creek being a real problem. #15 is as good of a par 5 as you will ever see. Put it on a lake or ocean, and it would be a classic."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"Treat yourself to this Gem!!! Pristine conditions, fantastic layout, and the history of the Indy 500 echoing across the fairways! Shoot even par on the four holes inside the track and enjoy a golf experience of a lifetime! Unbelievable that a course of this caliber is smack dab in the middle of city streets!!! A real treat... I'll be back!"
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,"The course has some holes inside the Indy track. The first is a par 3 that was very challenging, yet fair. The fairways were generous and the greens fast and well maintained. A very good course and well worth the money. The staff was extremely accommodating and friendly."
Brickyard Crossing,5813-brickyard-crossing,I love this course. Great mix of holes. Great greens that putt true. The three holes inside the track make this course so cool. Great staff that are always helpful.
Thatcher Golf Course,546-thatcher-golf-course,Great family course. Played with our 2 jr golfers and wife. Nice pace of play. Challenging course to work on our shots and club selection. Highly recommend for families and jr golfers!
Thatcher Golf Course,546-thatcher-golf-course,"Got a fairly good deal (60% off) from GolfNow. The course was in real good shape. Seemed laid back and very friendly. Loved the course, even though there is a lot of trees that come into play. I will definitely play here again"
Thatcher Golf Course,546-thatcher-golf-course,"Nice course layout, very tight, but playable and forgiving. Greens were in amazing shape, took brother-in-law for first time and he was very impressed. Only complaint was the some of the branches needed trimming, as they hang just in front of tee boxes where normal ball flight tends to occur."
Thatcher Golf Course,546-thatcher-golf-course,I've played course a couple of times. It's a nice course that is great for beginners or more adept players. Staff is courteous and nice. Had very enjoyable morning and would recommend and play again
Riverside Golf Academy,28992-riverside-golf-academy,"I thoroughly enjoy playing this Par 3 course over lunch as a break from the office. The only downside is that, if there has been much rain, it can be difficult to get from the tee box to the green of hole 6 as the path is often flooded over. Otherwise, it's an affordable, challenging enough course to work on your low iron and wedge play."
Riverside Golf Academy,28992-riverside-golf-academy,"I intend to play here a few times this summer. Only complaint is that the greens need a little work. I think there was a lack of water for some reason and as the greens dried out they cracked near the edges. Fortunately, the holes were placed in better locations so the cracks could be avoided. Watering and repairs have resumed. Looking forward to my next round."
Riverside Golf Academy,28992-riverside-golf-academy,"Never been here before, but would definitely go back. The course was not in great shape, with there being leaves and divots all over the place, but for $5 you can't beat it."
Riverside Golf Academy,28992-riverside-golf-academy,Normally love going to the academy but bad experience this time. Had my 5yr old in toe new clubs and cart and course completely snow and ice covered. Went back after 1st hole to get a bucket of balls and was charged for that also. Total $19 for 1 hole a large bucket of balls. Will consider other courses more often now.
Riverside Golf Academy,28992-riverside-golf-academy,The course goes farther down hill each year. Sidewalks falling into a pond and more goose droppings than grass.
Riverside Golf Academy,28992-riverside-golf-academy,This course is awesome to warmup for a round or night golf !!!!
Riverside Golf Academy,28992-riverside-golf-academy,The staff was amazing !
Pleasant Run Golf Course,550-pleasant-run-golf-course,Lived in Indianapolis 21 years and first time I've played here. Great classic park style design tight up and back fairways. Greens fast and sloped. Fairways well maintained. Great elevation changes on the course. By far the best and most challenging IndyParks Muni I've played. I'll be back for sure.
Pleasant Run Golf Course,550-pleasant-run-golf-course,Plays a little longer than the card indicates. Some very difficult holes buy most are pretty easily manageable. Green have been great. A great place for beginner to intermediate players
Pleasant Run Golf Course,550-pleasant-run-golf-course,The fairways are in awful shape. Some of the holes are odd. Short par 4’s less than 200 yds. The staff isn’t very friendly. Every time we play there they seem not interested in kids playing.
Pleasant Run Golf Course,550-pleasant-run-golf-course,"Pleasant run is a good layout and a great example of an older city course. It has some interesting holes that make pin position really important. The course plays longer than the card says, and it offers quite a bit of elevation change especially for the time of construction. It is a great walking course and the greens are always in supreme shape. The staff is friendly, and the price for a course in the city is hard to beat. PR and its sister course Sarah Shank are a couple of staples in the Indy golf scene for anyone in the area."
Pleasant Run Golf Course,550-pleasant-run-golf-course,"The greens have some undulation and can have a sneaky amount of break to them. A good variety of holes with some short, some long, some tight and some open. Not overly difficult, but big numbers can be made without being accurate off the tee. The graveyard on 15 is a good feature you don't see everyday on a golf course."
Pleasant Run Golf Course,550-pleasant-run-golf-course,"This course has everything I need, some challenging holes yet some that beginners can make par on. Course was nice maintenance seemed up to date and the staff was great didn't even mind we started our 18 a little late in the evening. If you are looking for a good course this was a great value."
Pleasant Run Golf Course,550-pleasant-run-golf-course,"It's a short course but has some challenges for all players. There is trouble if you spray on several holes in the form of woods or mature trees. A stream crosses a few holes, and there is a decent amount of elevation change to add to the challenge. A few greens, like 6 and 7 are extremely sloped from back to front, to the point that pin position placements have to be very limited. Watch out for the road right of 8, and the graveyard right of 15. Hole 12, the #1 handicap hole, would be a legit, tough hole on any course."
Pleasant Run Golf Course,550-pleasant-run-golf-course,"Overall, it was good to sneak out in February and play there while still out of season. It's not a knock-your-socks-off kind of course, and it's not in the best part of town, but it would make for a solid round any time of year."
Highland Golf & Country Club,5805-highland-golf-country-club,"I have friends that are members and worked here in high school. It’s a course rich with history, reflected in the excellent well maintained building, entire course, work out facility w/ yoga room & classes, massage therapist on , tennis academy ( with 10 courts & Pickle ball & 3 Paddle Courts , w heated floors for winter leagues & Leagues for all sports) , new Golf Academy Building w 3,000 plus feet of indoor putting greens, 4 indoor driving range bays, private lesson bays, bar, new lockers for men and women, AND INDOOR VirtuAl reality Driving Range. And the clarify the other review which wasn’t very accurate, felt it was only fair to state facts. Highland is very family oriented and has swim teams and tennis teams for the kiddos, the muiti pools at Highland with lockers and showers and Lifeguard station and Food and Grill also located in the Pool House. The pool house and pool is currently under going an entire renovation this winter, with an amazing and magical place to spend warm summer days around a pool with friends and family. Because like I stated before the staff and members are like extended family. Every guest is greeted with a smile and followed with the question what can I do for you? The Butler Univerity Golf Team uses this course as its home base. As well as other private grade schools and high schools using the tennis courts, Golf, and swimming amenities as Home base for their school sporting events and practices. Highland is an amazing country club overall filled with friendly staff and equally friendly and embraceful members."
Highland Golf & Country Club,5805-highland-golf-country-club,"So before reading a small review from a gentleman who played there once do a lil research of your own. Don’t even take an opinion of someone who worked their 10 years ago and has played and has friends that are currently members and will continue to be, as their fathers, as well as grandfathers are members as well.I live on a golf course with in 5 miles of Highland so I know the difference between a okay course and amazing gem, that given tons of TLC."
Highland Golf & Country Club,5805-highland-golf-country-club,"So sencere, if seeking a membership at a Country Club,.. let me take your to play there and show you all there is to offer."
Highland Golf & Country Club,5805-highland-golf-country-club,"If you want to play this course, just show up and offer them some cash. This place is so hard up for money, they will most likely take it. The golf course is nice, however, the place constantly picks the pockets of it's membership to keep it afloat. The facilities are less than adequate, downright embarrassing. If you know someone that's a member, go try the course. Otherwise, there are plenty of other golf clubs in the area that are MUCH nicer to become a member."
Highland Golf & Country Club,5805-highland-golf-country-club,"This magnificently restored course is a must-play for anyone who can figure out a way to get on. Originally opened in 1919, this Bill Biddle design (with original routing by Willie Park Jr.) has seen its share of legends pass through, including Babe Zaharias, Bobby Jones and Walter Hagen, who reportedly patched up their differences after a tournament here in 1926. A few years ago, however, prolific local architect Ron Kern, who played the course in his youth, was commissioned to begin a restoration that’s still ongoing. Kern sought to bring the course back to its original specs (the greens are the original greens), often using memories from childhood as well as a few photographs and original plans. The result is a classic parkland course with the character that could only be created in a time before heavy machinery. It’s also in perfect shape, thanks to Certified Golf Course Superintendent Ryan Baldwin and his crew."
Broadmoor Country Club,5803-broadmoor-country-club,"The Broadmoor has the friendliest staff of any course I have ever played, and I have been playing for 45 years now. IMPRESSIVE club house. Well stocked golf shop. Brand new state of the art carts No GPS on my cart."
Broadmoor Country Club,5803-broadmoor-country-club,"Classic Donald Ross design, very challenging greens. Would love to play this course more frequently!"
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,It’s in good shape from tee to green and the pace of play was great on a weekday afternoon. A fun course to play and will go there again.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"I played Saddlebrook when it first opened years ago. It served as a great course for my two sons as they began to play when they were 9-12 years old. However, over the years, the course became mismanaged or under kept probably due to budget constraints.I played it for the first time in 20+ years on 9-25-24.I was pleasantly surprised that the greens & fairways were excellent in spite of the recent draught.I was very impressed with the friendliness of the staff too!It was an enjoyable round of golf on a beautiful day before Helene rolled in town."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,The course is in desperate need of water on the Tee Boxes. The pin placement was like Sunday at the Masters and the Tee Boxes were horrible. I play this course almost every Monday for $25 and that is a good deal or Hot Deal on GolfNow but would never pay the normal fee way to high. I will continue to utilize the deals for the remainder of the season.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"I remember when this course first opened. Very nice back then. Unfortunately, this course fell into extreme decline. Guessing there is maybe 1 guy, part-time, at best attending to the course itself. Tee boxes were horrific. Greens not too bad especially in comparison to The Fort that I played a week ago."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Guessing this place is hurting revenue-wise as the most basic upkeep could revitalize this course back into what it once was. Rooting for this course to inject $$$ to just get the greenskeeper some much needed help/assistance to do the most mundane tasks in cleaning up the course.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,“Sand” bunkers? No need to rake them as they are as hard as asphalt with a light dusting of sand granules on the surface. :(
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,I will never play this course again. The pace of play was terrible. There would be 4 carts regularly ahead of us at each hole.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"After 10 holes, I went to the pro shop asking for a rain check to come back to play when it’s not as busy. The shop denied my request."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"As such, I will never play this course again"
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,The course was in great shape. It’s a fun course to play. Highly recommend this place.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Played here while visiting Indianapolis and it was great. The greens and fairways are in great shape, though the sand in the bunkers was very hard. Golf carts are also super slow and I wish they had spread out the par 3’s a bit more as they are heavy on the first nine. Other than that it was perfect to me. Overall it’s a beautiful property and an amazing deal for only $36."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"The course is not bad, but it is not very well maintained. I couldn’t get a tee into the driving range because it was so hard. The same thing happened at several of the tee boxes. The fairways were OK. The course was challenging but fair. The price was really good, so I can’t complain overall."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Greens in excellent shape. Tee boxes totally destroyed. Fairways were pretty good but plenty of divots that weren’t filled. Greens had lots of ball marks-clearly not the courses fault, but the public’s. Good course for the money if you don’t expect too much. Staff great."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"The fairways and greens were in great shape. This course is in better shape than most premium courses in Virginia. Although it is short, the hazards and layout make it challenging and fun."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"They took my cart when i was 2 holes in, they did not take care of the course at all. I would never recommend this ever and please do not give them your business."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Terrible course conditions tee to green. 12” or larger PVC drainage hole off back of 18 green not marked and wife fell in, no apologies, no are you okay, no sense of urgency etc."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,All of the golfing tee time apps should drop this course to save their brand.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Tee box conditions are extremely bad, no grass and on some it was standing water where they put the markers."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Always enjoy this layout - good combo of “gettable” holes and “will get you” holes. Layout is fun!Wish they would keep up the condition better - even just basic things like tee boxes and encouraging players to actually dispose of trash in trash receptacles. :-)
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,If you’re going to drop $50 or more for a round. Find somewhere else with better greens and layout. Great course for beginners or a quick 9.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"The layout is interesting, with a variety of holes. The course yardage is short for the long hitter or low handicapper, but it was perfect for me as a senior. Some holes were quite narrow, with houses on both sides, so it helped that I was driving the ball pretty straight that day. Could be intimidating for a high handicapper. There are a number of water hazards and the greens all have sand traps. The fairways and greens were in very good shape. Some of the greens have a lot of slope and challenge your green reading. I played on a Monday morning and I had the whole place to myself, hardly saw another soul."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"On the downside, the tee boxes were in terrible shape, a sea of divots. It was literally hard to find a level place to stand. Why don’t they have sand bins so you can fill your divots? The two sand traps I was in had a thin layer of sand on top of dirt. I should have chipped out, because there was no way my sand wedge was going under the ball! There are some very long traverses between the green and the next tee, so I wouldn’t like to walk here, despite it not being very hilly."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"But all in all, I will be back, I’m sure. The rates are reasonable for the quality of the course, especially the 12 noon to 2:00 pm weekday “happy hour” and the weekend twilight rate."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Higher rainfall this spring has revealed some drainage problems and muddy tee boxes are bad on holes 7, 8 and 14.The savings by booking online make this course a good value inside of I465."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Average course but is a great deal for the price. Current course conditions are fine but can deteriorate as the season progresses. Although for the price it is hard to complain to much about the conditions. Pace of play has generally been fine on the off peak times when we usually play.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"I found the tunnel under 56th St. to be excellent providing a safe way to cross 56th St. The course was well maintained, especially the greens."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Course layout is good, with a variety of different holes. Greens and fairways well taken care of, and rough is not bad. Good friendly staff. Tyler is friendly, honest, and happy to answer questions"
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,This course looked great. Was very impressed w the condition. We had a blast.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,This is the best shape this course has been in over the last few years. Really impressed with the improvements they made and how nice the course was in. This is a fun course to play.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,The course is quite nice with its set up winding through some water hazards and cutting through the back yards of apparently a few neighborhoods. Worth playing at least once.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Only negatives were the tee boxes were completely abused by divots, no starter, no sand to replace divots, and oh my god some meeeeean pin placements on two holes (fun to a point, but ruthlessly challenging where you would putt up the hill maybe 3 feet high in elevation, and if you missed, it rolls back down about 8 feet. Brutal)."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,This is a great place to play. Course was in great condition
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,All greens were covered in sand and 75% of course was completely covered with leaves.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Very good golf course. Fairways and greens are well kept. Challenging and fun to play
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Great overall course. Wish I had time to play all 18
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Poor course conditions. Not enough carts. Save your money.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"The condition of the course was terrible, it's really gone down hill and you shouldn't be paying $51 for a course in this condition. The Tee boxes look like someone took an ice cream scoop to them . Patrons don't respect he course, by not replacing fairway divots. The greens are in bad shape and the patrons don't repair ball divots. What a shame it used to a nice golf course. I never play there again."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Burned out and weedy fairways. Tee boxes are a broken down mess. Greens..ugh. Burned out dead spots and TONS of unrepaired divots. And the goose poop!! I get you’ll have it in fairways at times. But the tee boxes and greens are loaded. And it’s not all fresh! Does anyone clean up? Does anyone repair the divots? Does anyone at this course give a rats rear? Short answer…NO.This really could be a nice course but it’ll take 1-2 years of real effort to get this course back on track. $45 for 9 holes at this course was a huge ripoff.This course looks like the Sigma Chi house from Animal House! Not only is it in extreme disrepair but the people who play it, abuse it. And clearly not a thing is done about it.Thoroughly disappointed. Until someone cares about Saddlebrook, spend less of your money somewhere else. Anywhere else."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Tee time delayed by lack of cartsEvidently a large # are damaged currently.Tee boxes poor shape generallyGreens bumpySome significant brown areas in some placesHave seen it In better condition before yesterday
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Decent course and a great value. Several short par 4’s. A couple danger spots with uneven pavement on the cart path.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Saddlebrook first off has no guidelines for their cart usage. I paid for a cart, and in 16 years old. every other course lets a 16 year old drive. not saddlebrook. it has 18 year old limit. it did not say anything about this, this would have surely affected my decision. there was also geese everywhere. all on the course everywhere. goose poop everywhere. horrible conditions. finally the driving range was not open for an inexplicable reason. the pace of play was also very slow. will never play again."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Course good shape. Need to find away to get everyone to fix their divots.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Of the available courses in central Indiana, I think Saddlebrook ranks top 5 in regards to quality and value. The maintenance is excellent and it has some gorgeous holes. I’d highly recommend this course."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"The pace of play was extremely slow, even for a weekend. Took over 5 hours to play 18. There should have been a ranger out on the course moving people along. We had a groups in front of us and behind us who were just there to drink and party. I’ll play the course again, but never on the weekend."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,6:40 tee time with a cart got me around in 2hours and 20 minutes. fairways and greens were great. a little behind on the rough mowing and tee box conditions but we’ll worth the fee. i’ll be back!
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Course was challenging, but my largest complaint would be that the people who are playing that course frequently, don’t seem to care about repairing their ball marks. It’s hard to expect your ball to travel on a line to the hole when it is bouncing off line due to deep unrepaired ball marks."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Great experience! Only played 9…Short course but really inviting shots/pin locations.Fairways were excellent and rough was gorgeous (still a pain to hit out of. Greens were in great shape but if you don’t place your approach shots well…goodnite! You have to read the greens very well b/c they will not be forgiving. Had a great time! Whenever im in town i will be back.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Good short course but challenging with narrow fairway at the back 9. Greens are well kept. First time playing here. I will definitely come back.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Course is in rough shape. We played 18 and the snack bar was closed but they still served drinks, so we were starving!"
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Enjoyed playing here but no real prep area for chipping and putting. Course layout features good mixture of open and tight holes. Will play again
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,First of all - I am exploring as many course as I va this year. Pace was great. Course condition below average = dryness in some fairways; greens are slow and show lots of unrepaired ball marks.Layout is great - not long and great mix of open & tight holes. It’s a challenge but you can score!Will play gain
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,1st time.golfer got told.was paired with another and wasn't. Got looked at like I was incompetent when I rold.them its my 1st rd ever and was expected to just know everything
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Although the tee boxes need work. The fairways and greens were in good shape for fall golf. The rough areas are very dried out.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Great layout ! Fast,smooth Greens.If you are not accurate you could be in trouble."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Overall, one of the best public courses in Indianapolis.Course was well maintained, greens are beautiful.Staff was very friendly.Definately worth checking out. Worth the hour drive it took. I would like to go back and play this course multiple times."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,I'm only writing this review so that golfers looking for honest reviews have a good source. The course was a good value for the money....but....it is AT BEST...a 3 star course. The staff is WONDERFUL. The course just doesn't compare favorably to other Indianapolis courses that are getting 4 star reviews. Buyers beware.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,It's OK. Good value for money. Lots of geese. Driving range does not have tees and is pretty torn up.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"The course was in good shape. However, I loved watching a threesome play a scramble in front of me for 12 holes and would not let me play through."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,This was the second time that I have ever played this course. Had a real great time Golfing with a client. We pick-up another Golfer so we had 3 & had a wonderful time hacking the ball around the course. I always love playing Golf in Dry conditions. It was been extremely dry in Indianapolis this summer. The hard ground does wonders for my game & score. Will definitely head back to Saddlebrook soon. Thanks for being a great Host O
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"What a difference 4 days can make. I enjoyed my 18 holes here last Thursday, but not so much today."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Today (Monday, June 27, 2022) I tried playing 9 holes with rental clubs. My tab, even with a senior discount came to $53.60. This was not a good value for the course and included $25 for the rental clubs when I had been charged $15 for the same rentals to play 18 holes just 4- days ago. In fact I was charged $10 more to play 9 holes this time than to play 18- holes last time (and both rounds were a weekday afternoon at 1 PM). Disappointed."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"If you have your own clubs and play 18- holes I'd recommend trying the course. If you are visiting and rent clubs be sure to ask what the charge is in advance. Also, be aware that the charge for 9- holes is almost the same as 18. Good value to play 18- holes with your own clubs, but poor value to play 9- holes with rental clubs."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"My new go-too “Oh I have some time to kill, wonder if I can sneak on this afternoon for $30-$40” type of course. Like the course, both times I’ve been it hasn’t been crowded at all. I’ve only played the first nine both times, it’s not difficult so ideal for the average golfer like me. It does have some water on different holes though which added some to it. It’s a tad dried out, but we also just had the driest month in the past 135 years in Indy, so I appreciate they didn’t waste money/resources trying to keep fairways plush. Greens still in great shape! Overall, you’ll enjoy it."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"I played saddleBrook for the first time yesterday (June 23, 2022). I was very pleasantly surprised, since I had read some negative reviews.Pluses:1. The greens and fairways we're in A+ condition, which was shocking for late June!2. The course is player- friendly, but probably only from the forward ( red and yellow) tees. I highly recommend the course for seniors and women, but not to anyone who plays from further back.3. The staff was friendly, rental clubs were only $15, and there is a discount for seniors.4) My round was on a weekday afternoon (around 1PM) and moved quickly (under 4- hours for a single).5) The front 9 is easier than the back.6. The greens roll true, but are all fast!7. The sand is hard, but you can putt out of most sandtraps, which is nice!"
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Minuses:1. Be careful about when you play and try to pick weekday afternoons. With T- times 8- minutes apart, it can likely get jammed -up on weekends and mornings.2. The course has lots of water and much of it comes into play from the longer tee boxes. There is much less water from the forward tees.3. I liked all the holes except #5, #16 and #18 (requiring carries over water). #18 is a killer hole that requires a lay-up and hitting over water to the green (the only green that does not roll true). Not a happy- ending hole."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Overall this is a course that is conveniently located and definitely is worth trying. I plan to return.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,ProsGreens speed consistency goodFairways very goodConsTypically a 25$ public course only due to nice layoutBunkers poor to need to be filled inTee box’s beat upGreens smooth But would not hold a wedgeSame colored flags on each holeCouldn’t tell from fairways position of holeRed white blue flags would helpCart paths are in serious trouble in some spotsConcession area closed
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"This course has been under improvements since 2018.. There was no marshal on duty to regulate pace of play., several bunkers had no sand or maintenance . Greens were nice and rolled true. Tee boxes were maintained. The course is getting better but there are several areas that could use improvements. It is a fun course."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"I’ve played this course twice this spring/summer and they’re doing a great job improving the grounds! Staff is always friendly and helpful. They could use a ranger on busier days, the back was super backed up. Overall, a great value for the money!"
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Place was awful. All Carts were taken and had to wait 10 minutes past our tee time to get a cart. Then waited 20 minutes on the tee box. ZERO amenities. Wanted beer and water and no one could check us out. ZERO food. Beginners Muni. No need to play here ever again.Oh, geese everywhere, geese crap everywhere. All the water hazards were green stagnant water that smelled like my old dorm room."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Came from Ohio, was meeting a friend in Indianapolis and thought why not, I’ll check out this golf course close by. It did not disappoint! Beautiful course. Will definitely recommend"
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Saddlebrook has a decent layout. Especially for golfers learning the game. It’s just in such poor shape. The greens are bumpy, the fairways are bare in places, and the rough is completely full of weeds. A shorter course that has potential, but it’s so poorly kept that I won’t be back"
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Great layout for a short track if they fixed a few things and the upkeep of the course it could be great. Also we had to wait for a cart could have been semi avoided if they made singles share carts.not the courses fault Also I have never been on a course with so many residents who don’t like golfers. Most no trespassing or private property signs I have ever seen on a course. Even had a home owner throwing golf balls back on the course and complaining about golfers on hole 12
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"played only front nine, back was closed...greens were great!!"
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,hopefully get a refund for the difference
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"I drove in from out of state to play with my son. The day was overcast to start, but by the time we hit the second tee, It was pouring. Everyone came in to the clubhouse for rainchecks or credit vouchers. I never received mine."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"I feel my golf experience would be better if there was a starter that grouped twosomes with threesomes to make foursomes, etc.... I started out with a twosome, had to wait on a foursome 2 ahead. Wait time was 5- 15 minutes between tee off. We invited a single behind us to join our twosome to speed up the play behind us.. This is the slowest play I've had in a long time. This is no way to run a golf course especially sense there was no refreshment cart servicing the course.. It will be a while before I return. I love the challenge of the course. I wish it were managed better."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Not terribly long, even from tips, but a great challenge. Course is well maintained, greens roll very true. It makes you think about your shots, strategize and overall makes for a really fun round. Paths need some work, but course was in great shape."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,ProsCounter person very quick and friendlyGreens as good as I’ve ever seen themPeople please fix your ball marksFairways good3 hour and 10 minute roundConsFront of greens some soft some hard as brickBunkers no rakes to be found15th hole sprinkler on had to play around itMaintenance was on hole and didn’t shut it off
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"The course length may lead some to believe it will be an easy course, but it has some sneaky challenges. A good portion of the holes can get pretty tight with the trees. The greens are faster than most, but aren’t overly difficult. However, the pin positions for our Friday afternoon round were quite challenging. Course is pretty well maintained except for a couple wet/dry spots off in the rough on a few holes. Great for the price; if I travel back down to Indy I will probably try to play this course again."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Got to the course and Pro Shop was wondering why Golf Now allowed me to book 18, Apparently they had a league so only 9 holes were open. We had to play the back 9 twice to get in our 18 holes. As you can imagine with ALL others but league players going off on the back 9 if was extremely crowded and much waiting. Course grass was long - probably due to wet weather."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"90 degrees, high humidity, no outside coolers allowed on the golf course and the only water was at the club house. Completely ridiculous. And not safe."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"The play was good, the whole staff were friendly and helpful."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Not a long course, but pretty tight especially on the back nine."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Do you want to be rushed and judged when you golf? If so go to brickyard. But if you want a relaxed round with excellent libations, go to saddlebrook. . The course is well maintained and the staff is friendly. The most relaxed and enjoyable round in a long time. Well worth the price of admission"
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,I always enjoy playing this course. It seems they have gotten the course back into shape. You will always enjoy playing here
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,When I arrived they did not have my reservation made for 10:10am on may the 16th. I was lucky to get in. Not sure I’ll use golf now again. But course was in great shape and challenging. Great place to play for the money.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Course design was fun, greens were FAST despite early May, pace of play was SLOW, and yardage was short."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Play was a little slow, but the course was in really good shape. Greens were dynamite."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,The course was a little rough. Fairways were good sand traps were terrible And the greens were ok and relatively fast. Pace of play was very good. We enjoyed our round.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"The course layout isn’t the best.. very narrow and sharp turns. The tee boxes were pretty rough to say the least and the same goes for the fairways. If had paid the full price ($35) for 18 with a cart and not the golf now price, I would’ve been even more disappointed. Overall not great but wasn’t bad for the golf now special I received."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Since the new owners have taken over you can tell that much has changed ! I know some things that haven’t changed is how the course is kept up ! 1st fairway is all chewed up since no one is replacing divots and it hasn’t been aurated since November , greens were rock hard like they hadn’t been watered in a month , if the would hire a greenskeeper or someone to help with landscaping and cleaning up a lot of the clutter this place can make money again ! As for the layout it hasn’t changed but the course needs kept up ! To many rock hard spots where you can loose balls with good shots !!"
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"First off, I will strictly play this course if I have some hot deal plus a promo code to get it under $10... and even that is overpriced for the course. Fairways, tee boxes, and greens are very bad and even the rough is a dirt patch. Hole layout on front 9 isn’t completely terrible but wow is the back 9 awful. I went in the other day just for a driving range bucket and they said they just “upped their prices” and I inquired about riding 9 just to see what it was. $28 to ride 9 terrible holes that they simply don’t put any effort on. Several holes have a 1/3 of the fairway roped off as closed."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,December 22nd in Indianapolis is not normally golfing weather but today obliged so out I went!
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Saddlebrook greens were in great shape and extremely fast! You can see where winter maintenance is happening all around the course so expect so less than great lies but overall a great value for the round. Bunkers, as most courses are these days, are not really playable due to time of year and lack of play during COVID."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Enjoy!
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,This course is an excellent value.Love courses like this that provide you options off the tee to layup or carry over water
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"I greatly enjoyed the challenged of this course. The greens were particularly difficult with lots of undulations and for this time of year, they were very fast. Overall, a great experience for the money and I will definitely be back."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Course was overall in fair condition and maintenance was active, but for a Friday in November it was great! Will be back."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"I was impressed with this course because it was well maintained and enjoyable even though this is mid-fall. The green was excellent; the fairway was astounding without leaves except for a few holes in the back nine. The tee box was in good shape, and the service staff was friendly. I will revisit this course!"
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Today the course was either too wet or too dry depending on the spot on the course/hole. Appeared to be a problem with the sprinkler system.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Plenty of challenge especially on the back nine and the course is fun for all. Nice grill where you can get hot food or beverages. Very reasonably priced. Not crazy to see some staff with masks only half on....
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"It is a good course for the Cost, just needs a few tweaks.1. Tee Boxes need some work.2. Traps need more sand."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Fairways and greens were in great shape.Maybe remind golfers to repair Ball marks on the greens.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,We will be back. Thanks
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,We felt save while on the course. Course was in good shape and everyone was friendly and professional.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,I drove down from Noblesville and passed 5 golf courses I’ve played at just to play at saddlebrook. The staff there treats every golfer with equal respect. As a man of color I’ve realized most courses give me the impression thst they don’t appreciate my desire my patronage. Good job saddlebrook you just gsined a new regular golfer! You will be rewarded
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,The round took 5+ hours because the club didn’t have the golf one reservations. They were double booked most tee times so it set everyone way back
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Loved the use of water in the layout of the course.One should never have to use one's wedge on the greens to avoid bunkers. Really, the sand exposed on the greens was better than the sand in the traps, which was like cement. Plus, the staff should explain to 4-somes that hit the ball 50byards off the trees that they might want to consider letting a twosome play through. Ridiculous,"
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Tee box’s goodFairways fastGreens in very good shape ,little firmHad to hit short on some to stay on greensBunkers will be better once they have rakedSome short of sand"
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Overall the course was beautiful! The fairways bounced in my favor and the greens were beautiful and fast. The layout is great and very fun! I'll definitley be going back and playing there!
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Only front nine open city working on cross over to back side tunnelTraps have always been bad hereGreens roll well and not to bad for MarchTees and fairways good shape
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"The conditions on the front 9 are terrific. Bunkers are soft, grass around the green is plentiful and soft, tee boxes are clean. The back 9, on the other hand, could use a little work. A few holes have spotty greens, and many holes have dead spots littering the fairways and areas just off the green. Most of the bunkers on the back are closer to hitting out of a parking lot than the beach. If you keep your shots in the right spot, it’s still a great round of golf for the money, however."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,This has become one of my favorite courses in the Indianapolis area! I love that there’s water to maneuver around on most holes!!!
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Great course for the money. Won’t punish you with distance but requires shot making. Fun overall track and will definitely be playing again.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"This is probably the best course in Indy for the money. I played Community Course is wide-open on front-9 and more challenging on tree-lined back-9. Course reopened 2 years ago after a 2-3 year closure. The greens are true, somewhat fast, course is coming along Great; and you can't beat the $18 Terrific Tuesday special. The Bar and Grill food prices, discounted with round purchase, and various daily specials. Plus food taste great. Want a quick, affordable round in Indy...stop by!"
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,I found the young staff member very friendly and helpful. He took the time to discuss the course history and future plans. The course was in good shape and fun to play. I would recommend playing the course more than once to learn where to place your shot because several of the holes can be deceiving from the box. The front nine is newer than the back and much longer. The greens are small but in great shape. Overall playing Saddlebrook was a good experience.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"My husband and I play every Friday evening with some friends. Course has come a long way since opening in May 2018. Grandstand Bar and Grill has great food, staff and reasonable prices. Well worth the price to play and enjoy food and adult beverages afterwards."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"The course was closed for a couple years prior to reopening a couple months ago. That said, you can't expect much, condition-wise, and I would say give it 2 years before it's back to fully playable. The course is short with some tight tee shots, lots of water, and smallish greens. The front 9 winds through one side of the neighborhood and is fairly open, while the back 9 is pretty tight on the other side of the neighborhood. It does have a design flaw in my opinion in that it ends with a short 4, short 4, par 3, and a short 5. That led to a long backup today even when the course was empty. The front 9 took me as a single about 40 min. The back 9 took 2:45 as I was trapped behind people who were more interested in talking about their round than playing it, nor would they let anyone pass. While there was a starter there was no ranger to do anything about it."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Condition wise, there is a lot of crabgrass around, and the tee boxes and most fairways were pretty rough. The greens were ok, but all had large patches where they have not filled in yet. Many sand traps were unattended and growing grass in them - they need to be fixed or filled in with sod. I know, all of this costs time and money, and if the course invests as time passes it could be good."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"That said, it's not awful right now (like Heartland Crossing was a few weeks ago or Yule after reopening), and the layout is fun/scorable. You just can't expect too much from it as it redevelops, nor would I pay full freight for it. Would be good for beginners who don't care about conditions and seniors who like a short course. Otherwise, give it time and let's see how/if it comes back."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"I am happy that this course has reopened as it is just down the street from where I live. I have played there three times so far this year. The greens are brand new and I am very impressed by them. Most of the bunkers have new sand which looks great as well. The fairways, however, still need a lot of work. This course was closed for over two years and the new owner is doing a great job so far. I will be patient and trust the process. I do feel like the price is a bit high for what you pay for right now, but this is my local course so I will support it as much as I can."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Saddlebrook is where I play almost every week. Unfortunately, they continue to put fertilizer (heavily) all over the course and no water."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"The fairways used to be nice. Now, they are hard and dry as are the sandtraps."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,In many places the fairways are shorter than the greens.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"It is such a nice course, but needs water."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Course condition is very bad. Tee boxes are in poor condition. Many areas of the fairways contain patchy grass over rock solid dirt. Large dead spots on many greens. It's unfortunate as this could be a beautiful course.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,The staff was very absent as well. We wanted to grab some food after our round. We found someone had left there cooler on the counter with a note saying they waited around and no one ever came so they took their cooler deposit out of the tip jar. We also waited around a while and no one ever came in the clubhouse.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Greens were decent, however fairways and anything off the fairway was very hard and in very poor condition couldn't harley get a T in the ground on the Tee Box's. Golf balls would bounce 10-15 feet in the air like they were hitting concrete"
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Overall poor/fair course
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Would not recommend friends or family to play the course
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Fair deal and fair course. Water comes into play on the majority of holes which can be frustrating for the first time player. But another time around and you will have it down. This course is short even from the tips but they make up for it with some long par threes and fours and with some well placed water.The courses greens could have been a little better condition but they were soft and rolling a little fast. I got to play it again because they had no logo balls available when I played.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Could of manage the tee time's better. 3 groups of 4 on the first tee at the same time. Not sure if they were behind or what but didn't look like it.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"It's a challenging layout with the amount of water and proximity to homes , but it is fair and fun to play ."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,The course was in terrible shape. The bunkers had not been raked in days; the greens were rough and uncut and the condition of the fairways was sad.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Otherwise, the day was beautiful"
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,I wouldn't recommend. They didn't have a starter and people came and went as they pleased. They also put people off the front and back despite the fact the course was full. 5+ hour round.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"The course needs better management of tee times and a marshal to monitor pace of play. The course is too short to have 5 hour rounds. The layout of the course is below average and has too many par 3'a on the front 9 contributing to the pace of play issues. If you're a decent golfer this is a drive, wedge and putt course. There was a food discount if you play 18."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,This was my first time coming to Saddlebrook and I can honestly say I really enjoyed this course. The course was in great shape even with all the rain we have had. Major props to the employees. I also really enjoyed talking to the course manager Matt he is a great guy. From the course rangers to the snack bar crew everyone was extremely friendly. I will continue to come back just because of the great employees they have working here.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Course is in great shape considering all the rain this season!
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"I have played Saddlebrook many times. This is a great course for any golfer, amateur to pro. The course is not as long as some links course, but each hole is unique. There are tons of hazards/traps, which make each hole challenging and fun."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Staff is a bunch of inexperienced kids who have terrible attitudes. The course is torn to pieces, the tee-boxs are basically dirt and very uneven. The fairways have divots the size of a prime rib and the greens are slow and filled with divots as well. Residents around the course have no courtesy, shouting and trying to distract you from your game. Pace of play was absolutely pitiful. Waited 15 min at every tee-box."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"I have always liked the layout, location and staff at Saddlebrook. The course has drainage issues with the bunkers; most of the bunkers were full of water. Some areas of the course are in need of repair."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Lots of potential but this course needs a facelift. There were lots of areas all over the course that need maintenance work. Some fairways had major low spots with standing water and mud. The sand traps had standing water on several holes. If they get these issues worked out it can be a really nice course. More than one green had muddy spots. Tee boxes were often littered with broken tees.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Water hazards are atrocious. Sand traps need work. Course needs a lot of maintenance. Condition didn't really affect play. Just went around. The cours is beautiful. Would like to see it in top notch condition.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"This course had several water holes and narrow fairways. It has older trees that have a very solid sound when hit by your ball, The course was very interesting and we had a great day at this hidden gem."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"5 hour round of golf due to extremely slow pace and, even after calling to pro shop to complain numerous times, the ranger still never did anything about it. Not sure if they even have a ranger. There is a sign on the door to the pro shop seeking maintenance help and the course shows it."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Nice course and great price!Was a great day but beware if you book on line at the outstanding price so are lots of other golfers. All good unless someone is in a hurry. Almost 5 hour round is a little long but everyone that was stacked up was cool about it and were there to have a good time.Would recommend to friends!
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Dangerously tight on back nine near homes, and a very tricky finishing hole, but overall a great experience."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Very fun course. Great value. Nice layout. I'll definitely be back multiple times this year
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,First time playing here. Course was in good shape. Definitely would recommend playing early in the morning or twilight if you are worried about pace of play on weekends (tends to be slightly slower than most places). Liked the facilities and felt like it was a reasonably challenging track (almost all holes punish you for going long).
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"White tee box is short and still requires some strategy, short hitters can score on most par 4s and par 5s. Some excellent long drives can actually bring the water hazards into play. Check your yardage to the hazards!"
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Very nice greens and well kept fairways. Not very difficult but yet challenging
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Lets start by saying that I got a GREAT DEAL on deal caddy, If I would have paid full price for this round i would not be happy.I understand that fall/autumn gold can be somewhat difficult at time, however the greens and bunkers were in terrible shape, looked like they hadn't been tended in sometime.I play city coarse 3-5 days a week and they are in considerably betterr shape than SB.I had a good time with friends, but the coarse was NOT UP TO SNUFF!! At this time I would not recommend to a friend, but I do understand it is late in the season."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Every time we play here the pace is SO SLOW and never a ranger to check on things. We have gotten to the point that we will drive further out just to avoid the frustration.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"There had not been rain in at least 6 days. Yet, there was standing water in a couple of bunkers. Also, the back 9 was very soggy and in very bad shape."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"You can see the diamond that this once was, but the years have had a toll on the course and surroundings. Maybe because it is late in the year they have let it go for a bit, but that does not account for the sheds, fences and other surrounding areas of the course. For the money, West Chase or Eagle Creek is a better value."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Not a bad course, but not in good condition except the greens. Bunkers awful antD those not torn up looked as if they had never been raked."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Course has a nice layout and nice holes. Unfortunately for the price it fills up quick. Get out early to beat the hackers. One of my favorite public course especially for the price.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Play was too slow due to the number of players on the course.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Location is fine, course is good shape (minus the sand traps) great daily prices! Good deal all in all"
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,I have played this course many times in the past and always enjoyed it. Got a Great Deal on GN. It had rained a lot this past week and #14 Tea Box took a beating. A couple of the greens are rough and some traps are being redone or removed but over all fairways were good.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Remember to always Fix Thy Divot
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Played this on a Sunday morning after a huge rainstorm the night prior. While the course certainly took on a larger than expected amount of water, the drainage was somewhat lacking as there were a number of areas of standing water even by late in the morning.I've played this course many times and recommend to always play early if you don't want the round to take 5 hours +"
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Greens were awful and pace of play was awful. Also, most bunkers were being constructed on. Overall bad experience."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"I signed up for 18 hours through golfnow. The course is generally in good shape, with the occasional bald spot here and there on the fairway."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,The greens are in good shape and predictable. Some of the cart pathways are broken - requiring you to drive around the 3-4 large depressions. Not a show-stopper.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"The Par 5's are not that hard, and Par 4 are average difficulty. Overall a great value for $30. I would go again to this course."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"This would have been a much more positive review if this hadn't been the slowest round I've ever played. They apparently stacked up the tee times. Our twosome was stacked between three foursomes. We had to quit after it took 3 hours to play 9 holes. We sat at the tee for over 15 minutes at more than one hole. The weather was beautiful, the course condition was better than average, and the company was good. I would stay away from this course on weekends, I would not be surprised if they commonly stack the tee times."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"The bunkers are unplayable, like most courses around town. The greens were horrendous also. It's a tricky, tight layout I like, but I can't go back till I hear they've made an attempt to get the course in shape."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"First time I played course. Short course that compensates by having water in play on most holes and a few tricky greens. Other than 2 greens on the back that were diseased, course was in good condition."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Fairly tough course, nothing extremely challenging but overall Saddlebrook will get my money again. Greens weren't great but weren't nearly as bad as some I've seen."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Greens are in bad shape, fairways are chewed up, maintenance is an overall issue. Staff were extremely friendly, but this doesn't make up for the mediocre conditions."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Nice layout and good condition for a public course
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"The greens and other areas used to be littered with goose feces, but the birds are not numerous so far this year.A few tees, a few fairways, and a couple of greens are a bit spotty. The traffic lights for the tunnel under 56th St. have been fixed."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Very pretty, more dynamic holes than you can find aroud Indy for the price. The back nine plays through a neighborhood (a few holes on the front, too), which made for more nervous play - a party was going on, I was waiting to miss hit the ball into a child. But otherwise a great round!"
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"I thought the course was interesting. There were quite a few holes that required thought and decision making and I enjoyed that aspect of it. The back nine is much tighter and more difficult than the front. Fairways were in good condition, tees were OK, greens were fairly slow and had a lot of little brown patches that made for some difficult putting."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Nice easy short course. Great average golfer golf course, everything was in good condition but most of the holes were pretty short. Not a great course for the long range drivers. Fun course, nice layout, good speed of play, overall good time."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,I booked the round on Golf Now for 8:24 the morning after I arrived. My clubs did not arrive on the flight with me. Called the club that morning at 7:00 and asked for a later tee time as I needed to go buy shoes. The pro was very gracious and accommodating. The first impression when I drove up was not great but the course was in great shape and challenging. The pro was even gracious enough loan me his towel as the rental set was just the basics.. I look forward to my next trip to Indy so I can take on this course with my clubs.
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"This was the perfect day for golf and the course was in great shape. After a very slow twosome was passed, we moved at a great pace without any issues. Both front and back 9's offer some fun challenges and opportunities for birdies."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Great course, will challenge all levels! Highly recommend this course."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"I really liked the course. Lots of water / sand. Play was at our pace. Greens have a lot of levels.Car paths need some attention. No yard makers. Makes approach shots difficult !!Overall, I would recommend the course. Got the green fee on line (golf now) for $26.00."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"This course is close , convenient and really very affordable (especially with deals from golfnow). There is also a good mix of challenges on the course, some holes are open and require you to hit a long driver, others will require more thought that would require a long iron. The holes are nicely laid out and present unique challenges. The biggest drawback to this course is the condition that the course is in. Bunkers are mostly unplayable, poor turf condition, uneven tee boxes, the list goes on. I know the staff does everything they can but this course gets so much traffic and so many people dont respect the course that having the course in this condition is inevitible."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,Decent course helped me score back to back birdies for first time in 2014
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"I'm not sure what the regular green fees are for Saddlebrook, but booking it on Golfnow was certainly a great value. Granted it was a Monday, but being able to play 18 w/cart for around $20 is right up my alley. That price did not reflect the quality of the course which was for the most part in really good shape. The bunkers needed some work, but maybe if I stayed out of them it would not have mattered. Golfnow has made it possible for me to play more golf and not put a strain on finances, get the app, use it...Go. Play."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"This is a nice course with an interesting layout. It is in decent shape, but the pace of play was ridiculous. 6 groups were waiting to tee off at the same time (8:30 am). Eventually, everyone spread out, but one group held everyone up. No ranger was to be found. Two groups caught up with our group and quit after waiting to tee off for 15 minutes. 5 1/2 hours to play this course is unnecessary."
Saddlebrook Golf Club,5798-saddlebrook-golf-club,"Was pleasantly surprised by how great of shape the greens and fairways are this year. Played this course many times and have always disliked the overall quality of most fairways, greens, and tee boxes, but today the fairways and greens were as nice as any top public course. Bunkers were awful and unplayable, with the hard clumps of sand and rock everywhere. Tee boxes were in mediocre shape. Can't beat $18 twilight. N"
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"Really enjoyed my round at Southern Dunes. The course was in immaculate shape: tees, fairways, and greens. [I avoided the traps, so I can’t speak to those.] The holes have a lot of variety. Although there are hazards, the landing areas are large enough to provide a bailout. The greens were very fast compared to those I have played recently and a couple of times I was shocked when my approach shots rolled off the back or off the sides of the greens. The greens have enough slope to keep you on your toes without being ridiculous. Despite there being houses near the course, there was enough separation that they were intrusive; they didn’t made you feel as if you were playing in someone’s backyard, which is the case at some Indy courses. In fact, the way the course is laid out I was rarely even aware of players on other holes. The layout is a little unusual: 34-36 with 6 par 3’s and 4 par 5’s. The back 9 has 3 par 4’s, 3 par 3’s, and 3 par 5’s! It would not be a good course to walk: there are several very long treks between the last green and the next tee. The senior weekday rate was very reasonable for the quality of the course. I played the front 9 in one and a half hours and then foursomes slowed things down on the back nine, but I still finished in four hours. This was a weekday, so I can’t speak to the pace of play on weekends."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"The first cut rough is literally crab grass even just off the fringe of the greens. There were several groups of 6 or more all over the course. I was a single golfer. Un-real! They have a “ranger” but he lets this go. It’s one of the more expensive around, go figure. Not good won’t be going back. It’s like going to a restaurant and then having a stranger seated at your table."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"First time playing the 18 hole course. We had played the par 3 before. Not too crowded for a holiday. Tee boxes and fairways nicely trimmed. Too many unrepaired ball marks on the greens - golfers’ fault. One green appeared to have had a vehicle driven on it in the past and is still healing. Lots of lakes on the course which test your nerves. Plenty of decisions need to be made to lay up or go for the glory. Nice variety of holes, in a links style layout. Good pricing through the week for us old guys. Holiday pricing was fair, and included a sleeve of balls. Would play here again for sure."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"I had heard some good things about this course and thought I’d give it a try. I will say the clubhouse looks impressive from the outside but on the inside, there was a lot of empty space."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"Got paired up with a married couple that were a delight. Seems like they play the course semi-regularly as they were quite helpful with where to aim. On nine, someone behind us hit a snap hook off the tee that nearly hit my cart. No. 12 was a LONG and straight par 4 that seemed like it should be a par 5 from most tees. No. 15 might be the most interesting on the course with a short second over the corner of a lake."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"The layout was pleasant with water coming in to play on a decent number of holes. However, the greens looked bad and dead in spots. I was told they tried to expand the size of the greens but instead they killed them, especially on the edges of nearly every green. The bunkers had almost no sand in them and instead had big rocks or even chunks of asphalt."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"Seems like it was a good course but has really gone bad recently. Has the potential to return to what it probably used to be. Not sure I'd ever play there again, so once is probably enough, especially as a visitor to the area."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"I have played this course several times, and this was by far the worse condition I have seen it in. I honestly hate giving this review!"
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"1. Greens were in terrible shape, with a lot of damage.2. Hole cuts were terrible, the depth of the cup was inconsistent, and you could tell they had not been changed in quite some time.3. The fringe was overgrown with weeds or damaged.4. Sand traps were mainly rock with no sand5. Tee boxes were not mowed, and were patchy. Tees were placed in the more weed infested areas making it very difficult to find a decent spot to tee from.6. Lack of water on course (regarding for drinking)7. Fairways were mowed far too late and lots of clumps of grass were remaining making it difficult sometimes to even find your ball in the fairway."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"Again, I have loved this course for years. This was just sad to see."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"I've played this course about half a dozen times now, so i feel comfortable giving a healthy assessment of the course. The layout is fantastic with lots of forced carries over lakes and ponds, the greens are moderately sized with a good amount of slope to them, and the course has a fair amount of bunkers."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"There was a fair amount of water damage when we played, but to be fair this was the worst spring i can remember. The grooming is average, and the bunkers could use substantial work. The club house is huge but has sparse amenities."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"I played with DrOldSchool when he wrote the review below in 2017. My brother in law and i jumped on the deal advertised on facebook for this season and we have given southern dunes a go twice now. The course has been in solid shape this spring. The greens are much healthier than 2017 and they have rolled well. Id like to see them a little faster, but come midsummer I'm sure I'll get more than I asked for. There is so much water on this course, and I am pretty sure I've been in every pond on the course. The staff is friendly and this course easily has one of the best layouts in town. I am curious to see how it holds up as the season goes on. Should make for a great course to play this season!"
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"This course is fun and very challenging. A lot of water in play. Course is pretty dry, the ball rolls out 25-50 yards on the fairways. Greens are very fast. With normal rain this course would be beautiful. I will definitely be back to play again!"
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"This course has so much potential, it's a shame what it is right now. The layout is a lot of fun with water in play on several holes. But the greens, rough, and tees boxes are all in very poor condition. Several greens have giant patches on them where the are either completely browned out, or sand has been placed and they didn't even mow. The rough is patchy at best. The tee boxes appear to have some sort of disease as many of them are wasting away to nothing. Even the good ones are very brown. The sand traps were basically hardpan throughout as well. The fairways were ok though."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"My playing partner and I both agreed this could be up with the top tracks in town if they put some money into it to repair what is going bad because the layout is so nice. The sparse clubhouse and conditions suggest money problems though, so who knows. I'll give it another go next year to see how it's doing. But it's just sad to see what it is now."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"This course was one of my favorites on a recent trip to Indianapolis. Clubhouse looks like an southern mansion, inside it's not as extravagant but still very nice. Driving range and putting area were nice, carts seem new and plenty of yard markers on sprinkler heads which are easy to find. Nice layout to the course. I thought is was challenging yet very fair. Fairways were in excellent shape and so were the greens. You can see the layout of each hole as its played and aren't surprised by any hidden hazards. You're not too far from downtown yet it feels like you are far away. I played in a scramble so we paid more than normal, but the posted prices were between $35-$40 for 19 with a cart. Very good value. I would play this course again in a heartbeat."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"The course was in great shape. It's very challenging but very fair. I had never heard of this course before and thanks to the reviews from this site, I added it to our list of courses for our father-son golf trip. The staff was very friendly. The only drawback was the pace, and we were behind an outing, so that was not the course's fault. Will definitely play again."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"I love Southern Dunes. It was described to me as deceptively short and thats very accurate. Everytime I've played the course it has been in excellent shape. A couple of really challenging over water holes, and some short-cut par-5s make for an interesting round mentally and physically. Pair this course up with Heartland Crossing for a weekend golf getaway and thank me later."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,Friendly staff and a very playable course for all skill levels. The course is in amazing shape so early in the season. I'll definitely play here again!
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,I haven't played here in a few years but I really enjoy this course. I wish the weather had been better but the course itself was in good shape and pace of play was great.
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"Tee boxes were a little rough, but probably from being played so much."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,This was a great course. Fairways and greens were in excellent condition. Would highly recommend this course.
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,Outstanding facility. Challenging enough for great golfers but friendly enough to cater to the moderate player. Having previous knowledge of the course helps you score better. Course has an easy way and hard way to play. Your score will reflect if you know ball placement. Booking time on Golf Now is the best. Only reason golfers are not using this app is they don't know about it!
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,Really liked the course! Cups on the greens needed to be moved.Lots of traffic around certain holes.Tee boxes needed help also. Plenty of sand and water. Pretty course to play on.The club has a lot to offer ! The price was right too !I will definitely be back.Marc
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"Impressed with the improvements at Southern Dunes since earlier this year. Greens, fairways, and tee boxes were all in much better shape than 2 months ago, which is shocking if you consider that it's now the middle of August."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"Southern Dunes remains one of the top 5 courses on Indy's southside. Well done management team and staff, well done."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,Course was great except bunkers had very little sand
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"The course was in great shape. We started not long after an outing had finished so there was some traffic wear on the greens but due to the good condition of the course they were still in great shape. The staff, particularly the person working the cart area, was very accommodating and ensured we had carts that were clean and had charge enough to get us around the course without any problems."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,Had a great time on the back 9 shot 42 which is good for me I look forward to playing again.
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,Great condition. Fast playing tee times. Can't wait to play again.
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,The tee stations were a bit roughed up from a large outing but the greens were is good shape for the traffic they got. Brian and his crew always do a great job keeping the course playable and the greens in top condition.
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"I have played here for several years in the past, and this was my first time here this year.I must say, that tee boxes are in absolutely terrible shape! Nearly every one is tore up, and need to be completely redone.Also, the green side bunkers are like hitting off of pavement. I know a load of sand is not very expensive, so I fail to see why this is the case.I have refused to play other courses around (Tameka Woods for example), due to these same type of issues.I hope this can be resolved, because I really like playing here, however I do not want to pay to play a course that is not what it should be."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"1st time playing this course but not the last. Great links style layout. Had rained hard 2 days previous so wasn't getting the roll you like on links but course was well drained and probably played great the next day. Wife played and found it lady friendly . Only complaint was indifferent youngster working the pro shop, but that kinda seems to be the norm anymore"
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"I purchased a real good deal from golf now $12 for a round. The course was in great shape, fairways wide, the approach shot challenging with greens surrounded by water, fescue and sand with the occasional extended first cut and greens not fast with nice turns. I really like this course it is not extremely long and has a links feel. Good course for south side of indy. In the neighborhood it's a definite play."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,if your looking for a well manicured course this is it. you will not be dissapointed
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"Multiple hazards, some tight fairways, and huge greens."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"The staff was extremely nice to us, especially the lady that was working as ranger. We met some people that lived on the course that were also very friendly. We feel this is the nicest golf course we play considering price. While they definitely packed a lot of golfers in there, it was Friday afternoon in June! Other courses turned us away from being full and they found us a spot. Thanks!"
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,Great conditions & shape I've seen SD in 4 years or more....
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,The range was in great shape. The rest of the course was in really good shape as well.For the price I paid through golf now($18) it can't be beat.
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"Great layout and the staff takes great care of the course, but it appears not many players on the south side have ever heard the saying ""leave the course in better condition than you found it"" something I was told when I was first learning....... Also the gentleman at the pro shop had me feeling that my buying a shirt and asking the clubs price of various balls was a bit of an annoyance and that I best be moving on. I also I found the price of golf gear to be a bit pricey compared to other clubs on the south side. I liked the greens, I will be back and would recommend playing here at golfnow pricing of course! SW"
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"The course was cartpath only and with 21 mph winds, 34 F and to add to this snowing sideways in middle of April... I still had a great time.. I was the only person playing, imagine that?? Course was in great shape considering everything else.."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"I just picked up the game last year, and this is one of my favorite courses to play."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"I was leary about playing here because I don't usually enjoy housing addition courses (homes too close, too many members cause over crowding, etc.). This was the exception. Holes are spread out nicely, hazards are well placed, and the staff couldn't have been nicer. I will go back."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"I played a round of golf in Indiana on December 1st!!!!Hey Southern Dunes is one of my favorite courses to play. It is challenging but if you get hot you can go low on this course. I see this course as two separate 9's. You have to survive the front 9 and then feast on the back 9. Designed by one of the all time greats Gary Player. Go try it, you will like it!"
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"The course tests your shot accuracy. Even though it has few trees, it penalizes poor shots very well. I would suggest you take plenty of extra balls. The rough does a good job of hiding them and there is plenty of water to avoid."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"I played this course in 2005 and I believe in 2008. The course was beautiful, obviously still fairly new back then. This outing was the opposite. I don't know if last years summer really is to blame for all the damage on the course, but I doubt it. It had rained quite a bit the night before and there is no way it shouldn't have been cart path only. But knowing better I stayed off. However you could see where other carts were just tearing up the fairways. Tee boxes were destroyed and many had weeds growing on them. Almost every green had large bare spots. For the price, it's simply not worth it. Even cheap rates off of Golf Now don't detract from what this course looks like. Hopefully something will change. I won't go back for some time."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"The club house was pretty sweet, stocked with Nike gear and a indoor putting surface. Then you get to the tee boxes and they're junk and the greens could use some TLC. Other then that not bad."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"Though it's only a par 70 and isn't terribly long, Southern Dunes presents a fun challenge for golfers of all abilities. The pace of play was a bit slow when we played due to a scramble-style golf outing, but the course was in decent shape. Some of the tee boxes had been aerated recently. Better yardage markings and/or GPS units in the carts would be helpful."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,Played from the tips and course was slightly challanging. Course does have lots of water but only forced to carry water on a few holes. The fairways were well maintained and some greens were a little spotty and needed help. Overall nice cource for the money.Staff was friendly and were available to answer all questions.Very good experience overall.
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,This used to be one of my favorite courses to play but something has happened in the last year. I can excuse the tee boxes being worked on but the fairways need a lot of work and the greens were in AWFUL shape. There were brown patches of dead grass on everysingle green. to put it in perspective the greens at BLUFF CREEK GOLF COURSE are in better shape. If i had paid full price for this round i would be a lot more upset instead I don't think I will play there again for a couple of months.
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,The course was in decent shape but nothing spectacular. I liked the layout and a lot of the holes. If the fairways were in better condition it might be worthy of 5 stars but not until the fairways are filled in. I would play here again.
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"played here nov last year, was in better overall shape...Came with friends this trip all were not pleased....several fairways littered with divots.....greens ball marks...it will be a while for us...sorrry still enjoy the venue"
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"Ive played Southern Dunes a few times and the course has always had its inconsistencies from hole to hole. Some holes will be heavily watered and extremely soft and others will be hard, dry, and fast. Some greens are well maintained and others will be partially fried. All in all its not a bad course to play has some degree of difficulty scattered throughout the course but still could use a little work overall."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,Course is very well kept this year. Good condition. Would definitely play again.
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"Without GolfNow, we certainly would not have chosen Southern Dunes. However, because of the great deal, we did choose Southern Dunes, and now we plan to return to the course several times in the future. The double-sloping greens, water, and sand bunkers made it a beautiful and challenging experience."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"Over all not bad, front nine greens were hard and not easy to hold even with solid struck shots, almost like they hadn't been watered for a couple days, back nine was better. Enjoyed the day decent little course. Think it could be a real challenge from the tips. Only real pet peeve was the extra par threes that are not typical, Par 70. They had the room to make some of the par threes par fours and it would be a lot more enjoyable. Just a personal thing of mine."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"Friendly staff, well maintained course. Would like to see marshal come out every once in awhile to advise slower groups to play at quicker pace."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,This Course is Beautiful Rolling Hills and Awesome Lakes.. Fairway are in Great Shape and The Rough is just that ! Make you wish you Hit Straight all the time.. All though not knowing the course an being my first time there was an Awesome time.. The Clubhouse is Big an has everything you will need for the game.. The indoor Putting Green is something to see.. Good Luck and Try this Course you won't regret it....
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,great track.......a hidden beauty....big greens...plays longer than the yardage....great practice facility....multiple tee's to choose from......one of my fav's
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,Challenging but definitley not a walkers course. Very long between greens and the next tee box. I would advise them to cut down the very tall rough some to speed up play. Alot of time is spent by average golfers looking for balls.
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"The course is always challenging to play. Tight fairways make accuracy crucial. The greens were maintained, although they could be a little fuller. We played from the Blue Tees. The tee boxes need to be leveled off. All in all, the course was in good shape and made for a fun round."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"I usually love this course and always find the condition to be really good no matter the time of the year. However, this time we teed off around 9 am and it took us almost 5 1/2 hours to play. We ended up just driving around and goofing off the last 4 holes because the pace of play was unbearable. No Marshall to be found on the course. At several points in time there would be 4 groups of players on a given hole. One on the green, one in the fairway, and two on the tee box."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,We play this course every couple of weeks. Consistently maintained.
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,I really enjoy this course. It is always well maintained and the greens really roll true to form. I always seem to find amazing deals on this course on this website. Keep it up.
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"There is literally water everywhere on this course. You must be accurate off the tee and not intimidated by water - I'm neither accurate nor not intimidated so I had a rough day. Not to mention it was 40 degrees and incredibly windy. Due to the weather I'm not sure I have an accurate reflection of the difficulty level but it seems like a really tough course, if you're a beginner, look elsewhere. Otherwise the course is challenging, well maintained and a good value for the money."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"The layout is decent. Although it was early in the year, the course was in rough shape compared to the other course we played. Decent layout. Booked for a great price. Would definitely not pay full green fee to play. Many other courses in area I would go to first."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,This was my first time playing the couarse. My coworker Jim and thought that it was challenging with the water hazards. The greens were challenging also. We look forward to bringing and will recommend others to the course.
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,"My brother, son and myself really enjoy this course. You can and will use every club in your bag. The course was in very good shape inspite of our weather this year."
Southern Dunes Golf Course,29713-southern-dunes-golf-course,They need to spread out the tee times a bit. Had to wait to tee off on every single hole.
The Country Club of Indianapolis,547-the-country-club-of-indianapolis,"Very honored to be the first to review! It was a privilege to play the Country Club of Indianapolis today. Total 5 star golf experience all around. This is a Palmer Advantage Club, so I brought a friend and played with my membership from my club. We were treated like special guests at every point. Great place to play. Details follow if interested."
The Country Club of Indianapolis,547-the-country-club-of-indianapolis,"The drive through the gate presents a classic, stately, tree-lined entry. There were plenty of polite young people there ready to assist with clubs and cart, so first impression was superb. Very courteous welcome at the pro shop with very easy going pace. Driving range and practice green were all first rate. Greens rolled so nice and fast I was sure I would make a bunch of putts (I didn't but my friend rolled the rock great and sank some nice putts). The course was very memorable. Lots of terrain, big beautiful trees, and a creek that seemed to run throughout. Course amenities were excellent, with front 9 coming back to the club house for mid round refreshments. Probably the most memorable thing was the tee box on #11 that wraps around a large tree in a horseshoe shape. Very unique and Horsehoeesented a stunning look. Several holes finish on top of a hill (including 9 and 18), giving a real challenge of club selection. Just had a great day and look forward to going back as a Palmer Advantage member. Thanks Country Club of Indianapolis!"
Hillcrest Country Club,5806-hillcrest-country-club,Beautiful wooded park land golf course. It is in great shape with no poa in greens. Great walking course.
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"Really enjoyed my round at Southern Dunes. The course was in immaculate shape: tees, fairways, and greens. [I avoided the traps, so I can’t speak to those.] The holes have a lot of variety. Although there are hazards, the landing areas are large enough to provide a bailout. The greens were very fast compared to those I have played recently and a couple of times I was shocked when my approach shots rolled off the back or off the sides of the greens. The greens have enough slope to keep you on your toes without being ridiculous. Despite there being houses near the course, there was enough separation that they were intrusive; they didn’t made you feel as if you were playing in someone’s backyard, which is the case at some Indy courses. In fact, the way the course is laid out I was rarely even aware of players on other holes. The layout is a little unusual: 34-36 with 6 par 3’s and 4 par 5’s. The back 9 has 3 par 4’s, 3 par 3’s, and 3 par 5’s! It would not be a good course to walk: there are several very long treks between the last green and the next tee. The senior weekday rate was very reasonable for the quality of the course. I played the front 9 in one and a half hours and then foursomes slowed things down on the back nine, but I still finished in four hours. This was a weekday, so I can’t speak to the pace of play on weekends."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"The first cut rough is literally crab grass even just off the fringe of the greens. There were several groups of 6 or more all over the course. I was a single golfer. Un-real! They have a “ranger” but he lets this go. It’s one of the more expensive around, go figure. Not good won’t be going back. It’s like going to a restaurant and then having a stranger seated at your table."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"First time playing the 18 hole course. We had played the par 3 before. Not too crowded for a holiday. Tee boxes and fairways nicely trimmed. Too many unrepaired ball marks on the greens - golfers’ fault. One green appeared to have had a vehicle driven on it in the past and is still healing. Lots of lakes on the course which test your nerves. Plenty of decisions need to be made to lay up or go for the glory. Nice variety of holes, in a links style layout. Good pricing through the week for us old guys. Holiday pricing was fair, and included a sleeve of balls. Would play here again for sure."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"I had heard some good things about this course and thought I’d give it a try. I will say the clubhouse looks impressive from the outside but on the inside, there was a lot of empty space."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"Got paired up with a married couple that were a delight. Seems like they play the course semi-regularly as they were quite helpful with where to aim. On nine, someone behind us hit a snap hook off the tee that nearly hit my cart. No. 12 was a LONG and straight par 4 that seemed like it should be a par 5 from most tees. No. 15 might be the most interesting on the course with a short second over the corner of a lake."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"The layout was pleasant with water coming in to play on a decent number of holes. However, the greens looked bad and dead in spots. I was told they tried to expand the size of the greens but instead they killed them, especially on the edges of nearly every green. The bunkers had almost no sand in them and instead had big rocks or even chunks of asphalt."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"Seems like it was a good course but has really gone bad recently. Has the potential to return to what it probably used to be. Not sure I'd ever play there again, so once is probably enough, especially as a visitor to the area."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"I have played this course several times, and this was by far the worse condition I have seen it in. I honestly hate giving this review!"
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"1. Greens were in terrible shape, with a lot of damage.2. Hole cuts were terrible, the depth of the cup was inconsistent, and you could tell they had not been changed in quite some time.3. The fringe was overgrown with weeds or damaged.4. Sand traps were mainly rock with no sand5. Tee boxes were not mowed, and were patchy. Tees were placed in the more weed infested areas making it very difficult to find a decent spot to tee from.6. Lack of water on course (regarding for drinking)7. Fairways were mowed far too late and lots of clumps of grass were remaining making it difficult sometimes to even find your ball in the fairway."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"Again, I have loved this course for years. This was just sad to see."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"I've played this course about half a dozen times now, so i feel comfortable giving a healthy assessment of the course. The layout is fantastic with lots of forced carries over lakes and ponds, the greens are moderately sized with a good amount of slope to them, and the course has a fair amount of bunkers."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"There was a fair amount of water damage when we played, but to be fair this was the worst spring i can remember. The grooming is average, and the bunkers could use substantial work. The club house is huge but has sparse amenities."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"I played with DrOldSchool when he wrote the review below in 2017. My brother in law and i jumped on the deal advertised on facebook for this season and we have given southern dunes a go twice now. The course has been in solid shape this spring. The greens are much healthier than 2017 and they have rolled well. Id like to see them a little faster, but come midsummer I'm sure I'll get more than I asked for. There is so much water on this course, and I am pretty sure I've been in every pond on the course. The staff is friendly and this course easily has one of the best layouts in town. I am curious to see how it holds up as the season goes on. Should make for a great course to play this season!"
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"This course is fun and very challenging. A lot of water in play. Course is pretty dry, the ball rolls out 25-50 yards on the fairways. Greens are very fast. With normal rain this course would be beautiful. I will definitely be back to play again!"
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"This course has so much potential, it's a shame what it is right now. The layout is a lot of fun with water in play on several holes. But the greens, rough, and tees boxes are all in very poor condition. Several greens have giant patches on them where the are either completely browned out, or sand has been placed and they didn't even mow. The rough is patchy at best. The tee boxes appear to have some sort of disease as many of them are wasting away to nothing. Even the good ones are very brown. The sand traps were basically hardpan throughout as well. The fairways were ok though."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"My playing partner and I both agreed this could be up with the top tracks in town if they put some money into it to repair what is going bad because the layout is so nice. The sparse clubhouse and conditions suggest money problems though, so who knows. I'll give it another go next year to see how it's doing. But it's just sad to see what it is now."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"This course was one of my favorites on a recent trip to Indianapolis. Clubhouse looks like an southern mansion, inside it's not as extravagant but still very nice. Driving range and putting area were nice, carts seem new and plenty of yard markers on sprinkler heads which are easy to find. Nice layout to the course. I thought is was challenging yet very fair. Fairways were in excellent shape and so were the greens. You can see the layout of each hole as its played and aren't surprised by any hidden hazards. You're not too far from downtown yet it feels like you are far away. I played in a scramble so we paid more than normal, but the posted prices were between $35-$40 for 19 with a cart. Very good value. I would play this course again in a heartbeat."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"The course was in great shape. It's very challenging but very fair. I had never heard of this course before and thanks to the reviews from this site, I added it to our list of courses for our father-son golf trip. The staff was very friendly. The only drawback was the pace, and we were behind an outing, so that was not the course's fault. Will definitely play again."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"I love Southern Dunes. It was described to me as deceptively short and thats very accurate. Everytime I've played the course it has been in excellent shape. A couple of really challenging over water holes, and some short-cut par-5s make for an interesting round mentally and physically. Pair this course up with Heartland Crossing for a weekend golf getaway and thank me later."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,Friendly staff and a very playable course for all skill levels. The course is in amazing shape so early in the season. I'll definitely play here again!
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,I haven't played here in a few years but I really enjoy this course. I wish the weather had been better but the course itself was in good shape and pace of play was great.
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"Tee boxes were a little rough, but probably from being played so much."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,This was a great course. Fairways and greens were in excellent condition. Would highly recommend this course.
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,Outstanding facility. Challenging enough for great golfers but friendly enough to cater to the moderate player. Having previous knowledge of the course helps you score better. Course has an easy way and hard way to play. Your score will reflect if you know ball placement. Booking time on Golf Now is the best. Only reason golfers are not using this app is they don't know about it!
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,Really liked the course! Cups on the greens needed to be moved.Lots of traffic around certain holes.Tee boxes needed help also. Plenty of sand and water. Pretty course to play on.The club has a lot to offer ! The price was right too !I will definitely be back.Marc
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"Impressed with the improvements at Southern Dunes since earlier this year. Greens, fairways, and tee boxes were all in much better shape than 2 months ago, which is shocking if you consider that it's now the middle of August."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"Southern Dunes remains one of the top 5 courses on Indy's southside. Well done management team and staff, well done."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,Course was great except bunkers had very little sand
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"The course was in great shape. We started not long after an outing had finished so there was some traffic wear on the greens but due to the good condition of the course they were still in great shape. The staff, particularly the person working the cart area, was very accommodating and ensured we had carts that were clean and had charge enough to get us around the course without any problems."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,Had a great time on the back 9 shot 42 which is good for me I look forward to playing again.
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,Great condition. Fast playing tee times. Can't wait to play again.
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,The tee stations were a bit roughed up from a large outing but the greens were is good shape for the traffic they got. Brian and his crew always do a great job keeping the course playable and the greens in top condition.
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"I have played here for several years in the past, and this was my first time here this year.I must say, that tee boxes are in absolutely terrible shape! Nearly every one is tore up, and need to be completely redone.Also, the green side bunkers are like hitting off of pavement. I know a load of sand is not very expensive, so I fail to see why this is the case.I have refused to play other courses around (Tameka Woods for example), due to these same type of issues.I hope this can be resolved, because I really like playing here, however I do not want to pay to play a course that is not what it should be."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"1st time playing this course but not the last. Great links style layout. Had rained hard 2 days previous so wasn't getting the roll you like on links but course was well drained and probably played great the next day. Wife played and found it lady friendly . Only complaint was indifferent youngster working the pro shop, but that kinda seems to be the norm anymore"
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"I purchased a real good deal from golf now $12 for a round. The course was in great shape, fairways wide, the approach shot challenging with greens surrounded by water, fescue and sand with the occasional extended first cut and greens not fast with nice turns. I really like this course it is not extremely long and has a links feel. Good course for south side of indy. In the neighborhood it's a definite play."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,if your looking for a well manicured course this is it. you will not be dissapointed
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"Multiple hazards, some tight fairways, and huge greens."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"The staff was extremely nice to us, especially the lady that was working as ranger. We met some people that lived on the course that were also very friendly. We feel this is the nicest golf course we play considering price. While they definitely packed a lot of golfers in there, it was Friday afternoon in June! Other courses turned us away from being full and they found us a spot. Thanks!"
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,Great conditions & shape I've seen SD in 4 years or more....
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,The range was in great shape. The rest of the course was in really good shape as well.For the price I paid through golf now($18) it can't be beat.
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"Great layout and the staff takes great care of the course, but it appears not many players on the south side have ever heard the saying ""leave the course in better condition than you found it"" something I was told when I was first learning....... Also the gentleman at the pro shop had me feeling that my buying a shirt and asking the clubs price of various balls was a bit of an annoyance and that I best be moving on. I also I found the price of golf gear to be a bit pricey compared to other clubs on the south side. I liked the greens, I will be back and would recommend playing here at golfnow pricing of course! SW"
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"The course was cartpath only and with 21 mph winds, 34 F and to add to this snowing sideways in middle of April... I still had a great time.. I was the only person playing, imagine that?? Course was in great shape considering everything else.."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"I just picked up the game last year, and this is one of my favorite courses to play."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"I was leary about playing here because I don't usually enjoy housing addition courses (homes too close, too many members cause over crowding, etc.). This was the exception. Holes are spread out nicely, hazards are well placed, and the staff couldn't have been nicer. I will go back."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"I played a round of golf in Indiana on December 1st!!!!Hey Southern Dunes is one of my favorite courses to play. It is challenging but if you get hot you can go low on this course. I see this course as two separate 9's. You have to survive the front 9 and then feast on the back 9. Designed by one of the all time greats Gary Player. Go try it, you will like it!"
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"The course tests your shot accuracy. Even though it has few trees, it penalizes poor shots very well. I would suggest you take plenty of extra balls. The rough does a good job of hiding them and there is plenty of water to avoid."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"I played this course in 2005 and I believe in 2008. The course was beautiful, obviously still fairly new back then. This outing was the opposite. I don't know if last years summer really is to blame for all the damage on the course, but I doubt it. It had rained quite a bit the night before and there is no way it shouldn't have been cart path only. But knowing better I stayed off. However you could see where other carts were just tearing up the fairways. Tee boxes were destroyed and many had weeds growing on them. Almost every green had large bare spots. For the price, it's simply not worth it. Even cheap rates off of Golf Now don't detract from what this course looks like. Hopefully something will change. I won't go back for some time."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"The club house was pretty sweet, stocked with Nike gear and a indoor putting surface. Then you get to the tee boxes and they're junk and the greens could use some TLC. Other then that not bad."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"Though it's only a par 70 and isn't terribly long, Southern Dunes presents a fun challenge for golfers of all abilities. The pace of play was a bit slow when we played due to a scramble-style golf outing, but the course was in decent shape. Some of the tee boxes had been aerated recently. Better yardage markings and/or GPS units in the carts would be helpful."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,Played from the tips and course was slightly challanging. Course does have lots of water but only forced to carry water on a few holes. The fairways were well maintained and some greens were a little spotty and needed help. Overall nice cource for the money.Staff was friendly and were available to answer all questions.Very good experience overall.
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,This used to be one of my favorite courses to play but something has happened in the last year. I can excuse the tee boxes being worked on but the fairways need a lot of work and the greens were in AWFUL shape. There were brown patches of dead grass on everysingle green. to put it in perspective the greens at BLUFF CREEK GOLF COURSE are in better shape. If i had paid full price for this round i would be a lot more upset instead I don't think I will play there again for a couple of months.
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,The course was in decent shape but nothing spectacular. I liked the layout and a lot of the holes. If the fairways were in better condition it might be worthy of 5 stars but not until the fairways are filled in. I would play here again.
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"played here nov last year, was in better overall shape...Came with friends this trip all were not pleased....several fairways littered with divots.....greens ball marks...it will be a while for us...sorrry still enjoy the venue"
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"Ive played Southern Dunes a few times and the course has always had its inconsistencies from hole to hole. Some holes will be heavily watered and extremely soft and others will be hard, dry, and fast. Some greens are well maintained and others will be partially fried. All in all its not a bad course to play has some degree of difficulty scattered throughout the course but still could use a little work overall."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,Course is very well kept this year. Good condition. Would definitely play again.
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"Without GolfNow, we certainly would not have chosen Southern Dunes. However, because of the great deal, we did choose Southern Dunes, and now we plan to return to the course several times in the future. The double-sloping greens, water, and sand bunkers made it a beautiful and challenging experience."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"Over all not bad, front nine greens were hard and not easy to hold even with solid struck shots, almost like they hadn't been watered for a couple days, back nine was better. Enjoyed the day decent little course. Think it could be a real challenge from the tips. Only real pet peeve was the extra par threes that are not typical, Par 70. They had the room to make some of the par threes par fours and it would be a lot more enjoyable. Just a personal thing of mine."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"Friendly staff, well maintained course. Would like to see marshal come out every once in awhile to advise slower groups to play at quicker pace."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,This Course is Beautiful Rolling Hills and Awesome Lakes.. Fairway are in Great Shape and The Rough is just that ! Make you wish you Hit Straight all the time.. All though not knowing the course an being my first time there was an Awesome time.. The Clubhouse is Big an has everything you will need for the game.. The indoor Putting Green is something to see.. Good Luck and Try this Course you won't regret it....
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,great track.......a hidden beauty....big greens...plays longer than the yardage....great practice facility....multiple tee's to choose from......one of my fav's
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,Challenging but definitley not a walkers course. Very long between greens and the next tee box. I would advise them to cut down the very tall rough some to speed up play. Alot of time is spent by average golfers looking for balls.
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"The course is always challenging to play. Tight fairways make accuracy crucial. The greens were maintained, although they could be a little fuller. We played from the Blue Tees. The tee boxes need to be leveled off. All in all, the course was in good shape and made for a fun round."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"I usually love this course and always find the condition to be really good no matter the time of the year. However, this time we teed off around 9 am and it took us almost 5 1/2 hours to play. We ended up just driving around and goofing off the last 4 holes because the pace of play was unbearable. No Marshall to be found on the course. At several points in time there would be 4 groups of players on a given hole. One on the green, one in the fairway, and two on the tee box."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,We play this course every couple of weeks. Consistently maintained.
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,I really enjoy this course. It is always well maintained and the greens really roll true to form. I always seem to find amazing deals on this course on this website. Keep it up.
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"There is literally water everywhere on this course. You must be accurate off the tee and not intimidated by water - I'm neither accurate nor not intimidated so I had a rough day. Not to mention it was 40 degrees and incredibly windy. Due to the weather I'm not sure I have an accurate reflection of the difficulty level but it seems like a really tough course, if you're a beginner, look elsewhere. Otherwise the course is challenging, well maintained and a good value for the money."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"The layout is decent. Although it was early in the year, the course was in rough shape compared to the other course we played. Decent layout. Booked for a great price. Would definitely not pay full green fee to play. Many other courses in area I would go to first."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,This was my first time playing the couarse. My coworker Jim and thought that it was challenging with the water hazards. The greens were challenging also. We look forward to bringing and will recommend others to the course.
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,"My brother, son and myself really enjoy this course. You can and will use every club in your bag. The course was in very good shape inspite of our weather this year."
Southern Dunes Par-3 Golf Course,29712-southern-dunes-par-3-golf-course,They need to spread out the tee times a bit. Had to wait to tee off on every single hole.
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"Not a single hole had an actual fairway. Essentially, you are hitting into an open field of rough and raw patches of dirt and weeds - zero differentiation between the “fairway” and the rough. The bunkers were full of rocks, not pebbles: rocks. Only hit out of them if you plan to buy new clubs after the round."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"The only saving grace for this course is the greens were in decent shape, though they were slower than a standard fairway on any other course. For $40+ per round, there are FAR better public courses in the area."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"For the level of my ability, this was a fine course to play. It's just really straight and doesn't have much personality in the holes. There are several holes you're playing down one fairway while other golfers are playing up the one next to you."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"Cart paths were terrible in several spots.Fairways were in okay shape, but could use some weed spray...greens were in pretty good shape and some were very challenging due to pin placement today. We were told the Club Championship was being played that afternoon and they were obviously trying to make it difficult as they could. Cups were set very close to where their were ridges, making putting touch a real key."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"Would I play here again...sure, I'm working on my game and this is a decent place for a +20 HDCP-er. I'm not interested in paying more than about $35 here though."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,For $26 a person you can’t expect a PGA worthy course. Fairways were difficult to see because of lack of mowing. Polish sausage was good in the clubhouse.
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"The Carts were all on their last leg. The layout of the holes was fine until hole 9 when you were constantly playing the opposite direction of people to you left and right. The paths and bridges look like they were maintained by Joe Dirt, and the greens and fairways were TERRIBLE, debris everywhere and grass too tall making it impossible to find your ball."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"What makes this course somewhat challenging are the greens, they are fast and alot of undulation. Fun"
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"Steve and Chris, father and son, are doing a great job to keep a local family owned business going. I’ve been a member here for several years and enjoy the family oriented atmosphere. They also partner with Washington Twp schools to use their course for golf teams. Great place!"
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,Been playing here for over 5 years. The staff has always been great! The course is challenging but fair. the greens are also challenging. The cost to play is excellent! The pace is great - hardly ever have to wait. Highly recommend this course!
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"This course is the perfect get away from the hassles of life. Beautiful pines & nature everywhere, get lucky & see some deer. Course owner & founder Steve is always around & treats regulars like gold. Course is family owned & operated…great place to be a part of. Many leagues available. No place I’d rather be golfing. Thank you Steve & family for making the great experience available to all! See you soon!!"
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,Course is not very well maintained.. Very dry and rough
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"The course is not kept well. No real fairways, the greens were average, tee boxes sub par."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"The cart paths are a fun adventure, however the greens were great! Several fairways kinda blend a little bit. Interesting water hazards."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"Do I think the course is as bad as some people make it out to be? No, I’ve certainly seen worse in the area. That’s not an endorsement though, fairway and rough are indistinguishable and the layout is VERY straight, which gets made up for with some absurd greens which seemed to vary in condition and speed from hole to hole. Desk worker wasn’t the friendliest in the whole world either, kinda acted like having business was a bother. On Mondays it’s 22 which seems about right, any other day when they’re charging as much as nicer courses I would avoid though."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"This course is very walkable. Carts were provided in pricing though. Some fairways are a bit narrow, but I didn’t lose a lot of balls. Finished round in 3.5 hours,so good pace. Fairways have some crabgrass but greens were fine. Good course for beginners, or more experienced player who just wants to get out, without spending a fortune. Overall we enjoyed it and would go back."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"Good course if you want to play cheap. Do not expect it to be in great shape. Fairways were extremely dry, but the greens were in good condition. Tee boxes are horrid."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"This is a poorly marked golf course. There were a couple times I could not find where the next hole was as their cart path takes you in multiple paths without any signage. The price is less than what you expect in the surrounding area but still is not worth it. The fairways were something you would expect from a par 3 or exec course. The clubhouse is less than desirable. The only positive I can give this course is that the greens were well kept. Otherwise, go elsewhere."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"I felt like I got my moneys worth and more! Very friendly, and a great ice cream parlor afterwards"
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"Seen other reviews saying negative things, but with golf often even mediocre courses are overpriced. This is a good value price for playing golf, and the course isn't bad!"
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,It’s at best a practice course. Should be around 10-15 dollars. All course conditions weren’t nice. Essentially park grass. This is a last resort type of course or for beginners.
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,Pace of play was perfect until hole 6 when they decided to paint the greens. We had to wait for them to finish that up. Once they finished then we had to wait behind a group of players that were going pretty slow the rest of the day. The course was in decent shape. Honestly a perfect course to play at for your first time out this year.
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"After playing a few courses in the area, Morningstar might not be the most upkept course there is, but it’s definitely challenging. The par 3’s are very tight off the tees. The greens aren’t flat, and make you have to play safer shots to avoid doubles and triples. All in all, course is a 4/5 during season."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,Carts are old and need of repair. Needs an infusion of funds to get to a n acceptable level. Other courses around to play.
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"While the course was not that bad, the Greens themselves were indeed the highlight of the round/trip. While the Greens were soft, they also had multiple shelves, increasing the difficulty of the hole and adding to the challenge of the round. There a re a couple of holes with a creek running across the approach and the mature trees add to the difficulty and make it a narrow course; all not bad things to have. I think with a little more time and attention to the fairways and tee boxes, this would be nice East side course. I will give it another look next year, as I am from Ohio."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"The tee boxes were in horrible condition, the fairways were covered with white clover weeds that made it extremely difficult to find your ball. The greens were nicely designed but 75% of them were diseased or badly damaged. Will never go back until they put forth an effort to drastically improve the course conditions."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"I will never place this course again! It is unkept, from Tee boxes to greens! It’s not marked well we were always trying to figure out where the next hole is. The tee boxes are over grown, the tee markers are hard to see and the blue and white are together! The course overall is not maintained well, we spent more time looking for balls then playing! My group was almost hit on at least 4 separate hole with flying balls, nobody yelling “fore”. the group behind us were hitting into us. It was a horrible experience!! Not worth it when there are many other courses around Indianapolis."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,Rough and fairways were playable. Greens were very long and slow. For $37 I would recommend playing sahm or winding ridge where the balls actually rolls.
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"This course has the potential to be great. But the upkeep is not great. It seems as if they left the sprinklers on overnight on and around the greens, it was a mud pit. A few of the cups were full of water. Grass on many of the fairways was nonexistent. Cup locations on some of the holes also did not make sense at all. There were also no signs directing you from one hole to the tee box of the next."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"Like I said, if the right person took care of this course, it would be great to play on. But for $25-$30 bucks it is not worth the money."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"I hate to say it, but you get what you pay for. I believe a round was $28/person including the cart. I usually can expect what to see or play on for that price, but this was a little unsatisfactory for me."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,The lady at the front desk wasn’t very welcoming and seemed though as if she didn’t want to be there. She was on her phone a lot and her body language/tone didn’t express any positivity or joy of being on a golf course. This is where most men/and some women come to escape negativity/reality!
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"I saw some reviews talking about the golf carts and our experience wasn’t any better. We had leaves and dust everywhere on our cart and after placing my phone on the deck of the cart, I picked it up to find so much dirt on the back of it."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,The tee boxes weren’t terrible but at times we had to struggle to find where they were located. We usually tee off from the white markers but even some of those were tough to find. I wish I had taken pictures to show.
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"Most fairways were fine but others was like playing off of dirt. To be honest, the greens were the main issue for me. I posted some pictures below. Enough said."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,The cart paths were interesting at times. Some parts didn’t even have a path and some bridges looked like they were going to collapse any second. Be careful!
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"Overall, I think this course needs some TLC and some new upgrades to the clubhouse. The menu was okay but everything was frozen and cooked via microwave. Some of the views were nice but I doubt I’ll come back in the future. I can’t see the value driving 40 min from my house to play there any time soon unfortunately."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,Hope this review helps.Happy golfing!
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"Horrible conditions. Tee boxes, fairways, and greens are absolutely horrific…. Worse course I’ve played in awhile."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"Fairways just short of terrible, your shot could be right in the middle of the fairway and not find it."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,Prepaid for 2 on Golfnow on Friday. Drove 50 minutes to the course to meet my friend and get there to find out that a Bad Thunderstorm hit the night before and caused enough damage to close the golf course. We had to call several other courses to find another tee time.
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,The holes were filled with water. You could not tell the difference between the fairway and the rough because the grass hasn’t been cut in a long time. Sand traps were unplayable. Just an awful experience
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,There is a reason this course is only $22 dollars for 18 holes on a weekend. It’s not a bad course by any means it’s just not as kept up as the others in the area. Some holes it was hard to differentiate the fairway from the rough. Staff is great owner is a nice guy. Course layout is not to difficult.
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,There is no difference from the fairway and the rough. There are large portions of a couple of the putting greens that are bare dirt.
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,We found this course to golf with a young 14 year old girl who loves the game. It was a great course for that. A little bit long as far as most fairways but we had her start a bit closer to the tee and she did just fine. Lots of water to play over and we did lose a couple of balls but had fun! I plan on golfing there again when in Indy.
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"Poorly marked course as far as tee box directions, poorly marked tee boxes, difficult to differentiate fairway from rough, literally every hole is completely straight."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,Hot dog was decent.
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,Good course some tough pin placements good value for the money
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"No change from fairway to rough throughout the whole course. Even some tee boxes felt like you were hitting out of the rough. Sprinkler heads on the green. Went in at the turn to order a burger, they had to remind them to heat up the burgers taken from the freezer...still came out frozen in the middle."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"The staff was wonderful, very friendly and nice people. Course is just in terrible condition."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,fun course to play. always moves fast. great staff.
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,Tight Course which Makes You Hit the Ball Straight!
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"Great shape for an inexpensive course, but fairways are tight and unforgiving, so make sure you bring plenty of extra balls"
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,The owner was very nice. The players were very friendly. We played with little delays between holes. Good mix of Par 3s and Par 5s.
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"I paid for 18 and played 11 as a single rider playing so. When I arrived there was 2 threesomes waiting to tee off so one of the workers told me to play the back 9 first which was great. I flew thru it, no one in front or behind. Once I arrived on the front 9 I waited on the first hole for 15 minutes before I could tee off and continued to wait after every stroke. I played 2 holes before I had enough. Did not go in and complain because it's pointless but thought I would leave a review. The course layout was okay, very straight with nothing challenging. The greens were very rough on every hole I played. For being the ending of May the greens should not be in that shape. The staff was very nice though, that was the one positive. It was a one and done for me, no desire to return there."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"I play this course often. Grass is always cut, easy to find my ball when I have a bad.shot. Dry condition has hurt some greens. Great course to work on my game."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"The fairways are like hitting a ball in your backyard. Bent grass and hard dirt. You won’t be taking a divot. The greens need cleaned off. You’ll spend a few minutes clearing a path for your putt on each hole. Most of the holes look and feel the same. Uninteresting. Luckily there was hardly anyone out there, so we could play at our own pace, but I’m guess the lack of attendance is due to the fact that this course is bad. I guess that’s why it’s only $14/rd. We won’t be coming back."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,Course is showing damage to dry hot weather. Owneris doing a good job with the greens
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,We did not play!!! Error-made - wrong state - cancelled-
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,Course is in great shape. Loved the greens.plenty of challenges and easy to walk
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"Course was just okay. The greens were over watered and most of the holes had sitting water inside the cups, very weird. Tee boxes were fair, very few memorable holes. Cart paths were in awful shape. Most Fairways were dry and hard to distinguish from the rough. Overall I cannot recommend this course to any serious golfer."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"Not a bad course, there are some spots that need work but they are making progress. Good value for the price and my only complaint is that you have basically 5 holes that are the same, split fairway, 225 off the tee with a creek crossing and a tight entrance to the green. Fairea6s are tight and the greens are in good shape."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"Can't say enough about this place and the gentlemen running it. Our daughter has attended numerous camps here and she loves it every time. The coaches are great with children/youth and they are instilling a passion for golf to our future generations. She's now receiving lessons from a PGA Professional here at Morningstar, playing for her school team, and competing in competitive play with the Indiana Junior Golf association. We love this place for our children as well as for our personal play!"
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"Their pricing is great, for play and for club orders/fittings, lessons, etc. They recently got an indoor simulator as well, but we haven't had a chance to play on it yet."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"In terms of the grounds: We've been here a couple of years now and I've seen the staff working tirelessly to enhance the greens. The improvement is noticeable, including trimmed-up trees, etc. Cart paths are still older but the Golf Carts are brand spanking new! They ordered new ones last fall."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,I frequently recommend Morningstar to anyone that asks where we golf. They've become like an extension to our family!
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"This course straight open fairways which is great for beginning and intermediate golfers. The cart paths need work, but the course is in great condition. A great value for the green fees."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,Poor maintained. Cart paths bad. Lots of bare spots. Worst course that I have played.
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,I have been playing golf for over 20 years and THIS course is the worse by far. The grass in the tee boxes was so high it was hard to find a spot to tee off. The fairways were like playing out of you're back yard. I paid $13 dollars to much. The only positive was it was not busy. Depending how you play you could play 18 in 2hrs. Sad to see a course in this shape no excuse. Will not return
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,Lots of lay up and shoot across the creek to small greens. Course just needs some tlc and grass growing.
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"This is the worst golf course I have ever seen or had the displeasure of playing. The course would have been easy, with super straight holes with no doglegs or challenging obstacles. But it was the most low maintenance place I have ever been to. You could barely even tee up because the tee boxes were as tall as your backyard you haven't cut in two months and the fairways were as tall as the rough should be. There was junk and debris all over the holes and especially on the greens which made it impossible to sink a putt. The golf cart roads were completely covered in potholes and cracks."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,Loved the course and will definitely play it again and again
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,I have been golfing since I was 12 years old and I can honestly say this is the worst course I have ever played. The tee boxes had grass higher than the rough. The greens were filled with small rocks and dried worms to the point where you couldn't even putt. The grass on the greens were the length that the fairways should have been. You couldn't even figure out where the tees were located on the tee box until you walked up to look for them because they were buried off the box in high uncut grass.
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,We had to change carts before the round even started because it wouldn't even drive until after you kept pumping the gas pedal 5-6 times.
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"This course was not even worth the price of admission. With all conditions as is, a round of golf with cart should be no more than $10"
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,Great course to play plenty of water hazards. Greens are a challenge.
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"The greens were in surprisingly good shape, but on most holes the tee boxes were unkept and all in one spot (red/white/blue). The fairways weren't much different than the first cut of rough. For the price I guess this should be expected."
Morningstar Golf Club,15050-morningstar-golf-club,"Will never go there again, really been let go, basically a cow pasture."
Maple Creek Golf & Country Club,5808-maple-creek-golf-country-club,Invited by a member and was very excited to play Pete and Alice Dye's first 18 hole designed course. Very well kept course. Great greens and nice fairways. Staff was very friendly. Trying to play all the courses on the Pete Dye Trail. Glad I got to experience and play this course.
Maple Creek Golf & Country Club,5808-maple-creek-golf-country-club,"I love this place, i played it when it was semi private in 2014. Now it's all private, but they offer very affordable membership packages. It has an old school feel but the members are all down-to-earth fun guys. A few younger members as well. The course is tree-lined and in pristine condition. The greens are some of the best rolling that you will play on in the city. it challenges you to think about your shots off of the tee, instead of just pulling out your driver and Swinging away. It is a shot Shapers course, and I'm sure that playing here frequently will vastly improve my mid-iron game. I can't wait till it greens up this spring. It's my Augusta National on the east side of Indy."
Maple Creek Golf & Country Club,5808-maple-creek-golf-country-club,"This might be Pete Dye's first course, but it reminds me of a Donald Ross; smallish greens with shallow greenside bunkers, and every fairway framed with trees (hence the name of Maple Creek due to all the maples#. Greens is great shape & I'm not just saying that because I had only 27-putts; but you do have to keep it outta the rough. The ball was tough to see in the bright glistening afternoon sun #no complaints here) and a lot of leaves, which they will get after next week. This course has a lot of grass, fairways & rough;; so we'll come back .....especially at the great GolfNow price."
Maple Creek Golf & Country Club,5808-maple-creek-golf-country-club,"Pete Dyes first 18 hole course but different than newer courses no pierd bunkers not that its easy, if you think it is move back to back tees. Many times going though narrow trees to greens or fairways.really injoyed playing and will play again."
Maple Creek Golf & Country Club,5808-maple-creek-golf-country-club,"Tight course for me, great practice round. Really have to pick your clubs wisely and shape the ball. Very challenging, only drawback was that the bunkers were like cement. Too bad the GPS on the carts have been taken out."
Maple Creek Golf & Country Club,5808-maple-creek-golf-country-club,"I had very high hopes for Pete Dye's first 18-hole golf course, especially for an average rate of $59 per round. Luckily I only paid half that. The greens were slow, the fairway was not very well maintained, the layout was very confusing (no way to tell which way to get to next hole, sometimes a few hundred yards away). I can tell the course used to be nice, and we play all around the city and I can tell you there are other courses that are worth more than this one. Not one of Pete's best layouts, but due to the amount of mature trees, it makes it challenging. I bet Pete has not been here in years, otherwise he would be very embarassed to have his name associated with this course."
Maple Creek Golf & Country Club,5808-maple-creek-golf-country-club,Ok course for specially reduced price. It would not be my choice course to play for full price.
Maple Creek Golf & Country Club,5808-maple-creek-golf-country-club,"Bring your ( A ) game!!! putting the ball in the fairway is a must, the rough is thick and juicy!! you will spend time looking for your ball for it will sit down deep. For a short course it is flat and narrow, but it is a test of your ball stikeing ability YOU BETTER HIT IT STRAIGHT!!! Truly a wonderful place to play!!!"
Maple Creek Golf & Country Club,5808-maple-creek-golf-country-club,"I would never pay the asking price for this course. The greens and fairways were in great shape when I played. The course is challenging because the fairways are tight and tree lined along with rough this time of the year that is HEALTHY. The pace of play was probably not the norm (at least I would hope not). We were stuck behind a 7-some! for the first 9 holes before they finally let us play through on #10. Any good course would not allow such a thing. If you can find a time for under $15 and are just looking to hit some balls, it's a good test."
Maple Creek Golf & Country Club,5808-maple-creek-golf-country-club,This course is fun to play and if you want to work on some different strokes this is the course!
Maple Creek Golf & Country Club,5808-maple-creek-golf-country-club,"Despite being rather flat, short, and without much water, this course is visually pleasing and requires some precision in shot selection and execution."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Great course.But pin placements were brutal today.Lipped out on an uphill 3 footer and it came back towards me and rolled all the way off the green. Only complaint would be that I don’t think the greens should be that fast with the slopes they have. But love everything else about it.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Nice challenging course. Greens are tough to putt if you’re in the wrong spot. Will play again. Played the white except in the par 3’s where I played the green tees. That makes total yardage just us see 5800. Just right for seniors, I’m 74. Shot 90, because I 3-putted 5 greens."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,One improvement wood be to redo pave the cart paths. It would really enhance the course a lot.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Unbelievable course for the hot deal price of $21. Regular price at $38ish is fine. Course is in pretty good shape, fun medium length track. Cool signature hole with an old barn on it."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Course was in great shape. Staff is always pleasant and welcoming. Have a wonderful day.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Played here multiple times and in my opinion this course is in fantastic shape. We always have a great time playing here.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,We had a great time. Course is in fantastic condition.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"The course is in magnificent shape. The greens are lush like a carpet but fast, which is tough to pull off. Some courses make their greens fast by cutting them too short, but these must have been built just right. The layout has a lot of different holes, some elevation changes, some doglegs, some short and some long. A few holes are tight, especially from the white tees, but most have enough width to be fair. Most holes are tree-lined, but not too narrow. It was our first time playing here and we lost a couple balls just from unfamiliarity with the course: didn’t know that if the ball ran too far over that hill, it was in the weeds and gone. There aren’t too many blind shots and no forced carries. A number of holes have no sand traps, but then other holes have several. Mostly the greens are not guarded by sand traps, but rather by mounding. There are ponds on the course but they rarely come into play. The holes are not jammed too close together and so other players are not in your consciousness too much. The property is NOT lined by houses, so you never have that feeling that you’re playing in someone’s back yard. I would have to agree that a couple of the greens have a little too much slope for the speed of the greens, so that it is impossible to leave a putt by the hole if you are putting downhill. That was especially true on #9 and #10. On 9 I saw my playing partner tap a putt and it went 15 feet past the hole, so I hit my putt half as hard—and it went 15 feet past the hole! The only other criticism I would have is that the senior tees are too short (5000 yards). On several holes the senior tees were 100 yards in front of the men’s tees. I can’t handle a 400-yard par 4, but I don’t need it to be 280 either. So I played some white tees and some green. I wish that there were a set of tees that came to between 5400 and 5600, or some combo tee set on the card. On a Thursday morning the course was busy, but we still played in 4 hours. The greens fee was reasonable, especially during the week and the senior discount was nice."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"The course was busy and it took 2:30 to play the front nine which is unacceptable. Thankfully, several groups quit after 9 hokes and it took our foursome 1:55 to play the back. We like the layout of most of the course but the greens have a lot of pitch and 15 has so much that is is VERY DIFFICULT to putt or chip and keep it from rolling off the green if you are above the hole. I got lucky and 🐦 it, but if my three footer from above the hole didn't go in it would've rolled off the green....as my playing partner found out! Friendly staff."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,This course is gorgeous and in great shape. Always fun playing here.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Course was in great shape for this time of year. Very senior friendly.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,This course was in the best shape of any one I have played this year. It is a fun and challenging course and we had a blast. This is a must play if you haven’t yet!
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,We had the best of time. I was amazed and pleased that leaves on the ground didn’t play a factor in our round. Kudos to the grounds crew for making sure most of the course was leafless. We always love playing this course.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,This course was in the best shape of any one I have played this year. This is probably my fav course to play. This layout and greens were challenging yet very fun. We had an absolute blast playing this course. Definitely am going to a lot next year.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,The course does tee times in 7 and 8 minute intervals so there are golfers everywhere and a wait on Every Single Shot resulting in a 5 hr round. It’s excruciating!!
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Also…the 14th green is tilted so much from back to front to make it almost impossible to putt. It’s so bad the course workers have a pat answer for complaints…”use the 2-putt rules”.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,The course is in great shape for this time of year and it offers a good challenge with lots of narrow fairways and plenty of trees. The course has some great hils and valleys with some greens sloping more than you realize at first. Always a delight to play!
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Because they got 3"" of rain the night before, it was cart-path-only. Unfortunately the foursome ahead of us consisted of two couples that were fairly new golfers and we were stacked up behind their slow play for the first 13 holes, until they finally let us play through and then they miraculously sped up and pushed us for a few holes before we pulled away."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"They have lots of staff around the clubhouse area, but no Marshal or anyone monitoring play on the course.Otherwise it was an okay round, although I probably won't rush back to play there again this season."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Course was in good shape. They changed some greens to get the slope back into a playable condition. Overbooked tee times. Had to wait on carts and waited at every tee box. It took over 5 hours to play 18.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Fairways in those condition, greens had a lot of slope. If you are not a good putter, could be a long day for you. We were a twosome behind a threesome and for some man it was a long final 13 holes. Would like to have seen arrange her out there to move play along. Other than that Was a good experience, although off the beaten path."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Staff was very helpful and friendly. Course plays well and views are great. Greens are fast.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Great round and love the course, bu the pair of players we were paired with were the slowest pair my brother in law and I have ever played with. 5.5 hours is far too long for an 18 hole round."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,The fairways and greens were in great shape. Pace of play was perfect — 18 in 3 hours. Staff was very friendly and accommodating. I highly recommend playing Winding River.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Nothing about Winding River is going to blow you away, but its a nice value course around Indy. You can still play 18 with a cart for under $50. I liked the layout and its fairly easy to walk. Nice staff. A little off the beaten path."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"This course has to be in the best shape of any course I have played this year. I was very impressed. Even with fall in full swing, you can tell they have kept up on the leaves. We lost only a couple of balls due to leaves. I would definitely recommend this course!!"
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,It took 4 hours and 50 minutes to play 18!! With a pace of play that slow nothing else about the course matters. This place has the tee times set up for every 7 and 8 minutes so it’s on purpose that the pace of play is glacial!! The check in guy at the front desk was rude and abrupt as well. There is no starter either so it’s just a jumble to figure out when it’s your turn. Also…with the tee time set up NO ONE tees off on time. Your going to tee off at least 10 minute late and then take almost 5 hours to play. Who does that? Not me…never again.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,The trees have grown. Yes it has been that long. Greens were in good shape. Pretty cool layout. A couple of the greens are bordering on unfair. The slope of these greens make them virtually unplayable. Good driving range right next to the clubhouse. A fun afternoon with my youngster who played the senior tees.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"1/2 hr behind , no course ranger, stacked up 3-4 deep every hole."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,The course was in great shape. Fairways plush and greens were very smooth and fast. The Barn Hole is beautiful and my favorite hole. Rolling terrain and doesn’t feel like your in the city.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"It was nice to play the Winding River golf course on Saturday. I don't know if it was because of the memorial day holiday or the nice weather, but the course was packed. The staff were very friendly and the course and greens were in great shape. Pace of play was the only challenge all day do to the course being so busy. The course layout is nice with a mixture of tight fairways and a couple of rewarding par 4's."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,I would definitely recommend this course to my golf friends and would play here again.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Great course and met some great guys out here. I will be back to play another round!!
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,There was a rain out on the golf course last week how do I get a refund or a rain check
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Course was in great shape for November. Pace of play at 3:53 was awesome. They had fresh coffee brewed. Always love playing the barn hole.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"It’s took us 3 hours to get through 9, had to leave after 12 because it was another 1.5"
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Winding River is in great shape for this time of the year. Tee boxes, fairways and greens are in great shape. The course played well and the groups were spaced appropriately. Fun day for the money"
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Arrived 50 minutes before the 12:10 tee time. I was told that they were backed up by at least 30 minutes and to expect 18 holes to take 6 hours. Golf now will not refund because it was a hot deal—even though the course could not honor our tee time. Or even come close to it. Finding any customer service for golf now is very difficult but I’ll get to it eventually. If not will kick it to Amex. No service rendered. 1) poor impression of course—I’ll never go back to such a staggering amount of overbooking; 2) I’ll never use golf now again. Period.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Cons11:50 tee time, hit first ball at 12:10Tee backed up due TOCourse letting 2-groups of 5 playThey ended up having whole course backed upInexcusable 4hr and 40 minute roundGreens smooth but need cutFairways, tees okBunkers need work"
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,5 star course. Great condition. Very nice staff. Friendly golfers. Do not change a thing. 99% perfect.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"The day was hot and humid, but the course was in great shape and the challenge is always there. Greens were a bit slow, but it was a Monday. Overall, great value and fun course to play."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,My summer golf around the US has been a great success thus far. This was the third course so far and I have to say it was pretty good!
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Slanted greens. Almost Augusta like. Very pretty park setting. Hilly as well. I'll play it again.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,One of the best courses for the $ around. Don’t be above the hole you can forget about it. Good mixture of tough and easier holes. Drivable Number 11 red barn hole is my favorite. Great for all levels. Cart paths suck.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Decided to play here because course was in great condition 2 months ago. Not so great now after lousy weather in Indiana. Tees and fairways need work. Greens had been recently aerated so putts would not roll well at all. Glad I got it with a hot deal!.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"I've played at Winding River a number of times over the years. This year I've only played there a few times. But this year the course was very dry. Today, the tee boxes were so dry I could hardly get my tee in the ground. The greens were decent, but the fairways were really dry. The pace of play was also very slow today. We had to wait a long time on almost every hole."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Playing this course was good value. It was reasonably priced. But, it felt like a bit of a case of ""you get what you pay for"" - The course conditions were inconsistent and poor at times. Not watered, some patchy greens, very hard and bouncy fairways and greens.Enjoy it for the cost, maybe not the conditions."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Tee times are stacked on top of each other and no martial to ensure a decent pace of play. Groups typically don’t know golf etiquette (or they don’t care). The course is in great condition but you may as well book a course where they care more about your overall experience than how many tee times they can book in a hour. That is unless you don’t mind waiting 10 minutes on every tee to hit your ball.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"They have signs saying wear a mask but don’t make customers wear them in the clubhouse. I asked them about following the guidelines and they said they did not enforce them, cuz it is merely a recommendation. The course was backed up and no starter helped the pace of play. Clearly they over book in order to get their money."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"I typically golf at Winding River once to twice a year. I typically only golf here when I find a hot deal. Fairways and rough are always in great shape. Greens are always is in “ok” shape. Always liked how they take advantage of the hills that they have on the course to make for blind tee shots. Driving range is always very nice and well kept, clubhouse is nice and large with enough food options for when you are making the turn and the pro shop is always clean and organized with someone waiting to service you. The main complaint I have about this course is always the same. Their is always a large backup off the first tee on the weekends. The hole is a nice starting hole, that is always nice and straight and I understand the errant shots that come from all types of golfers to get going for their round. My issue is not that, my issue is that it’s not managed to get people off when it’s their time to go."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,They over booked and a family of 3 kids in front of us took forever and hit multiple balls. Course use to be great
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Liked the course. The tree lined fairways will make you pay if you miss the fairways. That is the most challenging part of the course. Keep it in the fairway and you should score well.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"I love this course. It is challenging. If you are semi serious about your golf game, then you will enjoy this course. Friendly staff. Very good course condition as usual. Yes, there is great demand for this course."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"I love this course. Challenging but not overwhelming. Condition is always excellent. Great staff. The previous time, the grass cutting guy gave us a dozen quality golf balls he had found. If you are a serious hacker disguised as a golfer, you will enjoy this course. There is a great demand for this course."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,We had a 10:42 tee time. We arrived 20 minutes ahead and the line up at the first tee was huge. We didn’t tee off until 11:20. Course is interesting and doesn’t get boring. Plenty of long challenging holes playing for the whites. Pace of play was ridiculous. Took nearly 5.5 hours to play the round. There is no place to get drinks or snacks at the turn so by the time we finished all 4 of us were quite thirsty. While the course is ok I wouldn’t recommend this course on a weekend as the scheduling of tee times is obviously too tight and the pace of play far too slow.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Great course for the money, greens and fairways in good shape."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Found on golf now for $19 with cart. Back nine has a lot of really cool views and fun tee shots into greens with good opportunities to score. First time playing the course and shot a 76 from the whites.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Overall course in good condition but the greens are too slow. Maybe 6 on the stimp.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"This course surprised me. It was priced really good and was in excellent condition. The greens were a little long and slow, but all in great shape. Will go back soon."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,The day went very well from check in to finish. We were a twosome and 2 foursomes let us play through which was greatly appreciated and help keep our round moving. The course was in great shape
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Course was in great shape. Greens were really nice and really sloped. Had a great day playing golf with my son.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Fun course with challenging, sloping greens, and gently rolling hills. Quite busy because course just opened, but conditions were great."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"I've played this course often over the years. I like the course. It was in great shape, people are friendly, price using GolfNow is good."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"ProsTees and fairwaysBunkers way above average for most partGreens no bare spotsConsGreens rough putting very bumpySome thin grass in some fairways, but will improveFairways mostly dryWill look forward to play later this year"
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,This was the first time out at Winding River this Spring. The greens are getting fast fairways were good shape and Tee boxes were great.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"The course for being in the middle of winter was amazing. It was green and and freshly cut. The fairways , tee boxes and greens were well defined and maintained."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Well taken care of course. It's fairly easy. No water hazards, few bunkers, fairways are mostly open and not too crowded with trees. Fairways and greens in very good condition."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Good place to golf. Fairway in good shape. No restrooms on course so not very woman friendly. Overall not bad
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Course was well taken care of, tee boxes, fairways, and greens were all very nice. Landscaping and hills were very fun to play around and made for a fun but challenging day. Not much of a winding river but a great course none the less. One of my favorites on the south side of Indy"
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Amazing Course. Beautiful fairways, well kept greens. Perfect amount of challenge for the average golfer."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Rates are perfect!
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Loved playing here and will be back
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,I love playing WR! The pace of play was slow due to double booking by Golfnow but it was such a beautiful day I didn't mind the 5 hour round!
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Enjoyed playing at winding River today the course was in immaculate shape greens and fairways and tees were beautiful I would highly recommended this course to my friends and fellow golfers. You can tell they work hard to keep this course inShape
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,My brother and I have used golf now for years and this is by far the worst experience. With Golf Now. We showed up for our tee time and the first thing that happened was the first tee was backed up by 5 or 6 groups. They also had to take a cart away from other people to get people out. We finally just gave up and left the course knowing our round would take 6 hours with waiting time. This experience has made me leery of booking a hot deal in the future.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Showed up for an 11 o’clock tee time. Wait to tee off was well over 45 minutes. One poor guy trying to keep track of everything couldn’t handle it. There were no carts. Round looked like it would be 5 to 6 hours. We left even after paying for a hot deal. I don’t understand why a hot deal was offered for an overbooked course. They were totally under staffed and unprepared for such a busy day.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"I've played this course since I was a teenager. Being 26, it still provides a challenge which is awesome!"
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Haven't played here in years. Great grass, tough greens. Practice your approach and putting cuz its gonna matter. Beautiful course with some weird layouts occasionally but definitely worth a trip if you're in Indianapolis. I'll be back this summer for sure. Great course for you if you like your driver."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Pretty Rolling Hills Course For a flat state lined with beautiful huge trees.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Great Vakue
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,This course is enjoyable to play and is in great shape. I was pleasantly surprised with the green quality and the tee to green lushness. There are 2 holes that play a little quirky but dont really detract from the overall appeal. I find the back 9 to be a much more enjoyable layout. For the price this is a great option. Well worth the money.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"I schedule a 8:50am tee time as a single. I get to the course and there is an outing getting ready to start, 17 teams of 4. Now normally when a place books an outing they close it down to the public for a certain amount of time, not these money hungry people. Then to top it off I get forced to join a group of 3 that spoke very little english and we couldn't communicate. It was the worst round of gold I have ever played, almost 3 hours to finish 9 holes. I didnt even bother with the other 9. Would not recommend this course to anyone."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Winding River is a fun course to play. Challe ging enough but enough short holes to try and post a low score. I have played this course for years and have always enjoyed it. Pace of play depends on time of day. Avg round in peak time is 4.5 hrs. But off hours easy 3.5. Greens are fast in summer, and leaves are heavy in the fall. Bring bug spray cause it is near water and mosquitoes can be an issue. Overall enjoyable course, I only wish they would hold and amatuer stroke play event. That would he cool."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,the course was average in every area...but..it was still fun playing...no serious complaints but not one of the better courses in indy
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"This course definitely has potential, but is in desperate need for some upgrades. Traps are like concrete, and cart paths are almost gravel. Definitely a $25 course."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"First time playing this course, it is a 55 min drive for us. We were not thrilled that we drove so far to play this course.Its a good community course, so if you live in the area will be good to play on a weekday evening or some low key weekend. The course has bunkers but they are mostly not it play or even maintained very well as they probably don't see much action. No water in play either just straight up holes layed next to each other except 1 hole. Greens are well maintained, grass overall is well maintained."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,The course was in good condition specifically the greens. The fairways and parts of the rough could you some water. The staff is friendly and the golf carts are in great condition. The cart paths on the course are in disrepair. I played during a outing and its slow the pace significantly. Definitely worth the money.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Everything was ok not spectacular but better than average greens were quick and holding pace of play was ok
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Loved the rolling hills and elevations of this course. Many of the courses in town are flat and narrow, but this had plenty trees, doglegs, and hidden fairway areas to make it fun. Will definitely play here again."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Found a real good rate on Golfnow. When we got there we figured the rate was good because we were going out behind the women’s league (sorry girls, no I’ll intent meant). However, the women didn’t slow us up one bit. They stayed up with the group in front of them and we tried to stay with them."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"This course is such a quality course for only $30 for 18 holes w/ a cart. The course is well taken care of, it is always near capacity, yet the pace of play isn't bad. After golfing around other nearby courses, I think I've found my ""home"" course where I'll golf most of my rounds. Keep it up, Winding River."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Golf course is a great place to play had a good game also the course is in great shape will be back to play again
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Based on paying $30.00 to ride 18 holes, I would definitely recommend this course. The layout is well-planned with several holes that give you a chance to be aggressive at a risk or lay it up for the one-putt par. Greens were well maintained and relatively challenging, but fair."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Tee boxes could use some work in places, and some of the bunkers could use more and better sand. However, my biggest complaint (and the reason it doesn't get five stars, is the crazy amount of mosquitos on the front side (near the ponds). They really need to treat this water and/or put in some swallow bird houses. There were about four holes that we were literally just going up and hitting our ball quickly because of this."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Otherwise, great course and I would expect to be returning with my buddy again."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Well maintained course with very friendly, helpful staff. Greens are challenging!"
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Course layout is fun. Greens having been recently punched were in fantastic shape. Not a long course but without a flat green to be seen, it is challenging. I would and will play again."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Biggest issue I have is with green complexes and tee boxes. First the greens. Most of the greens are built into side of hills that have zero flat spots, keeping the ball below the hole is paramount. If you leave above the hole stopping your putt or chip is practically impossible, hole 2, 9 and 14 are great examples of this. You must know where to miss. Tee boxes, all par 3 tee boxes where indistinguishable from my own lawn which I mow at 3 inches, ok I did exaggerate but hitting flyers was the norm on par 3’s. Fairways where manageable as was the rough. Hope so his helps the next group."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"The course was in good condition, even after some rain. The pace of play was very slow as there were some groups playing extremely slow. Overall it was a good golf day just slow going"
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Can’t think of a single complaint. The greens are in good condition and provide a fun but challenging putting experience. The hilly landscape of the course provides many opportunities for scenic views that we often found ourselves pausing to take in. The pictures on here do not do the course justice in my opinion. I’m on a journey to play all of the courses in Indy, and this course is one I’m looking forward to coming back to."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Winding River Golf Course is a great course and lay out, besides a couple of not so great fairways and bunkers the course was in great condition and the greens rolled true. However, as we made the turn And got to the 12th tee we were waiting on the group in front of us when we heard a loud whistle and we didn’t pay any attention to it. Then we heard it again and we turned around and two golfers were finishing up on 11 green and were whistling at us and motioning to speed up play. Well, we couldn’t because the group in front of us and then the two drove up to us and it turned out that both of them worked at the course. All three of us in the group found it very unprofessional that the staff whistled at us. Then he told us there was a “tournament” right behind us and we needed to hurry up, but we were playing pace of play and couldn’t help that the group in front was taking slightly longer than usually to find their balls. That was a lot to type, but we just thought it was very rude to pushed by two staff at the course when they can play any other time I’m sure."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"horrible scheduling. 15 foursomes teeing off between 11am and 12pm. Course looked nice, but wasn’t willing to tee off 45 minutes late and play a 6 hour round..."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Good layout. Not spectacular. Ground very hard. Needs some maintenance. Greens were OK.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"We play here once a month or so and was a nice round as expected.Everything had been mowed and maintained. It was a warm day and dry conditions. For being late spring, the weeds are mostly under control.Only saw a rough patch or two in a couple fairways. The fairways were not cut super short, but easily differentiated from the rough and good.Most of the greens are in great shape. Only a couple greens had excessive ball marks, and one or two had some spots that needed love. The grass is seeding, so grain direction was important. Balls rolled pretty quick. Most greens have a pretty good slope to them and break heavy.Tee boxes were in great shape and maintained, other than broken tees needing picked up and stepping on a few in the ground.I like playing here. Layout is challenging and the trees can get you if hit into them. We usually go for the Golfnow Hot Deal and the price is right!Get to see some various wildlife at times as the woods and river sets to the east and south of the entire course. A few scenic and pretty hole layouts."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Enjoy this course very muchOther golfers you like to play a nice course the greens are wonderful the fairways are wonderful and the second cat is wonderful enjoy the place I do
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Our tee time was set directly behind a shotgun start scramble. I guess they made their money on our hot deal...after 3.5 hour front nine we had to call it.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Could have sent us off the back. Not an option from the guy at the counter who had no time for me. Didn’t even have a cart for us. See my previous review. Why did I go out there again?
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,It’s just not worth it - terrible customer service.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Winding RIver has a classic design with smallish tilted greens. I liked the layout as it had some character and required some different shots, especially in the heavy wind we played in. I was a bit surprised how hole 15's fairway was exposed to the driving range, so we had to dodge a few while there. Main gripe about the layout: hi-tension power lines ran through some holes, and were even in the fairway on 6."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Main tip: Don't go above the hole. The conditions were very firm. Had to bounce it onto the green, even with a wedge in your hand or it was going off the back. Greens were pretty quick. The rough and fairways show the scars of the rough winter. Rough especially was patchy at times."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Overall, for the price it was ok. Don't go in with high expectations and you can enjoy yourself. Just don't go above the hole."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,The last four holes are absolutely gorgeous. The course gets better as you play it. Need to do a better job with grass clippings in the fairway. The staff could not have been nicer. Will definitely get back.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,We really enjoyed the course!!!Staff was excellent
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Played on a Sunday evening. Course was great. Pace of play was a little slower than I would like. I must say that I play relatively fast
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Excellent laid out course. Challenging for experienced players, while maintaining wide open fairways for beginners needing extra room to navigate. Staff keeps golf course well kempt. Nearly all greens have undulations."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,I went out around 7AM on a Saturday and the course was pretty empty except for me and a million mosquitoes. As the sun came up they all disappeared but the first few holes were rough. The staff was very friendly and the course was in great shape. By the end of the round the weather was beautiful and the course was full of people.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"course was in good condition, I didn't play very good,my fault not the course. would recommend to friends"
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Was a beautiful day. But, somehow the course was surprised by the number of golfers? No cart for 10 minutes after our tee time.Just to top it off - no hot dogs at the turn. probably my last trip out there for awhile. If I had paid full price I would have been disappointed."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,First time out this year. Course was in good shape especially greens. Senior tee boxes a bit worn. Slope and pin location #14 made putting impossible.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"The Director of Instruction stopped to help me at the snack bar. Course and staff were great. I even got to check out the teaching facility, it was amazing. I came back for a lesson and shot my best score next time out. Instructor is amazing, love the course and practice facility is worth going out of my way. Thank you."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Tried to use the directions from golf now but it brought me like 6 miles from the course. It directed me north of I-465 but the course is actually south of there!!!! Once I found the course it was ok!!! The club house is not very good conditions and they really don't have a lot to offer
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Just seems to click for me. Great layout that's just challenging enough with out being stupid. Love it.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,I have played this course a few times this year and for the money you can't find a better course to play
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"I played this course yesterday and I really enjoyed it! The course was generally well maintained and I got a really good price through Golfnow.com. The only issue that we had was that since it is November, there were leaves everywhere and I lost quite a few balls because I got tired of digging through leaves to find them. That being said, this course is definitely a ton of fun and I definitely will be back!"
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Needed mowing. Greens were decent. Long grass made more of a challenge. Good course overall.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"The course was in good condition other than the greens were a little burned. Pace of play was fairly slow, averaged about 2 hrs 15 mins per 9 holes."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"I use to play here a lot, i quite going there because of the condition of the fairway and greens three years ago, then on 6/30/16 i found a hot deal here on golfnow so I decided to give them a try. Wow, has that course changed for even worse from three years ago? the deal was $16.00 for 18 holes, Please Please do yourself a favor and save the time even if the course pays you $16.00 to play there. I don't think they know what weedkiller means, they even have weeds growing on part of the greens."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Horrible course.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Usually you get what you pay for, but in this case, you won't get what you play for if they paid you to play."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Have played WR many times. Decent layout but as the weather warms up tees, fairways and greens become rough (you shouldn't hit your tee ball in the middle of the fairway & not be on grass). Not an upscale course but could do a much better job of managing players and play. Recently played behind 3 teens using 1 cart and playing out of 2 bags (should not be allowed). Have made early morning tee times to play quickly only to make the turn and find they sent players off the back 9. Flew around the front and waited every hole on the back (should not happen). Some of the greens have a ridiculous amount of slope. Could be a good course with better care and management. Good value, pretty layout but be prepared for anything."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Play the course several times a year and will continue to play it. Always a fun place to play
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Played mid-morning. The course has bluegrass tees and fairways. Half or more of the tees were overgrown with clover and crabgrass. Fairways and greens were fine. Layout is solid with one exceptionally questionably design, hole 6. Sand traps have many large stones. We were killed by pace of play which was around 4:50. May be other courses of better value. If you can land a deal and play early, may be worth it."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Beautiful course that is well maintained, including the sand traps."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,It's pretty wide open. A couple long par 3's and 1 really short one. The front nine was average the back nine had character. It's a very well kept course.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,I've played a ton of golf all over the USA....in my opinion the entire staff at Winding River is the cream of the crop.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"The course is great offering challenging greens, several risk/reward shots and excellent conditions for a muni......it's a must play!"
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Blowing leaves and wet greens in the morning.Beautiful day, good rounds.Forgot how sloped the greens were. And they holes were cut on ridge edges."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"My first time playing this course. My son played here in high school, so I was familiar with the course, but had never played it. The course was in great shape. They had not yet plugged the greens, so I had the full enjoyment of very fast greens which rolled true.I will be back."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"The course was fairly challenging but also somewhat forgiving. The fairways and greens were well maintained. The tee boxes were a little long, but you could tell some had been recently reseeded. We played it on a Tuesday morning and although it appeared as we were pilling up on some tee boxes, we managed to play it just under 4 hours. Our bucket list to golf all 50 just added some great memories at Winding River. For the price and location, i would play it again."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"I was bumped from my tee time so ""members"" could play. Then the staff was rude and acted like it was my fault somehow. Never going back."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Only had time for 9-holes on a Sunday morning and they allowed us to tee off on the back nine. Back nine has a great layout of varying length and hazards. Pace of play was right at 2 hours. Would play all the full 18. Good driving range.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Bad weather, quit after 13 holes. Course in very good condition. Lots of rain past week but still able to use cart. Well drained. Had to get a blood transfusion after playing due to mosquitos -- never seen them so bad!!"
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Good conditions for the early spring. Greens were slow.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"I always love winding river. It was a weird day weather wise so not a whole lot of people on the course. Greens are being aerated so greens were a little funky, course overall was in very good shape for being November.."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"I played WR on a mild 55 degree day the coarse was in great shape. I could see White River through the trees on hole 5 (PAR 5) in the back since the leaves had fallen, had a great round and a lot of fun. Nice coarse for the money; I'll play WR again next year."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"I always enjoy Winding River and for this time of year the course and weather were good. My only problem was with there being no ranger out, some people were not courteous. We were a twosome and had to wait every hole on a foursome who had no one in front of them. Thankfully at the turn we went ahead as they got something to drink."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Greens were prepped for winter and heavily aerated and sanded. made for rough putting, but rest of course was excellent."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"I had to come back to pay this course again because it beat me down last time that I was here. The darn greens are so difficult! A few holes into my round, the temperature dropped and the wind howled the rest of the time. I had a great time and will certainly return again."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"good course for the money, all ages can play and enjoy themselves. I have played out there 12 plus times this year. never get tired of playing"
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,I played 18 holes and this course offers quite the variety. Greens were super fast and a tough read for me.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Not exactly easy to find. Nice country course with fairly wide fairways, and heavy rough in spots. Not very long, but very small greens. In addition, many of the greens have pretty severe slopes, so you have to be putting uphill or - watch out. Pretty hilly for central Indiana - a lot of up and down the same set of hills. The day we played the greens were very fast, so along with the slope, it made 2 putting a challenge. I will play it again. No GPS on the carts so bring your own."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Mu husband, daughter, and I really enjoyed playing this course. If was a beautiful course. The people in the proshop were fantastic. One of the carts started to run out of juice on the 7th hole, so we just called the proshop and they immediately came out with a new cart. We wish the course was closer to our home, but we will make the the drive out there again!"
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"I had never played this course. The staff directed me very vaguely to a cart. They gave me the key but all ""ready carts"" already had keys in them. The only one without a key is the one I picked which was in the general direction of where I was pointed but seemed to be one that needed to be turned in. Nevertheless, This was my cart. I noticed by the end of the first hole that this thing was out of juice. I essentially had to try and push the thing around. Not fun at all. Yes, I would have returned to the clubhouse but thought maybe it would be ok. It was really bad, had to try and find ways to get it to where it needed to be."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"I felt like I was always under the gun trying to contend with this low-battery power cart. I ended up losing my lob wedge. Now, that is not the cart's fault or even the course but it added to my frustration as I felt like I needed to make up time due to the cart."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,The course is nice with 3 tees very elevated from the Fairway which is pretty cool. Hardly any water or sand but it is fairly long at some 6300 yards from the whites. Many people don't fix their ball marks ion the greens but that is not a reflection of the course.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,The cart paths are pretty busted up and the direction can be vague. I might try it again but was overall not real impressed.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Had a good time buddy up with a grope that made it fun
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,During the spring this course was the best that I played but during the sumer they must get so much play that the course conditions have declined somewhat. Some greens have rough spots. Fairways are in good shape. This is still a great course for seniors and the placing of the senior tees give a chance for a reasonable score.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Best course for the money yhat I have played in Indy.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Tee areas need lot of care. Greens very slow & lots of pitch marks. Fairways nice. Lunch was terrible, threw it away."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Good course for the money!!Golf now , $32.00 for two.Course has a lot of character and in good shape.The back nine will keep you honest.Marc"
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"we paid $20 on the hot deal price, for that price it was a great value! front 9 a few greens were not great, but the back 9 they were great. Brother got a hole in one on 17, made the day even better!!"
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,I been playing and this one to me don't have a lot of bunkers like it should and no ponds to hit over like most so it's a easy Crouse to play on just a lot a trees and that's a plus.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Course was in good playing condition except the rough was long and had some clumped grass from waiting to long to cut. Greens were soft and very receptive yet rolled at a good pace. These conditions can be attributed to the fact that they have had a lot of rain the last couple weeks. Staff was very friendly and we had a enjoyable round of golf.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Maintenance had allowed the rough to overgrow resulting in a lot of clumped grass in the rough. Placed me in the middle of a morning league outing that prevented any fluid movement on the course. Greens well maintained and only concern was allowing the rough to get too heavy before mowing and leaving way too much excess grass off of the fairways.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Nic and would play the course again.e local public course with moderate challenges. Weather was good, greens could be rolled, some rough was higher than normal but overall course played well. Staff was very good"
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"got it as a hot deal, course is fun to play and has some challenges for intermediate golfers. for late April course is in great shape, greens solid speed. Love the course and will most definitely play again"
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,For this time of year--with the rough winter and recent rain and wind---the course was in good shape with barely any debris on greens.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Very open and forgiving course. Still early (March) in the year but was in pretty good shape. Greens were fast. I shot an 84 which is low for me, normally shoot high 80's low 90's. No starter, just got in line but still started at designated time. Very busy that day, I would go back."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"My friend and I rode 18 on a Sunday. Pace was steady, but not crowded. No water, a few sand traps, and a good amount of trees along the fairways. A couple of the greens were chewed up as well as some of the tee boxes. Otherwise, the course was in pretty good shape for a city course. One of the relatively newer and nicer city courses in Indy. Nice scenery, a lot of rolling hills. Good value overall."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"The course was fun to play. Tee boxes were being aerated which made it a little muddy, but overall experience was good. I will be coming back."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"The fairways were well maintained, the rough could have been a little lower cut, greens& tees were average, and bunkers were in reasonable condition. It is well worth the money, challenging, and a fun place to play."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Management does not conduct themselves in a professional manner. Course had weeds and looks as if it has been neglected. This will be the last time I will hold at Winding River.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Slow play was due to a group of four allowed 3 carts and still played slow. The greens had a lot of bare sports full of sand making putting hard. The rough had a lot of dead grass clumps making it difficult to find a ball.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Showed up as a single to play 18 ; was paired up with 3 guys who made it clear they didn't want an outsider to play with. Two of the three weren't following the ""collared shirt"" rule. Two other guys did volunteer to let me play along with them; failed to tell me they were only playing 9. They left, and this would put me behind my earlier ""pals"" who dissed me. Left with a bad taste in my mouth."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Course is in nice shape. The greens are in good condition, not great condition, good condition. Very nice staff. Good overall experience. Some money needs to be spent to maintain the old golf carts."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"A beautiful rolling course with a lot of old growth trees and flowing fairways which are extremely well kept. Traps were very playable but the greens are just intolerably slow. The keepers are currently dressing and aerating the greens so they should play much better in the near future. The course management is aware of the problem and told us what to expect before we paid to play which is always an appreciated gesture. It is an absolutely beautiful course to enjoy. We'll play the course again I hope. I wouldn't want to walk it, but riding it is enjoyable even though the cart paths could use some work. But hey it's Indiana and this golf course is a great place to play if you like older style courses with mature trees. I recommend it to anyone that is looking for an enjoyable golfing experience."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Pace of play was consistently paced even though the course was busy. Greens were in good shape and fairways were in best shape I have seen at this course.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"The course was in great shape. The greens were well maintained and challenging. The grass off off the fairways was cut low, so that shots were not difficult to hit. This is a well laid out course that incorporates the lay of the land with several challenging holes. A good drive rewards you with a second shot that is free from worrying about trees on most holes."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"the course was in excellent shape, the greens were in the best shape of any golf course i have played this year"
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"Overall the course was in decent shape. Good Hot Deal on GNow made it acceptable. But I can only rate it a 1 of 5 stars. Where Winding River GC loses its appeal is in its poor design layout and set up. This was my first time playing, so it would be better a 2nd time, however that will not be happening as it was almost impossible to know where to go or where the next hole was, the cart paths had no markings and led you away from the next hole at times. Several times the path would cross right in front of the next tee box (Someone could get killed!!) and several other holes had blind tee or approach shots. On courses where alot of HH or beginners play, having these type of holes and possible situations only leads to SLOW PLAY and is NOT SAFE! Better deals are available on GNow....look elsewhere."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Old Gentleman at front desk was super friendly and extremely helpful!
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,This is one of the true courses in the city area that has great elevation changes. The value you get when buying online via golfnow is great. I played today with two people from Muncie and they loved the course as well.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,I think they have there priorities mixed up. The course needed mowing and they had 2 people mowing and 3 people cutting up a tree that was no where close to being in play. The course was covered in grass clumps that needed to be knocked down. All they had to do was drag a chain between 2 carts or drag a piece of chain link fence attached to a 2x4 behind a golf cart to knock down the clumps. It just seems like whoever is in charge of the grounds crew needs to start taking there job seriously. I will not go back these year at any price.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Course was in great shape. First time I played it - will definitely go back. Great views with some rolling hills and nice changes in elevation. Nice size greens - average speed.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,course in great shape. Course played fast with no waiting.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Great crs greens are for pros great place to work on putting the correct way.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"It's obvious the owners have put a lot of time, effort, and money into the golf course...a great place to play!"
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"This was one of the few courses open on Jan 11. The guy there was super helpful and friendly, he seemed really glad that we came to play. For the weather the course was in great shape and was a fun course to play, well laid out and varied. greens were in great shape."
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,Well maintained but tricky course. Lots of uphill and downhill shots. Strategically placed trees to mess with your mind. Beautiful views when on the upper holes. Lots of fun.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,We enjoyed playing this well maintained course yesterday.
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,i liked the course itself. the problem i had was that it was very slow and there were no rangers out to help the pace. On the 18th hole there were 4groups on the course one on the green 2 in the fairway and us on the tee. they needed a ranger out there to help the pace of play. so it was a good course but you need all day to play it!
Winding River Golf Club,553-winding-river-golf-club,"The course offered a challenge with a mix of holes...long, short, tight, and open. Some of the greens were inconsistent which made it a little tough to putt. One green is deadly! My buddy had his putt stop right at the hole, pause, and then trickled and rolled 45 feet to finish off the front of the green. Wicked. I really enjoyed some of the holes along the woods and out around the barn. The pace of play was a little slow but can't complain too much for it being a Saturday afternoon. For the right price, it's an average course and worth playing once."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Smock is a great course, but it was horribly oversold. I started at 1:30 PM and gave up on trying to finish with 2 holes remaining. You can't stack 6 or 7 consecutive foursomes on a Fall afternoon and expect anyone to finish in under 5 hours. I'll definitely think twice before coming back."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Everything is great at this course and staff friendly. Challenging but nice
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Course needs to manage the pace of play better. Luckily few groups were nice to let play thru but seems like “members” can play at a slow pace. Played smock for years and it’s always a problem. Seems staff is more interested in making a dollar than keeping pace of play.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Course was in excellent condition. Good variety of holes. Four sets of tees allow for a fun round of golf for all players
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Great course! Many sneaky hard holes that will challenge on
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Always reliable Smock, a solid Parkland, track design and condition. Especially the greens. Good value for the money"
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Greens were as hard as a rock. Nothing stuck, everything rolled off the back even if I hit the front of the green. Tee boxes also very hard. Fairways were not bad. Could use some TLC on most of the greens at this course. Pace of play was solid. Was playing with 2 others and we finished in 4 hours"
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,This course is over 6400yds from the white tees. For us mortal golfers that is a long course! It’s a good layout in good condition it’s just long. The par 4s are between 370 and 420 and 2 of the par 3s are 190+. Have the short game tidy if you want to score!
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Course in very good shape. Fairways nice and greens were fast but true. A good challenging Indy course for the price. Lots of players but to be expected for a good local course. Friendly staff.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Perfect day for golf. Course was in excellent condition from tee to green!
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Course conditions were really good despite lack of rain. Greens were moderately fast but consistent through the round. Well maintained fairways and tee boxes great course on Indy south side
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Love how open the course is. Great for beginning golfers.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,This course has a great layout and was in perfect shape. They did not over book the course and our foursome was able to complete 18 in four hours.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"It was warm but a great afternoon/eve of golf. Some of the fairways are very close to each other, but it also has some beautiful topography."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"This course is just not fun to play. Its nice enough, taken care of well enough. The staff is OK. Facilities are OK. It just NOT FUN to play! The course is 6400yards from the WHITE tees! Its only 6800 from the blues!! Every par 4 plays in the 380+ range, 2 of the par 3s are 200+ yards and there are ponds and a stream that runs through the course. If the course played shorter...say 6,000 yards..it would be OK. You don't have that option though. Its either 6400 or 5000. Its too long...or too short...hence...its NO FUN to play!"
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Course was in excellent shape. Fairways and roughs recently mowed. Greens were rolling fast. Pace a little slow on the front 9 and didn't notice any ranger around. The slow group was maybe two groups in front of us. We didn't stop at the turn and apparently got in front of them. Pace on the back 9 was great.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,I don’t know who is writing reviews here about staff friendliness but I will tell you that’s not the case today. No use allowed of a driving range and no help whatsoever. I was hoping this would be a good experience since I live close by but obviously has been a waste of my time
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Although it is busy most days they keep everyone moving and the round going. Very friendly staff and affordable price! Course is challenging with change in elevation and creeks that make you work your way around the course!
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Rough was a little long, but it was spring so understandable. The tee boxes were rough lots of bare spots so early in the season"
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,This course is VERY long and takes forever to play. Two good reasons to play somewhere else.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Windy and wet. Pace of play slow due to cart path only. Greens in excellent condition. White/gold tee box markers were missing. So, either play whites at 6438 or golds at 5363. For my game, the white/gold at 5978 is just right. Played the whites. a few too many bogies. Otherwise, a good time out."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Nice course overall. When we played it was very very saturated, when its that bad and cart path only not worth $40+ during those times."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Super nice staff, good value, and good challenge for golfers of all levels"
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Greens were still recovering from seasonal aeration
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Little wet, no hard rain,no hard windStaff very professionalPlayed gold tee box’s,good shapeFairways good shapeMost bunkers I looked at,had sand and rakesGreens pretty quick, have some aeration holesBUT minimal size holes.Not a lot of leave issues on greensOverall pretty good shape for 10/31"
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"A written review not just star’sWish others took the timeAlmost,a all good reviewOlder Gentlemen at pro shop counter exceptionalGreens as close to a 10 as a muni can beSmooth and same cut ,a little firmFairways a fair 7Tees a little highBunkers , well you know it’s a muniOverall condition,very goodNo ranger, seen for help,3 groups in front of us very slowFrom our group back, waited on every shot after 3rd holeShould have been 4hrs turned into 5+😡"
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Solid test of golf for all levels.If you can hit 250+ jump on the blue tees and play close to 6700 yards. The real challenge is to play the ball down. There are subtle hills and hidden hazards forcing good decision making. Bunkers are well placed but many have been converted to seed grass, I assume to cut back maintenance cost.I played with Terry Schill who has for years been the best iron player in the state of Indiana. He hit 17 of 18 greens but only made three birdies which reflected the difficulty of the greens. Mr. Schill said there were small breaks not easily read.Overall please go play here and not worry if you forgot anything because the pro shop is very well stocked. Great parking and east to navigate. Whatever you do play the correct tees. The white tees are too hard for the average golfer.Fair warning."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Course was in great shape. They always do a great job on maintaining the course condition. Staff is super friendly. Unfortunately, we got rained out after 6. Had no delays or issues during those 6 holes. Pace was fine, no waiting. Nice course for the money."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Course is in very good condition. Greens are decently fast. Pace of play was okay, but we had an early tee time. Unfortunately we were rained on and got only 6 holes in. No problem getting a rain check credit for the remaining 12. Eager to go back. Fun course."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,I had seen this course on GN but wondered if it was worth the 40 minute drive from where I live. Totally surprised at how nice this public course is! I am going back for sure. Very well worth the modest green fee to play!
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Greens were so fast I couldn’t stay on for anything.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,There are weeds in all fairway bunkers. Last few holes too tight. Would not play without hard hat! Out group got hit once and just narrowly missed 3 others times including one ball on 18th tee box that missed me by a foot on the fly. Not one person ever yelled four or apologized!
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Beautifully layed out. Well taken care of. Fast greens. Would only play here during the week. Overcrowded on the weekends. Should not take five and a half hours to play 18. Hit and wait gets old after the first few holes.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"It was a great course, beautiful weather and an awesome staff"
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Course was in good condition. Nice challenging course but fun to play.will come back for sure
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Played the course for the first time today with my son and it was in excellent shape. The course is fairly open with some nice rolling hills that allows for you to make some mistakes but gives you some opportunities to recover. It was a great experience at the course, I caked ahead and was Anne to move our tee time up twenty minutes and the pro shop was grassy to work with, so we were ahead of most the groups and finished our round in 3 hrs 48 minutes. I would love to play the course again in the future and suggest to course to all levels of skills."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Course was in really nice shape. Lush fairways and rough. Greens slower but true. Overall the course was in good condition.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Downside is play was slow. Did not see a ranger who could have speeded things up. Our round took over 5 1/2 hours. I didn’t need to be anywhere after the round, but if I did, it would have been frustrating."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,This course is maintained very well and definitely worth the money.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"I enjoyed playing but the course was busy with too many singles and doubles. I can see why they have no friends, though. Impatient people should not play golf. Our foursome played well within a 4-hour pace and were there to also enjoy each other's company. It is very inconsiderate to push when the course is already full. They need some friends or there should be a course policy to create foursomes on a busy day. I probably wont be back although I really liked the course."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"This course is beautiful. I have been playing it for years. Always very well-kept, greens toll true, fairways in perfect condition. The staff, however, are awful. They are almost all rude, dismissive and act as if they are doing you a favor by coming to work today. This has been my experience on almost every occasion. But, I look past it because the course is truly well kept. Do better and you have one heck of an experience. Keep up the attitude, and you will forever turn people away. Shape up or go work somewhere else."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Just like almost every other course August in Indiana is very dry. So try to stay in the middle of fairway
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,I wish GolfNow wouldn’t allow tee times when the course is packed. Only played 6 holes—Pace of play was the worst I’ve ever seen. No refund or rain check for even 9 holes.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Love the people here. The course is forgiving on most holes, it’s in great condition, and the price is unbeatable!"
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Few bad spots but to be.exspected . Greens are nice !!"" FIX YOUR DIVOTS AMERICA "". PLUS ONE,"
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"After my discount card, that I should be able to use over and over for a year, was punched so that I can not use it again and nothing being done to fix the problem I had a bad taste in my mouth for this course. Game play for a Monday was extremely slow. They were overbooked and did not fix that. Due to time restraints (we had plenty of time to get play in based on the length of time it should have taken) we were not even able to start our back nine. We requested a refund but were told we could have a rain check. I also asked about my discount card and was at first told we it could be fixed. Then when I asked again the response was, “since you are not returning it doesn’t matter.” I have never been treated so rudely at a golf course. I have played for over 30 years and many different courses.Please do not go here."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Great round.... pace was slow but all in all superb experience!
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,If you have 4 1/2 to 5 hours to kill go for it. Waited 7-10 minutes on every hole. Group in from had no one in front but would not let our twosome through. Then al we got caught at the turn behind other groups starting on the back 9.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Second shot first hole marshal meets us with a. This is your one warning for keeping your cart on the cart path! Seriously unnecessary we hardly hit grass and don’t need that kind of treatment.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"For a mid-March round, the course was in great condition. Beautiful course, and long. 4.5 hours as a 2-some, so keep that in mind. 6400 yards from the white tees. Great time."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,The course looks like it will be easy and not worth it. But it is actually a challenging course. There are some holes were i got confused on which pin was for my whole. Overall really nice course and a very warm and welcoming staff
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Took my brother in law out for a round this afternoon. Staff were very nice when checking in. Pace of play was a little slow on the front due to a group messing around but we still finished 18 at about 4.5 hrs. Some of the greens were beat up due to people not fixing their pitch marks. It was overall a good round and will definitely be back.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,The guy at the counter was a complete a hole. We left without playing
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Decent affordable course. Overbooked and painfully slow.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Never had a bad day golfing at Smock. Got paired with two gentlemen and had a great time.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"It was a little wet, but putting that aside the course was in very good condition. Greens rolled smooth and fairways looked very clean."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Great course they stay on top and green up keep is great... Highly recommend this to any golfer no matter level of play .... Staff is always polite and keep thongs going !!!
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Put a restroom break out there somewhere. That was brutal.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Course is always in great shape with a great layout
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Greens rolled very true. No waiting on any hole. Great day.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"This course is in good condition, considering the time of year. Appeared to be recently aerated, but not a problem. Course can play long, especially in high winds, but fairway are wide and forgiving for the most part. This course is fun to play."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"The only real problem with smock is that it’s easy to get to. So when the weather is nice, it fills up fast. Pace of play was crazy slow from everyone and these practice swings. Get your yardage grab a club and take a shot. After your round go to work. If you were playing good golf, I wouldn’t see you hovering over your ball so long. They are doing aeration for the season I think. Like most courses will. But things looked really good out there"
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Love this course and the staff has always been very friendly and enjoyed having us.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"As far as value for money goes, this is the best course I’ve played around Indy. Well maintained, nice scenery, and nice pace of play. Two of us teed off at 7:30am, we were done by 11. 4 of the last 5 holes are very challenging, with the whole 18 playing as an intermediate level course. Definitely going back for another early morning tee time soon"
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"I teed off at 7:30 am, and the course was perfect. I've played this course 8-10 times now, and this was easily the best shape I've seen the fairways, greens, and tees. Finished 18 in 3:10."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"You’d think with a month off the course would be in perfect condition. It wasn’t too wet but cart path only which I understand is why the pace was so slow. Thing that made me upset was how bad the grass was. I get it, it was raining the day before but the grass was too long and thick couldn’t even hit it out of the rough let alone even find it."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,ProsGreens consist speed and smoothTees and fairways good shapeStaff very friendlyCarts goodConsCarts on cart path onlyCourse lot of standing water in fairwaysBunkers need work
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"I really like this course and the way they maintain it. Staff is always friendly, pace is usually pretty good. What can you do if it's busy though it's like that at any course. Great layout challenging but also A place where your wild drive can be recovered."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Always a good course to play and the staff is great! Pace is ALWAYS slow on Saturday afternoons
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Depending on the tee selection you chose to play , this course can be very long or short ! Some tricky par 5’s ! The wind always plays with your ball on the par 3’s . The par 4’s are about average for a city course ! A good place to practice and the driving in back is a great place to tune up your game !"
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"I bought a voucher off facebook that allowed us to play the course for $18 with a cart. For Indianapolis and busy Greenwood this is outstanding value. The layout is standard city parkland style: pretty flat, lots of down and back holes, a variety of par 3 length holes. The greens were in decent shape, but the bunkers were washed out. There staff was friendly, and we got around quick!"
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Check out Smock if you are in the Indy area. She is a solid muni!
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Grew up playing this course, and glad to see it is still in solid shape all around. Course plays long, so intend on hitting some long irons into the green. Indy has received a lot of rain over the last month, so fairways were off limits on Par-5s when I played, and some sections of fairway were roped off for repair. They've really narrowed fairways, for some odd reason, and have removed some bunkers around the course over the years. Also, they've allowed grass to grow high around the creeks. Fairways, rough and greens were all in great shape and really enjoyed playing the course. Bunkers all around have just been let go and it seems to be a theme with public courses in Central Indiana. Definitely worth the $29 to play twilight on a Saturday. Shot a 43-40 for an 83 from the white tees."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,From afar this course looks like a simple easy course. On the course it is challenging with water and small creek meandering through holes. If you miss the fairways the challenge is the rough which was nicely kept and could have been even more challenging if a bit longer. The greens were very nice and we'll kept with no disease this late into the summer. Nice course for our junior players. Staff was friendly and pro shop and clubhouse were nice.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"The course is nothing special. Not bad, not good. Watch out for blind lakes and streams on some holes, which mostly go back and forth."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Two major complaints: 1) the pace of play sucked - just under 5 hours on a Friday late morning/early afternoon. 2) the greens were hard as a rock. If you flew it on the green, it took a huge bounce. If you landed short on most holes, since the greens were slightly elevated, it wouldn't bounce on. Also , the fringe isn't really fringe. So if your ball nestled against it, you needed to blade a wedge to putt, even though you're on the green because the grass/rough was high and patchy behind it."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Don't get me wrong, it was in decent shape for this level of course, and you can do a lot worse around here. But be prepared for a long kinda boring round."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"I really enjoy this golf course. It is one of the lengthiest golf courses in central Indiana and has parts that have a lot of hills. The course definitely rewards you for hitting the fairway. The only down side when I played was that there were some areas that didn't drain water very well, but most of the course was dry. Definitely an enjoyable and challenging golf course."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Nice facilities. I look forward to going back later in the season once the grass has bounced back and can be cut.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"I have only played Smock one other time and couldn't remember how interesting the course is. The fairway grass is in great shape and we had the entire place to ourselves due to a threat of rain, which never did materialized. The fall colors were beautiful and it was a super, fun afternoon. Friendly staff with free refills on soda....who can beat that? We will be back for sure."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,This place exceeded my expectations in every possible way. I will definitely play there again.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,The course is in fantastic condition. The greens roll very fast and true. We are never disappointed after playing at Smock!
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,The play at Smock is PAINFULLY SLOW!! NO ONE will let you play through and no one seems to play fast. I came up behind a walking 2-some on the 5th hole and they refused to let me...a single in a cart...play through. I had to play behind them...watching every shot they took... virtually the whole round. Ended up getting pinned behind a 4-some that seemed to have decided 6hrs was a good pace for 18 holes. My complaint...really...is that there are NO RANGERS anywhere to make slow players setp aside for faster players...or a SINGLE! The end expereince was a miserable round of golf. 80 degrees...sunny...no wind and the round was miserable. I will not be back to Smock due to the pace of play.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Very busy for a Thursday afternoon. Aways seems to be backed up. Purchased as 2 players and were paired up. But noticed behind us there were a few twosomes. If you are looking to play quick and only with a buddy, I would not recommend this course. Its very long and it took 5 hours to play as a foursome, which we originally wanted to play as a twosome so we could get done in a reasonable time."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Long and challenging par 3s. Par 4s are mostly forgiving and not too long. Greens are in good shape and the pin placements were a good test - I didn't quite pass the test but had fun.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Excellent course with a fair but challenging layout
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,this course is somewhat challenging...but if you do like the old saying goes----> Play the course & don't let it play you.... you will do fine.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"The fairways, greens and rough were all in the best condition I've ever seen. The bunkers had lots of sand for the first time I could remember. It only took my threesome 3 hours and 30 minutes to play 18. That is a first on this course!!!"
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Course is in excellent condition with the amount of rain this year. Staff were very Professional. Will play again soon. Thank you
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,I like it very much and I intend to play there often
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Firm but forgiving greens, tee boxes in good condition, fairways could use more water to soften them.Overall nice experience. Will play again."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,First time on this course for my 3 playing partners. They frequently commented during the round what a nice course it was--couldn't believe it was a municipal course. Very well maintained.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,This course is simi long with well maintained big greens with lots of curves to the putts . This course gives the average golfer a challenge as to where their game is.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,I payed $25 on line. This was the best course I have ever played for that price. Pace of play would have been faster but it wast first time playing there. Great pro shop.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Course matured since played 15 years ago. Very challenging course and in great shape for anyone to enjoy a round of golf.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Had a great time with my Wife and two Sons. Beautiful day at a great course.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Great value. Course was in great shape with difficult pin placement. Club house and golf carts were in perfect condition
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Surprised with the weather that the place wasn't packed full.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,My father and I were paired up with another father-son duo and had a great time. Everyone on the course was friendly and followed golf etiquette. The staff at Smock was very friendly and using golfnow.com made getting out on the course simple and easy. This course is very well maintained and has a few challenging holes. Even in windy conditions we had a great time. I would recommend this course to any who want a fun and challenging round at a nice course.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"We tee off at 7:30 AM, no issues with pace, coarse was in great shape and kept clean. Greens were consistent and also in good condition.I will play at Smock again, great deal on GOLF NOW!"
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Always enjoyed Smock haven't played in a few years surprised that very few golfers were out , used to taking close to 6 hrs to play, played under 4 disappointed to see the. ponds haven't been taken care ofThe young man working the counter was a bit of a smart aleck"
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Smock is a nice course with a beautiful layout. The course was in extremely playable condition. The rough was cut and the greens were average speed.It made for a fun day.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,The course is well cared for. It is a long course on a large area of land. I would recommend playing here.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"I like this course for its early tee times and the deals it offers. However, the bugs on this course have been out of hand the last couple rounds I've played there. Hard to stand over a tee shot or putt with the bugs swarming."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Course plays long ad it is worth the price fairways are nice. But beware of Bod he work ther and is not a very nice person. I gave him a ero on personality..
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"I had a good time playing this course. It was well manicured. Pace of play was a bit slow, but what place isn't at times."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,This course is well maintained. The golf carts ran well. The par threes are a great test for all golfers.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"I've not seen Smock be in any better condition, a very enjoyable round."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,The course was in good condition. The fairways were in very good shape. The greens rolled with consistency. Great price for 18 holes on a sunny Friday afternoon.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Greens and fairways well maintained and groomed. Course played quickly and was enjoyable.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Good layout and the course was in good condition. Players beware however; rough can be pretty brutal in areas. I'd recommend it though overall
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Course is in better than average condition, plenty of challenging holes, enough water, and thick rough.I enjoyed playing this course, and will come back to it again."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Great course for the money. Very good condition. Generally open and forgiving, but plenty of places to get in trouble."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,I was overwhelmed by the course! I was very impressed at the layout! Challenging yet fun!!!
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Smock was a great course in excellent condition and golfnow made it easy
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Good solid course, well manicured especially for the price. Would definitely play again due the quality of course compared with the price we paid."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Made it hard to find a rhythm. Slow pace cart path only
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Very long course with plenty of trouble! Slow greens from early spring mowing height, but rolled true. Pretty good character for an inner city course with teeth for those wanting a challenge!"
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"The rating given was based on the time of year played, March 18th 2014.Having played here before, great course!!! Would definitely recommend."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Great. Course, very few obstructions in terms of natural plantation etc. holes were easy to located. Course was I superb condition, though greens were aerated."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"...greens were SATURATED WITH SAND!!! I understand the need to aerate, especially after an entire weekend with 2-3"" of rain, but there was soooooo much sand on the greens, unless you got the ball close on an approach shot, you can count on a multiple-putt hole. Aside from the greens (and an occasional over-grown rough), the course is in great shape. Have always loved the layout."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,green in great shape. fairways perfect length to hit irons off of!
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"This course was in incredible shape all around, greens were fast and challenging but overall a very playable course. I'll be back for sure"
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"I hadn't played Smock in a few years and now I realize I have been missing out. The staff is so super friendly, they make coming out worthwhile on their own. Had an early tee time and the pace of play was great. Never any waiting or feeling like some was breathing down our necks."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"I have played this course many times over the years and I must say this year its in the best shape I have ever seen it. The course layout is great, good value for how well the coures was maintained. I have played courses for twice the money that were no better, so deffinitly give Somck a go for your next round."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Tee time on schedule. Good pace on course. Course is in good shape and well maintained. I like the layout.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Its a great course with a great staff. I normally play alone, and they paired me with a great couple, just shows the course attracts good people...thanks"
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Over all the course is in pretty good shape the greens hold moderately well. The bunkers need a lot of attention though.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Love this course! Par 5s are reachable in 3, Greens are in great shape."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,course was in good shape except greens needed mowing and were slower than usual
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Got to the course 1/2 hour before my tee time. Checked in and was told they had 80 couples with an outing. An hour later, 1/2 hour after I should have teed off I am still on the first tee box. No Starter, No Ranger to help with pace of play. 40 minutes later I make it to the first green. Unreal!!! Started bouncing around all over the course trying to find a hole to play. Have no idea what I shot that day. It was a lot of wasted time. Finally just left, to save myself the frustration at playing at a golf course and staff that just does not care."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,The layout alone no matter the condition is worth the money!! Very busy but never had to wait long! Will play this course again. The driving range you have to drive your car to if you wanted to warm up before your round.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Good course and good value, would play again. Lay ups on par 5's and a couple of par 3's well bunkered. Good stuff."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,This was my first time on this course. I will definitely return! The fairways are great and the greens are challenging. In addition they have a great driving range facility.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Really like the course. Greens were in great shape and the par 3's are very challenging.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"It had been 20 years since I played this course. My, how the trees have grown. The staff was Very helpful, especially the pro shop attendant. Course was in very good shape and I very muct enjoyed my round. Will be playing here again in the future."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,I like to play first thing in the morning and a lot of courses do not accommodate the need for me to play around 6:00. I was able to tee off at 6:17 and get my round in and into work at a great time. The course was in great condition.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,The course was in good shape. Greens good fairways good. Even the adult beverages were reasonably priced..
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"As an average golfer (16 handicap) I have a love/hate relationship with this course. I've played it many times over the years. It's kept in great condition for a city course, plays long from the tips, and is generously open (nice for those of us who struggle off the tee). However, the pace of play is ridiculously slow. I had not played here in about 2 years because the last time I did it took over 5 hours. This time I scheduled an early 7.33A tee time hoping to get out early with my buddy (a 10 handicap) & smoke the course. We were at the tee box at 7.13A, no other groups were around, but because the starter's notepad said there were other groups ahead of us, we weren't aloud to tee off. After those groups finally arrived, we were paired up with another twosome & we teed of at almost 7.45A. We walked off the 18th green at 1.00P. CRAZY! I enjoy the course, but will not take the time to return."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"A little course knowledge goes a long way at Smock. Some hazards are not apparent at first, such as the creek on the first hole, which cannot be seen from the first fairway. The course has a few water hazards in play and a handful of bunkers, but the real hazards are subtle, like strategically placed trees and thick rough that swallows golf balls. Golfers should check yardages carefully; often the scorecard and tee box signs conflict. (Smock should get accurate measurements for sprinkler heads and tee boxes -- or perhaps invest in GPS units for the carts.) The driving range is oddly located on the far back end of the course, so a quick, pre-round warm-up is not an option."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Great muni with some challenging holes, above adequate green complexes and excellent fairways. This course would challenge even low handicap players, but can still be fun for all with good course management"
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Early in year, so course will be in better shape. Greens were a little bumpy. Overall, course was in decent shape."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,The course was rough because it is wintertime. I've played this course dozens of times because it is close to my house. It is one of the longer and tougher public courses in Indianapolis.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Although several inches of snow had recently melted followed by several inches of rain the next two days, the fairways were lush (even if slushy) and the greens were smooth ( even if longish). The new bridges are better than those on much more expensive courses."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Greens 7on a scale of 10 on pace and condition, fairways same score, for playing in Dec, wet but playable, need to restripe cart paths for distance markers to help with speed of play."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,The course is challenging but very forgiving when you play the right shot. Course is in good shape expescially for this time of year.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"One of our foursome had not played this course before and wanted to do so. I had not played Smock for a couple years so it was good to play the course again. We had a really good time and each of us was pleasantly surprised at the good condition of the course, especially the greens."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"This course is linear, it is very interesting also long distance.In addition, the price is also reasonable.Speaking of greed say, green is a little more fast."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Thank you.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"Din not like the blue grass fairways, green and tee boxes whre fine some slow palyers ho where not attentive to the groups behind them. Fairly difficult course"
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,Course was well maintained especially given the harsh summer we have had. Really enjoyed the variety of holes no 2 exactly alike. Not many hazards but that makes for smoother play with any handicap.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,"We chose this course out of proximity to an event we were in town for. Thanks to golfnow we got a great price and a favorable tee time so we decided to go. I was super pleased with everything. Friendly staff, great choice of beverages and a pretty well kept track considering the lack of rain in the area this year. Lots of blind shots and some deep bunkers make it a really fun challenging course. Some water pictured on scorecard but for the most part no real danger. Very well kept greens, rolled fast and true and it looked like the regulars repair their divots. I'll definitely be back to this course."
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,The fairways and greens were in very good condition especially with the lack of rain this season. A nice course with an affordable fee as well.
Smock Golf Course,5812-smock-golf-course,I gave this course 4 stars because of the greens. They were super fast and true. I've not played better greens. The rest of the course was average...nothing special. We were paired up with a member there who was friendly and helpful as it was the first time we played. The course was packed so the pace of play was a little on the slower side but was expected by judging the parking lot when we pulled in. We waited in line at the first tee to start for about a half as there was a fog delay for earlier starting times.
Whispering Hills Golf Course,544-whispering-hills-golf-course,"I have played this course many times, actually was the first course I played. I love the layout and never have any issues with pace, the holes are challenging yet fair and can be a blast for any skill level. Staff is great and the food and beer are good and priced fair. I will be coming back."
Whispering Hills Golf Course,544-whispering-hills-golf-course,"I used to enjoy playing here because it played quickly, was usually in decent shape, and allowed me to improve my game. But over the last couple of years, the greens get worse and worse and the course has played SO SLOW with people often not allowing singles or two-somes to play through. The course layout is fun enough, but people don’t fix their ball dings in the greens and they roll very slow and often have dead grass. The 8th green last time I played looked like strips were torn up on the green. This course is nothing more than an after work or twilight course in my opinion, if it plays fast enough."
Whispering Hills Golf Course,544-whispering-hills-golf-course,"Very good course, Short but sweet . It has Hills and Valleys an Sand and Water . And when its dry its fun to play."
Dakota Landing Golf Club,5802-dakota-landing-golf-club,"Frankly the course itself is trash, but the pace of play is good and if you can get a good deal then it’s worth it. If you’re not a serious golfer or are taking a non golfer with you then it’s a good fit."
Dakota Landing Golf Club,5802-dakota-landing-golf-club,Played here and it was surprisingly good! It has a nice open layout with fast greens and bouncy fairways. Very forgiving for beginners! I had a great round here today and definitely look forward to going back.
Dakota Landing Golf Club,5802-dakota-landing-golf-club,Today my brother Mike and son Joshua and myself played 18 holes. We booked on Golfnow and got hot deal. We have played here before. Course was in really good shape for this late in season. Will definitely play many more times going forward and would recommend this course to everyone!
Dakota Landing Golf Club,5802-dakota-landing-golf-club,Walked right in 8:45am on a Thursday played a quick in an about an hour. Was a nice easier course will definitely play again
Dakota Landing Golf Club,5802-dakota-landing-golf-club,My brother Mike and myself booked tee time on Golfnow (hot deal). We have played here before. At time of playing course was In fair condition. We got behind some really slow players and refused to let us play thru. Our cart was really slow and tee boxes could have used a little care. once we finished first 9 we able to play in hour 25 minutes. Great little course just needs a little care be a great value course. Will play here again and recommend to others.
Dakota Landing Golf Club,5802-dakota-landing-golf-club,My brother and myself booked tee time thru Golfnow as hot deal. We got to course early and checked in. Course looked busy but no wait on 1st tee. Overall course in good shape. Would like see tee boxes better kept but not real bad. Would recommend to anyone looking for a challenge.
Dakota Landing Golf Club,5802-dakota-landing-golf-club,The course was in horrible shape. Tee box’s were y’all needed mowed as well as the fairway. The greens were slow because they needed mowed as well. Weeds everywhere it was hard to find your ball in the fairway. We only played 9 of the 18 we paid for because it took almost 3 hours to play 9. All in all will not bother to ever play again. When we got there we got some range balls and the guy said he should have a cart once we are done. As we were walking back he had one.
Dakota Landing Golf Club,5802-dakota-landing-golf-club,Nice little course they try to maintain as best they can. Quick to play through if no one else is on the course.
Dakota Landing Golf Club,5802-dakota-landing-golf-club,This was the 2nd time i booked on Golfnow to play Dakota Landings. My son and brother and myself had a 9:00am tee time. We was able to get out on time and pace was a little slow due to course very busy. We all had a good time and will play here again in future.Only complaint would be to have a little better tee boxes.
Dakota Landing Golf Club,5802-dakota-landing-golf-club,"This was our 1st time playing here. We noticed tee boxes was a little over grown and fairways could be more defined and cut. 1ST 9 pace was fine, 2nd 9 pace was horrible. 3 people playing in front of us refused to let us play thru and was hitting multiple balls and driving cart thru tee boxes and over greens. I let staff know when we finished and they apologize. I will come back and play there again to give 2nd chance. i would recommend to others to play there s well. ."
Orchard Golf Center,5773-orchard-golf-center,This course is a cheap par 3 course. You get what you pay for and it’s great to start out and learn the game
Orchard Golf Center,5773-orchard-golf-center,"Terrible golf course... People are rude... As soon as we walked in we got a bad attitude from the lady at front desk... Online it says carts included and we find out it’s not golf carts that it’s push carts for 18 holes... We got told to hurry by the guy that was mowing the grass... you’re better off playing the little bit of extra money to play a better course, with golf carts, and better customer service! If there was negative stars I would give that...."

Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,Eagle Creek is a nice facility with two 18 hole courses. We played the Pines Course and really enjoyed it. Would love to go back and play the Sycamore Course some time.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,"The course was in strong shape and a very good challenge. The opening tee shot is elevated and has a nice view. A number of holes were tree lined and relatively tight but other holes were quite open off the tee. While the greens were in good shape, quick and rolled true, it was surprising to see how many greens had SO many huge unrepaired ball marks on them. I tried to do my part and must have fixed at least two or three on every green. Course has some interesting elevation changes, too."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,We got a twilight rate of $36 and it was a good value. One of the better true munis I’ve played and I’d even be willing to pay the full rate. All the staff we dealt with were wonderfully friendly. The one downer was how crowded the course was and our round took well over five hours.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,"As a beginner golfer, it definitely provided plenty of opportunities to lose balls in the tall grass. The elevation changes were very interesting and fun to play. I'm looking forward to returning here."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,"The Pines course at Eagle Creek is a Dye course, though it doesn't have all the usual characteristics of one. It does have a lot of elevation change, but it also does meander back and forth a bit with lots of straightforward holes. Although there are a few doglegs that you need to know where to go/miss. The fairways are in horrible shape, with lots of mud pits and where there is grass it was as long as the rough is on some local courses. Greens were patchy here and there, but ran true. Tees were chewed at times."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,"It's nothing special, but if you can get on cheap it's worth a go. Wouldn't be a bad course for beginners to learn on."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,It has probably been over 15 years since I played this course last. Used to play it a lot when I lived off 46th St. It has changed a bit but for the better and is still a challenge. Nice layout and the scenery is pretty. Changes in elevation are a nice change of pace. Played my wife and two daughters. Nice course for families and juniors.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,Eagle Creek is a nice track that holds it's own against the more modern courses built in the last 15 years.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,Tee Times to close togetherneed just a little more time between goupsgot into slow play
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,"For the price, Eagle Creek is one of the best open to the public courses in Central Indiana. Two Pete Dye courses offer plenty of challenges to all levels of players."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,"During our late afternoon round, we saw no fewer than 25 deer casually grazing on the course grounds."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,"For a late summer day, the course was in excellent condition. Greens were quick that day and offered plenty of challenges."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,"The only thing I was unhappy with was the condition of the sand in the bunkers. I found myself in them a couple of times and both were very hardpan lies and you could see that they don't drain very well. Other than that, the course was a pleasure to play."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,We'll definitely be back.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,"You can't beat this for a public course. Very good layout, great facilities and friendly people."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,Accommodating and friendly staff (Rangers and clubhouse). Sun King on sale! Decent course in very good shape. ..Great value for $15 (Hot Deal)
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,"Nice course. Tees, fairways, and greens were in very good shape. The greens rolled true. We had to wait at the first tee for a but as two groups were in front of us but didn't see anyone in front or behind us for the rest of the round. Pace of play was four hours (not bad). Landscaping crews were annoying on a few holes but that happens in the morning on occasion. Good layout and fairly wide open. I would play here again."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,This is a very spacious county golf course with mainly broad fairways. Greens are in fair condition but nobody fixes ball marks. Range has good distance markers but you are hitting off the original pasture! A few awesome holes. Good place to bring your family..
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,Not a top rated track like Purgatory or the Fort but the Sycamore offers a great value. Plays like the Fort. Every hole has a new look. Blind tee shots can make your first time more difficult. Trust your game & swing. If you can drive it straight you'll be ok.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,Fun course to go out and play which gives you some challenges. The course if long from the whites but you have a lot of fairway to work with on most holes.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,Some of the fairways looked like my yard. I remember when eagle creek was the place to play. Not what I thought.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,Course is in great shape and greens are awesome!!!
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,The Pines course is average. Some challenging holes and some easy holes. I would definitely recommend the Sycamore course over the Pines. I felt the Sycamore was in better shape.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,"This course was in great condition. Having played many public courses in the Indianapolis area, this summer, the fairways and greens at this course, I would rank in the top three. Play moved reasonable pace, with no waiting."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,"Played on Sunday with scattered rain in forecast - never had anyone on the holes I front or behind us. Played 18 in 3 hours. Course is in great shape. Nice clubhouse, driving range, putting greens."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,"This course was a good test for a golfer who scores slightly higher than bogey golf. The holes generally required multiple good shots to score par or better, but there were few places where a single bad shot doomed you to triple bogey. Plenty of places to recover and not kill the round. Also, they do a great job of playing with doglegs and elevation changes to compensate for some shorter par 4's."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,I really enjoyed this course. It is a great course for an intermediate golfer like myself because the front 9 is pretty difficult but the back 9 is a bit easier. Overall the course conditions were great and I'd definitely play there again in the future.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,"Loved this course. Great layout, great facilities. Plenty of practice greens... there are actually two 18 hole courses here; I played the sycamore course and can't wait to play the pines course. The course has many different challenges ranging from rollings hills, bunkered greens, a fair amount of water and plenty of tree lined fairways to lose your ball. The night I played here I saw a total of 12 deer on the course, very pleasing course to the eye, no houses are on the course. I will be playing here again ASAP."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,Course was in great shape. Pace of play was good. Staff was very friendly.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,Would play again. Challenging but fair course. Would play again.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,Course was in good shape ; greens were slow but true
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,Course layout is fun. It's not too difficult. A lot of holes play fairly straight. The greens are in very good condition and are not too fast. Good pace of play. Would definitely go back.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,Booked a tee time on golfnow and saved 46%. Great price for the course.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,Only complaint was the clubhouse was only selling hot dogs for food (early season menu I suppose) and credit card machine was down.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,Course was in decent shape considering the drought.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,"The greens were fine, not good. The course itself was in fairly good condition from tee to green. Slow play with no ranger, only a starter. Overall, it was average."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,"The couse was well maintained, greens and fairways were in good condition. The course is not very challanging, but does require a little thinking.Staff was pleasant.Great course for the money.Highly recomended."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,"Tees, Greens and Fairways in good shape and maintained."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,The greens are in good shape. They roll nice. The speed does vary slightly to the quicker side on the greens that are more elevated. The holes are challenging with a variety of shots required throughout the course. Fairways were below average but still decent. Sand traps were in excellent shape.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,Overall value is decent to above average for the 30$
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,"Eagle Creek has two of the best public courses in the Indianapolis area… I played the Pines on this day and it was in great condition. Trees and fairways were very well maintained. The rough was extremely penal (as it should be). Some bunkers could have been better raked and sifted (though I never found myself in any of them ;-)). My only complaint was the tee boxes were a bit beat up and the green speeds varied greatly form hole to hole. While the Pines is typically considered the easier of the two courses at Eagle Creek, It is still a good challenge for golfers of all abilities."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,Nice course on the west side with plenty of scenery and wild life. The fairways were in average condition at best but the greens were in good shape. I would play here again and would like to try the Sycamore course as well.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,"Out of towers trying to steal a deal, $20 early morning round. Started in fog, completely blind with no course map. Frustratingly because fairways, and first cut were long , lost balls even when hitting the fairway. Course management need to address to get to next level. That all being said greens excellent condition and overall value well worth it. Will come back again next time in Indy."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,"course was very wet, and we only played one 9 hole course 2xwould have like to have played one of the other courses, but next time!"
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,"The idea that you can just go cut the grass every other day, has left this place in bad shape. It is convienient to work so we often play it after work but if it wasn't for golf now getting us great deals I'd never play it. Last time it was just $12, it isn't worth more than $20. Hope it gets better."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,My fiance was treated very poorly. The guy in the clubhouse was not nice enough to get a job at Wal Mart.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,"Both of the courses at Eagle Creek are great. The Pines course is a bit more open which in my opinion makes it a little easier than Sycamore. The course was in pretty good condition for this time of year, with the only exception being the greens were a little rough in spots. All-in-all, this is one of my favorite courses, and a great way to spend a Saturday is to play all 36 holes at Eagle Creek!"
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,"I could never pass up 15 dollars for 18 and a cart on a sometimes challenging course. This was a great deal, buy it now!!"
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Pines Course,543-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-pines-course,Would definitely play here again. Has two courses pines and sycamore. Enjoyed sycamore more but pines might be more difficult. Great value in city.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,It is a fun course and was in great shape. I think for $32 (w/Cart) mid-week is a great price for such a nice course.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,I did not have a tee time (although I did call to make one earlier in the week and was told they do not take tee times for singles). I almost didn't play this course because of the policy but I am on vacation and decided to wing it..
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,"Anyway, I was able to get on the course within a half hour of arriving (played on a Thursday at 10:30 am) but I don't get the course policy of ""we don't take tee times for singles."" I wonder how hard it is to get on as a single during a busy summer weekend."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,The best way to describe this course (from the forward tees) is that it is not too long (so pars and birdies are out there) and the challenge is the elevation changes (tee to fairway or fairway into greens) and some greens are tricky to read.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,"There are a few blind spots and a bit of water but not too difficult to maneuver. The #1 handicap hole is 15 but I think the 18th hole is trickier because there is water on the left and a small creek on the right so you have a very small ""window"" to hit (and have a ball roll) to the green. Better to hit a good drive so you can hit your next shot on the green."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,"Overall, I would play this course again and often if I lived in Indiana."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,"This is a review of the Sycamore course. It is a fun test with a lot of elevation change, and some greens are very small. All the greens have a good degree of tilt, but do not seem to break as much as it looks."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,"Being another Dye course around here, it reminded me a lot of The Fort, just not as tricked up and sloped. But this course definitely holds its own with some tough holes, like 15 which requires a precise drive to a plateau then hitting across to a perched green. There are some blind shots out there, so be careful when it's busy. Several tight holes to start as well."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,"All in all, it's worth the trip out of the city to play. Even here at the end of February, it was in good shape overall, with a few mud patches here and there on the greens. One complaint: they did not have enough staff or food for this warm day so the snack bar was closed. So take an extra snack in your bag before going just in case."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,Have played other Pete Dye courses and this one ranks right there in the top. Fun and challenging layout. Peaceful and scenic. One of Indy's best for the price. Nice discount to senior golfers.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,A friend and I enjoyed this course. It was freezing outside but we're hard core and decided to brave it. We played the Sycamore. Leaves made it a challenge finding shots but the change in elevations on several holes made the course challenging but not overly difficult.The clubhouse is nothing to write home about but the staff was friendly.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,"Was cool outside & we caught a pop-up rain shower, but course was in mostly good shape. There were some spots that had too much water & had been muddied up (not sure we had enough rain lately to be the culprit). Tees, fairways & greens were all in good shape. Greens rolled true. We got zero fairway roll with the rain, but expected that. Course has as lot of elevation changes and is a great fall track to enjoy the colors. Some of the best holes in the area out here. With the weather, we had one gent in front of us, we played thru, so we flew around."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,Always in good condition. Leafs on some holes. Deer and pineapples lol always happy to play here.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,My only negative comment is this. After hole 9 there was no chance to go into the club house at the turn. You go straight from hole 9-10. I wished they would have warned us as it was the time of day I could have really used the opportunity to stop and get something to eat.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,Loved everything about the course. Used to be one of indianapolis's best. Would give 5 stars across the board if other players would fix their divets on the greens. Several holes looked like a minefield. My foursome took ten minutes on several holes just to fix
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,It had been a few years since I played this course. Great scenery and some challenging holes. Played in a little rain (it always rains when I play this course)..but no standing water. Shoot my best score to date on this track. Good to play every few years.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,Nice course but need rangers to keep pace of slower golfers. Cart paths can be somewhat confusing to someone who doesn't play here very often. No access to clubhouse for beer or other amenities at the turn.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,"I like Eagle Creek golf and with exception to only one or two holes I really like the Sycamore Course. It's convenient, a good value and well maintained. It's not the caliber of someplace like the fort or bear slide but if you play here and work it into your cycle of regular courses you wont be disappointed."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,"Started raining between 5&6 hole, lighting between 6 & 7 hole, went to club house asked for a rain check , I was told no because of the type and time of play , tee time was 2:30. I am requesting a refund because of a rained out and no raid check."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,"On the 6th hole it started to rain , then on the 7th hole lighting and , thunder , we went to the club house for a rain check and, was told there is no rain check on this type of purchase , very disappointed , requesting a refund to my credit card"
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,The course was in good condition although the greens weren't as fast as usual. It had rained the day before so they probably didn't get a chance to cut them. The bunkers could use some work. Overall it was a good day.
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,Good course for the money. Unique challenges all over the course. Pace of play could be better
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,This. Course is a must play for any golfer in Indy or visiting from out of town. Extremely challenging and well maintained
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,"Pro Shop Staff, insisted on having a copy of comfirmation or # or ID....Didn't have it on me...Couldn't find our res....STARTER cordial but not on his list either...Couldn't tee off...Went back to shop....at that time was told my res was for the other course...more arguing...Went to car got phone...bac to shop, showed my res to ROY, said to us , I dont know how that happened?....sorry, but you will have to tee off on the other course, we have a league!....45min later wasn't worth the Hot Deal price...Pines for 9holes ..Sycamore 4holes...darkness"
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,"There obviously has not been much work done to the course over the last month. The main problem was the lack of work done on all of the bunkers. There are actually weeds growing in the fairway bunkers. I understand that staff is reduced for this time of year but there could at least be some effort spent on the traps or the fees should be reduced to reflect some of that. Tees, fairways and greens were acceptable."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,"Although the leaves were off the trees, the views were still lovely. And the leaves were in the woods, not on the greens or fairways. Despite the long, dry periods punctuated by too much rain, the course was in gloriously green shape. I had not played here for two years and could hardly tell which were the new or reconfigured holes, because they had grown in so well."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,course was in great shape and played at a reasonable pace
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,"we went out and rain was in the forcast, luckly i had a cart cover and a coleman heater. we where warm and tried to stay dry. the first 4 holes it rained and then stopped. no one was out there and we had the course to our self. the deer where ouit and the greens where medium speed. over all had a great time and the course was very nice."
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,This course give you great value for what your $$. The course and facilities are a lot nicer than what you normally get for this green fee
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,"AS WITH ALL RN THOMPSON COURSES THEY DO [ NOT ]HAVE VERY GOOD COURSE MAINTANCE. THE BUNKERS [LACK SAND] GREENS ONLY FAIR, MANTANCE AT THIS COURSE ,BETTER THEN ANY OF HIS OTHER PROPERTYS.I LIVE WITH IN 5MINS AND AND PLAYED SEVERAL TIMES,MORE MAINTANCE ON CART PATHS THEN COURSE. WITH THE NUMBER OF LARGE OUTINGS ALL SUMMER I WOULD NOT THINK MONEY WOULD BE ISSUE"
Eagle Creek Golf Club - The Sycamore Course,549-eagle-creek-golf-club-the-sycamore-course,"Played the Sycamore Course. This is your classic style Indiana course. There are plenty of trees, some water, a few traps, and hilly terrain to navigate. Some of the holes appeared longer than they actualy were. But, then again, my eye sight is not getting any better! Greens were in good condition, with average speed. A low handicapper would probably score well on this course. It is just difficult enough for a middle handicapper to make it quite challenging. I would not recommend it to beginners."
Shortee's Golf Course,29714-shortee-s-golf-course,"The owner just told me to get the F*** out because I was hitting 4 inches in front of the ropes. The area within the ropes had no grass and was only mud. Not only that, there were a ton of divots in the area I chose, so I wouldn’t mess any more grass up. Also, I was hitting a driver so those don’t make divots. Definitely not somewhere I would take kids, or anyone for that matter. Called me “entitled” 5-6 times. I had been going there for years and he just lost my business along with anyone I can tell not to go there. Classless."
Shortee's Golf Course,29714-shortee-s-golf-course,If you like short game or need to improve it this is for you perfect way to spend a couple hours. Playing here has really helped my game and it's a great place to get a quick game in. I will be a lifetime customer.
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"The golf course did not have signs of hole numbers , teeing boxes, and the grass is not well maintained I guess it’s because of winter . But I was not satisfied"
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"It was below freezing when I started, so not ideal by any stretch of the imagination. It was still winter so I wasn't expecting much. I played 9 here on my way back from Spring Break and the course was within 5 minutes of my hotel so I figured why not."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"I made a good decision coming here. Everything was in good shape. For it being march and it being a muni course, the greens were excellent. The bunkers were hard and had almost no sand but this course doesn't have a ton of them. No maps of the holes but the back of the scorecard had a decent enough detailed map. Cart we had was fine. The guy in the pro shop was as nice as could be and respected our courage. Ended up shooting a 38 +3. I like how the greens had unique shapes and slopes to them and so did the fairways. Not at all a boring feeling course. Very nice mix of difficult holes (460 par 4 with water was ridiculous), and scoring opportunities. Would be a very easy walking course as well and I would have had it been a nicer day. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll be back."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"I have reviewed Sahm on more than one occasion previously, and the course continues to grow on me. It isn't difficult or overly visually intimidating, but it has a ton of character that allows any golfer to enjoy the course. I think I have finally learned to tame the 12 hole beast as I lipped out for birdie last time. A big bend around the trees is the play off the tee! Great customer service and fun time playing as always. Course was in usual late November shape."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"Sahm is a great walking course as it is older, relatively flat and the tees and greens are close enough together. It stays pretty busy being in the heart of the Castleton. The greens normally are some of the most pure in the city that i have played. The staff is super friendly."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"The course was pretty beat up when we played and there were pock marks all over the greens. There was a moderate amount of water damage, but the spring rain was torture on all courses around the area. The sand could use work and the practice facilities are moderate at best."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,Sahm is always a great time and genuinely one of my favorite courses in Indy. I would say give it a go anytime!
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,Even though it was Sunday. The course moved very well only waited on a couple of shots. Weather was good and the course in good condition.
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,The greens and fairways were in great shape had a great time will definitely be back
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,Sahms is a great course to play. The only problem we had was the pace of play due to a family playing very slow and would not let faster players play thru. I believe this was very rude.
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"I think this is a great course for a duffer like me. Hard to get into too much trouble. Long drives are not important, as most holes are manageably short. Fairly flat piece of land, so you are almost always playing from level ground, so that is nice. Very little water or sand, so most of your trouble is well placed trees. I would look at this course like a higher end, very well maintained ""muni"" type course"
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"I have played Sahm about a dozen times now, and I always enjoy the round. The course is fairly easy as there are very few hazards on the course. The greens roll very true and putt as well as anything in the city. The price point is excellent for walking 18 holes in the city. It is pretty flat which makes for a great walking round. The staff is always friendly and able to help out. I have heard horror stories of people taking 5-6 hours to play the course, but I have never experienced this."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,The course was in great condition and a good value for the price.
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,It was Saturday at one of the few good public courses on the north side so I expected it to be slow but as usual even though the pace seemed slow… we still got around in about 4 hours which is usually the case even when it is slow. There have been days when we played in 2 1/2 hours at Sahm so it all evens out.
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,Sahm's is a great course for the price. It's fairly open and not too difficult. Definitely on our list of regular spots. Staff is great.
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"This, being ""Dye's first 18 hole course"", is pretty straightforward by any standard. Some of the Dye hallmarks are there, like small chipping areas and greens that you need to hit for a spot and not necessarily the pin. But there is very little water or sand to trip you up, so the greens and mature trees are the primary defense. They ran a little slower than others around town, but rolled true. Some doglegs give room to cut the corner leaving short approaches if you do. It has a reputation of beings slow and packed, but we got there early and breezed through in 3 hours as a twosome. It won't knock your socks off, but you can do worse than here,"
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,Only one or two challenging holes. Course was very dry
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"If you are looking for a long challenging course, go elsewhere. Sahm is a great course for sneaking in a quick round and knocking off some rust. This an extremely scoreable course, with Par 5's that are reachable in 2 and a couple driveable par 4's. It is pretty cool to say you played Pete Dye's first 18-hole design, but don't expect it to be similar to his more recent layouts. Lots of open space, so despite short length, you can knock your driver around all day if you so please. About as good a value as you can find in the Indy area."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"The course has a nice layout with surprisingly fast greens. You can easily go low on this course with its short length. Fairways and rough are decently maintained, however the bunkers aren't anything I recommend hitting out of.They do not enforce pace of play. Ran into a foursome holding up the entire front 9 behind them. Claimed they had too many people want to play through and that we could wait or skip the hole, but they refused to let us play through. I guess thats what you get for playing a muni."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,Very nice well manicured course. Course was very busy 1:15 start time. Got stuck behind 2 groups of slow players making for a lot of wait time.
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"We went late on a Saturday morning, so we expected some slow play."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"What we encountered was just way to slow. Some tees we had to wait 5-10 minutes to tee off. We could never get in a rhythm of hitting shots, always hit and wait."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"The back nine there was a single adult playing and on most fairways he let his young son hit. The son did ok, but it still added to the slow pace."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"It's the 2nd time I played, first was on labor day. (expected slow play that day)"
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,The front nine was fairly flat and not a lot of trouble. The greens were pretty flat too. The back nine had a lot more trouble and the greens had a lot more slope
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"Billed as Pete Dye's first 18 hole layout, but don't let that fool you. This is a wide open golf course with small greens, and very little sand or water. The rough is not very penal and the fairways run hard and fast."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"As advertised on every review source, pace of play here is pretty awful. Otherwise decent layout, pretty good condition, enjoyable course for sure. Greens are very true to Pete Dye style. Even someone with a solid short game (unlike me) will have a tough time around and on the greens. I would go back for sure, you just have to manage your expectations and prepare for a 4.5 - 5 hour round. The price is certainly fair for what you get."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"Ever since this course has been taken over by the city of Indianapolis it has gone down hill. The greens are poor and the fairways are the same as the rough just cut a little shorter. The cart paths are in shambles, but it is still a neat course with some challenging holes. Highly recommend for beginners, but there are better courses in the area for the equal price."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,Nice wide open Golf Course located not far from fashion mall
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,They do not break people up enough. It took us 4.5 hours to get through TWELVE holes! That is not okay. Three groups in front of us that were waiting on groups in front of them!
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"They do not adhere to their 15 minutes. They load walk-ins in between scheduled players! Money grab, for sure."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,Will only be playing early AM on this course. Sad.
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"The only draw back I saw was.....there were 2 guys playing in front of us and we had to wait 5 to 10 mins each hole, I kept looking around for the field marshal and didn't see one all day, those. 2 guys didn't care that they held not just us 2 up but the people behind us too. Please work on having someone out there to make sure that people are keeping up with the pace."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,Pace of play was a little slow but other than that I enjoy playing the course
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,Have played here for over 20 years. It was in good shape. Pace of play good. A great course for a beginner.
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"This was not our first time as it says in the review; we never got to the course due to lack of customer service. My husband and I came in on 7/4/2016 to see what was in the golf shop and learn about golf lessons. Matt Nikirk could not have been more rude to us. We got so frustrated that we asked for the manager's contact information. Matt went out of his way to walk into my husband while getting a pen. Seriously, I cannot imagine acting like he did to customers and expect to keep my job. It's such a disappointment to be treated like that."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,For the price coming here is not worth it. Took 5.5 hours for 18. Had to wait for every shot. There are other courses for less that are nicer and pace is faster
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"Easy course, reasonably priced, but even on a weekday at noon or so, the pace of play is horrendous!!"
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,It took us 6 hours to play 18. This is unacceptable. The course needs to do something about pace of play. It should never take that long to play 18. It was one of the most frustrating rounds I have ever played.
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,Great day and course! Greens and fairways were well kept.
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"The fairways weren't top notch but adequate. The greens were typical Pete Dye, double tiered and/or sloping, but also very well maintained. There were some challenges but just ones that you can manage once you have local knowledge. A great course to work on your game."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"This is the course closest to my house, so I play here often and I am really familiar with the course. I always play pretty good out here! The greens are slower than some of the nicer courses but I do not mind that."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,The day was rainy and it was perfect for our round. My 12 yo nephew was playing so with the course not very busy it was the perfect day for him to hit the ball around and have fun. We did have fun and the course was in great condition.
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"I have played Sahm's many times but a long time ago. It was a pleasure to come back and see the course has improved with more cart paths, maintained, added sand traps and more trees.There are some difficult holes and some holes that will help keep your score down.Overall, it was a great experience."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,This is a great course for beginner to intermediate golfers.
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"Great course great condition, just needs better course rangers to keep pace of play up. Other than that really can't beat the price for level of course !"
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"This is a moderately easy course, fairly flat, nice layout, with sloping greens. The fairways and greens where in good shape, except for the 12th green. Cart path needs work. Rough was cut slightly higher then the fairways making it easy to find your ball, and continue play at a good pace. Course was not crowded. Had a lot of single and two person play, allowing us to finish 18 in under 4 hours."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,We had 2 groups playing at just over a 4 hour pace on a Saturday morning. Never felt rushed or pushed.Grass and greens were in good shape.
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,Arrived 30 minutes before tee time and pro obviously doesn't like golf now players.Asked if we could tee off earlier but pro had attitude even though tee was open.Made us wait for exact golf tee time because he wanted to punish golf now users. Never had a problem until sahm.If they don't like golf now players then don't partner with golf now
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"This was our first time playing this course and we really enjoyed it. We had a 3:30 tee time and didn't expect it to be busy, but it actually was to our surprise."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"Rate of play was very slow. Players did not let others play through. No Marshall to help with this. Consesions were cheap and service was friendly but players were terrible. Layout and parking were also very awkward. Course condition was not very good either, like playing in your backyard. Also was not a very challenging course. Very disappointed with the experience."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"Course was easy, greens were slow but rolled okay,Wouldn't pay more than 25 dollars to play"
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,Course was in decent shape and not that difficult - it was the pace of play that ruined the day. Took 5 1/2 hours to play 18. It normally takes us (a couple) 3 to 3 1/2 hours. Seemed like they just let too many people on the course at the same time.
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"I brought a guest and it was awful. It took us 6 hours to play one round, with a ranger who was ""monitoring"" pace of play. When we arrived, they were out of carts, so we had to wait at least 15 minutes for a cart to arrive. Furthermore, the course was in terrible condition. Lesson learned. I will pay the 96$ green fees at prairie view instead. We were just trying to get in a fun, quick round. It was the exact opposite."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"An awesome day with my son, brother and nephew! The course was in great shape and just the degree of difficulty for our sons who are younger and just beginning. Looking for a course that is fairly open and flat, but that is well maintained and fun to play, Sahm is an excellent choice!"
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"always love playing this course. Only problem is parking a good distance away from the proshop. Also on the 10th hole, sometimes it's difficult finding your ball due to balls that flew in from the driving range."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"great price for what you get. course is pretty good, better than what I expected given what I paid."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,Sahm's golf course is probably the best value you can get in north Indy.
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,Great course for the money. A lot of people know this and the course is very busy so the pace of play is slower . But course is in good condition for the amount of play it gets
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"This is a good public course and a good one to play for people who are just starting out. The course is fairly flat and not too long but a good value for the money. I like to play here when I am looking for a 1st time out to get my feet wet again or as a place to play on short notice. The course is generally in good shape but the parking lot is up the road just a bit from the clubhouse in front of the driving range. Best to park, walk to the clubhouse to check in then take a cart to your car to get your clubs. All in all though its a very good value for a public course. I didn't eat or get drinks from the concession stand so I didn't rate the food although from what I remember it was average to good."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"Good value for the money. A few challenging holes, pretty slow play as it was 4:40 to go 18."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"As a beginner, I found this course fairly easy. There weren't a lot of trees, bunkers, or water hazards. As long as you can hit straight, you will be on the fairway. It wasn't busy at all so nobody was pushing you."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"I've played this course numerous times. Staff is very friendly for a metro course. I've never played this course and it not be busy. However, course is very open and not too challenging. Currently, the clubhouse is being renovated."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"Wife and I paired with another twosome as suggested by pro shop. Enjoyed the course, but the pace of play was quite slow. It was a very blustery day, so would like to play it again sometime when all shots were not getting blown around so much."
Sahm Golf Course,554-sahm-golf-course,"Fantastic course. Challenging layout with very well maintained fairways and greens. Probably the nicest public course under $30 in Indy. A must play for any golfer. Very wide open, but unforgiving trees and sandpits off of the fairways. Straight shots set up scoring opportunities on almost every hole."
Otte Golf Center,25453-otte-golf-center,"First time here, friendly staff, nice set up for the price. No complaints."
Otte Golf Center,25453-otte-golf-center,Very fun executive 18 hole golf course. Some short holes and some long holes. Greens a little small but it makes it more fun! Great driving range open all year long. They have heaters over the driving range. Putting and irons practice areas. By yourself you can play this course in a rush in under 1 1/2 hours. Would recommend to someone looking for something fast and fun!
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"The east side of Indy is not a treasure trove of good courses. I think this might be my second favorite after The Fort, but it’s easily the best value. The sprawling layout is what sets it apart from other courses. Rarely are there neighboring fairways. There is more elevation change than most Indy courses. The large greens were in great shape, though a bit shaggy due to the time of year. There were a couple holes with some very unfair pin positions down in dips in the green. White tees were the longest out there, but I assume that’s because it’s mid-November. The golf cart was really struggling…it was painfully slow, and the brake wouldn’t lock. The property has a lot of character. Two bald eagles flew overhead while we were there. Overall it’s a great course, and I will be back."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Winding Ridge was in good shape the day we played. I hadn't played there this year so I was pleasantly surprised as it seemed in better shape and better taken care of compared to last year. I would recommend playing golf there.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"This is a course that you can tell was once great, now showing its age and upkeep challenges. It’s screaming for someone to invest in it .A great long and challenging course layout, just in a lot of disrepair. If you can find it as a hot deal, play it! If you don’t a week day is probably best. It’s however not worth paying full price and in prime time hours, you can find a better course at that price point."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Decent course, especially for the price. Nice pro shop. Staff okay. Fairways very nice, greens are in decent condition. I liked the difficult pin positions. Tee boxes and off fairways not great. Overall it's a decent course foe the price you will pay."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,The course is in great shape. The layout of the course is challenging but rewards good shots. I will play it again.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,The last couple of years this course has been extremely dry and not in the best of condition. With the rain we’ve had so far this year in much better condition.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"My 15 year old son is just starting his golf game and we were pleasantly surprised by the people, the pace of play and the challenging holes with a cluster of par 4s on the back nine made for a fantastic father/son golf day.- Thank you n"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,This course was very challenging. It was fun course to play
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"It was a perfect afternoon, about 65 degrees and hardly any wind. We never had to wait on anyone and no one was pushing us. This is a great layout with fair amount of water. Sand traps were not in great shape and neither are the greens."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Course has been in rough shape for years. $30 is fair. But $40 and above absolutely not. Staff is great though.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Of the many times I’ve played Winding Ridge, do not recall under such windy conditions and yet because of mild temps, it was fascinating and enjoyable. When the wind was at my back had drives that I haven’t had in over 10 years; and when it wasn’t I simply played on. Very memorable day."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Of course when it’s nearing the end of October, it’s like a roll of the dice when it comes to the weather but today the weather was perfect as was Winding Ridge with a good friend. Simply put: A good time that becomes a good memory!"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,I had a great experience golfing at this course! I went after it had rained for a bit and still the course was nice. All the staff was very friendly as well!
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,A joy to play always in good condition friendly staff very professional greens are always in good shape
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"The staff was pleasant and it was not crowded so we were able to tee off before our tee time. Tee boxes were not in good shape and some of the fairways had uneven grass, but the greens were the best I have seen there in a few years. They had just aerated them so putting was slow.. I do enjoy the layout of the course."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Very nice track. Overall was in pretty good shape for this time of year. A few bare spots on greens, but I would not let that deter you from playing as it is a very cool layout. I will be going back!"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,It was fine and just what I expected. Nice staff and great pace of play.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Staff was friendly and helpful.The greens were very spotty and patchy. Would not play again.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Greens are soft and fluffy, worse than putting on carpet. Lot of pitch marks, fixed 3-4 per hole and didn’t leave a dent. Fairways in good shape, price is fair for the area, but for the course it’s a little high. Tee boxes in awful shape, and there are tree branches dropping down into tee shot windows on a couple holes"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,This course has a lot of potential but seems like the owner has given up. Most greens were borderline unplayable and bunkers were pretty much concrete. It has a good setup and some decently challenging holes but not sure how quickly I will be paying to play it again.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Worst conditions of any course I've played this year. Every green but 1 had damage, tee boxes and fairways lacked grass."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"The awful reviews of this course are spot on…GUR on several greens. I understand we haven’t had much rain but this looks like a course that is up for sale, very little maintenance. Came to practice for a tournament next week, they should be embarrassed to host. Aside from the course conditions, no starter on a Saturday morning means your tee time was worthless. Started late, and no ranger meant pace of play was subpar. A few clown holes too…7 is a forced layup which is fine, but the tree in direct line of your second from the fairway is putt putt design. Par 3 eighth hole is short, but trees overgrown on both sides means punching s short iron up the hill. They do have a great Golden Retriever roaming around, but no one seems to pick up his deuces! Just a terrible experience…this course will be a housing development in the near future."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Will be my last time coming to the course. Wow it has gone downhill and fast. Greens were the worst of any course I’ve ever played. Unacceptable, especially for the $45 they charge. Every single green was pretty much unplayable. Never seen anything like it before."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Golf course is in terrible condition, 14 of 18 greens unplayable do to damage. I would suggest finding somewhere else to play."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Some of the worst condition greens I have seen in the northern part of Indianapolis. The roughs were overly long...this is not a US Open Course. Hole placement on the greens was ridiculous unless the course was set up for perhaps a scramble, but not for individual golfers. The greens were abysmally slow and given the hole placement always seemingly unreasonably close to a corner of the green on far too many holes, the round was anything but enjoyable."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,The condition of this course is the worst I have ever played. Big patches of the greens are dead. The fairways are mown weeds and the rough is a hay field. The tee boxes are mostly dirt now as well. How a course could get in this bad a shape is beyond me. This course either needs to be closed and rebuilt or plowed under to make room for more houses. In other words if your choice is play here or don’t play…then don’t play. Your local driving range is in better shape.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Conditions were ideal. Golf with a friend from Chicago. No wait. Price was great! Pace of play was good. Finished 18 in less than 4 hrs. Always find hole 18 tough.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Overall for $25 it was a great deal for this course. However, I don’t know that I would pay full price with the condition that it is in currently. Very thick roughs with heavy grass clippings, and some greens were in poor condition/damaged with what appeared to be mold growth or disease."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Although the people in the clubhouse were nice, and the clubhouse facilities were nice, I have never seen a course in worse condition. The fairways were atrocious, and as much a hazard is anything else, The rough was unplayable, and the bball was difficult to find slowing rhe 9 hole pace to 3 hours! The sand traps were horrid, and most of them filled with water. The greens were unforgettable, shaggy long, slow, differing speeds in different areas and about a third of all the green surfaces was gone due to some sort of problem with I don’t know what. I will never play that course again, and I would never recommend it to a friend."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"I got a last-minute hot deal to play this course. Compared to last summer, It is in good condition but some greens and fairways are still very patchy with what appears to be some sort of disease. The roughs were very rough with way too much grass clippings from recent mowing and still too high for an average course, with little or no transition from the fairway to heavy rough..it was difficult to find your ball even when it was right in front of you and only 2’-3’ off fairway! Overall the greens, fairways and tee boxes weren’t too bad for the price paid ($24/18 holes) but this course still needs attention."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"This course continues to outdo itself year after year with some of the worst fairways in the city. In addition to fairway shape, several diseased greens in very bad shape across course. The management company has pretty much given up at this point…."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,I used to love playing here but now it’s just a cow pasture. One of the worst courses I’ve ever played condition-wise. Really bad shape. Greens are terrible. It’s unfortunate because the layout has potential and it used to be in a lot better shape.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"This would be a nice municipal course if they could just get the greens in shape. The layout is nice, lots of different types of holes with and without water. Just wish the greens were in better shape."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Greens were dead/burnt/covered in weeds. Conditions were bad last year and have not improved since. No warning or mention of how poor conditions the course is in. Much better golf for same price in surrounding area.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,This course continues to get worse every time I play it. Must be why I only play it a couple time a year hoping it will improve.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Some green had dead spot do to who knows. Overall this course in bad shape and need a great deal of attention.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"The course needs a lot of work, the fairways were in bad shape as well as the greens.That area of Marion County had a lot rain, I’m sure the course will be up to par by mid season."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Staff was very friendly and accommodating. Driving range used floating golf balls. Irons only. Pace was a little slow, but that was directly related to the VERY windy conditions. Greens had blotchy spots, making it tough to putt. Would recommend to friends when greens are healed."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,It appears the course has not recovered from last year’s turf issues. For the higher green fees I would expect better course maintenance.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Multiple greens had damage to the greens from last year, tee boxes need work, and there isn't a range here. I would come back to check it out during the summer to see if it improves, but they have a lot of work to do until I would."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Not enough carts for tee times scheduled, forced to play as a foursome. Paid for 18, was only able to play 9 due to pace of play."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Green and Fairway are in horrible condition, green is all beat up. It was the worse condition I have seen."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"14 of 18 greens totally unplayable, DO NOT PLAY!!!"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Third or fourth time playing here. Used to love it here, but conditions and upkeep has really diminished. Poor markers around sand trips to indicate, unkept tee boxes, and the greens are atrocious! Due to all the black tar/cracked conditions on the green, the pin locations are right up front or in random valleys between two hills on the green. Some placements felt like putt putt trick hole courses. Disappointed how much this place has been neglected"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Extremely rude owner and the course is not well maintained. Busted sprinkler heads all over the course horrible design idea for driving range. Used to be good under different management but really horrible last time there
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,The course was burnt out with t-boxes and greens in horrible shape. Unfortunately wouldn’t recommend till course comes around. Staff was great…course in bad shape.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Coarse was in bad shape fairways and greens were dead in many spots and tee boxes had no grass just dirt to hit off of.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"To be honest. This is arguably the worst conditions I have ever seen. Ever green has burn spots/disease spots that are about 10’x10’, tee boxes are just straight sand - no grass, fair ways are mostly weeds. Could be such a beatiful course due to the layout and mature trees but the entire course needs to be ripped up and new sod laid."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Great course conditions for August. Very beautiful course in excellent condition and a lot of fun to play. Many challenging holes.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,The course layout was really good. But large portions of fairways have no grass because no sprinklers. Greens were really good. With the rain we have had the bald areas and all the sand traps were unplayable. Club house staff could not have been friendlier.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Overall, this would rank as one of my favorite public courses around Indianapolis. Challenging holes in a lot of different ways, not always length. Thin fairways, hitting over water, bunkers, etc. Course seemed quite challenging and then ended with 4-5 scoring holes which made for a very fun finish. Only big downside is there is a lot of dead grass on the greens, but the pin locations made it so it didn’t affect play much."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Course was in terrific shape greens were just perfect but could be faster but I’m not complaining. Fairways were in good shape too!
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Although the weather conditions were not favorable on the day that I played, it was windy and very wet, I thought the course was in great shape. It has been a few years since I have played there, so I forgot how challenging the Par 3's could be and the blind shots that exist, especially hole 7!"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Coming from Ohio, this was worth my drive and worth a round or 2!"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Great course, I recommend playing this challenging course."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,The greens and fairways were in dire need of repair. Perhaps they had a tough summer? So many bare patches and spots with no grass on the greens.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Aside from the bare patches and massive amounts of unpatched divots, the layout of the course is fantastic! A ton of well-placed bunkers, water hazards, and other obstacles definitely made it challenging. A few short par 4s made it tempting to try and squeeze an extra 50 yrs out of my driver."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,I won’t likely play again there this year; hopefully their groundskeepers can get things back in shape for next season.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"I love the layout, but the course condition was not good. I play here at least 2-4 times a year and the back nine was bad overall … tee boxes, greens and fairways. Front nine was alittle better."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,The carts did not look clean… 2 still had garbage in them.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Staff was very friendly and very helpful when we had carts issues.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Tee boxes and greens are in poor shape. Course is overgrown with weeds.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Showed up to find a course closed sign. Had a prepaid reservation. Ridiculous
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"There is zero attempt at investing in course maintenance here. I don’t think there is one area of conditions that meets acceptable for a golf course, really at any price. It’s pathetic how content rn Thompson courses are with this and I will never play at another one again. They have some nice layouts that were good in the 90s and 2000s that have fallen into goat ranch status."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Wife and I had a great date playing a round here… her first time ever playing. Course was in great shape considering the prior week of non-stop rain (most bunkers were full of water but not much could’ve been done about that). The pace of play couldn’t have been better with it being her first time - we never saw anyone in front of us the entire time and only waited briefly to let a single ahead of us on the 11th. Staff was great all around from start to finish, especially the bartender and the lady that answered the phone when I called earlier in the day to ask a question about my wife not having her own clubs (which by the way, she was allowed to use mine). We’ll be back!"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Ok course, layout can be difficult from back tees. Course maintenance just average. Most traps unplayable and course kept extremely wet to prevent from drying out. Decent value on Hot Deal from golfnow."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Course is awesome, it's in great shape. Great price for 18 holes of golf. New carts!! Staff is very friendly and are glad you're there. The course is challenging but lots of fun. I play there often with my bff's."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"The staff is very unfriendly. We went to check in and didn't even get greeted. Our foursome played in 5 1/2 hours. If you weren't in the fairway, the course is like a goat ranch. When returning the carts at the end of our round, the staff were rude and pushy. You could tell they wanted to go home and we were holding them up. I've played many different golf courses in Indianapolis and other cities across the country and this was by far the worst customer experience ever."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Love ❤️ this course and will play again soon! Nice greens! Awesome staff and very clean. Pro very welcoming and enjoyed the food service and the great choices! Highly recommend this course to all golfers!! ⛳️♥️
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"I don't know why guy gave bad review, wonderful course, well managed. Staff very friendly. New carts, course in great condition. Somebody must not have played well and it is not the course's fault or staff. I will play there again!!! You should play golf there too! See you on the links."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"In the past, I’ve played this course around 10-15 times a year. This year, I won’t. The greens need a lot of work. I’ve bought the pass for the year, but I’ll just have to play the other courses until Winding Ridge gets ahold of their greens. There are several greens that are splotchy with dead grass. To me, the greens are what helps you score.. you can drive the ball great, and chip wonderful, but if don’t have a smooth green to putt on, it’s a ruined game."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,My overall rating of this course if positive with some nuances.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Pros: good layout, diverse holes, plenty of “decision shots” of playing aggressive or laying up, challenging, very friendly staff, pace of play (minus the miserably slow two some in front of us but that’s not the courses fault)."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Cons: bunkers were not great (not that any of us hit it there right?), crab grass and sod on a few greens, several tee boxes needed some work, maybe too challenging? (for the mid 90s golfers out there), and the DREADED “deep rough”."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"A lot of holes and between fairway areas had a “deep rough” that was thick, unmowed grass. Even if your shot wasn’t terribly off the fairway line, it is likely to be lost or a 10 minute search if/when it lands there. This led to many lost balls that should have 100% been in play and understandably, more strokes for penalties."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Overall, it was a very visually appealing, diverse, and challenging course. Prepare to lose a few more balls than you’re accustomed to due to lots of water and the deep rough. Had to move a few putts to avoid dirt/ crab grass while kn greens. Staff couldn’t have been nicer though."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Don’t waste your money! Course layout was great this course has potential but not until they get better at upkeep.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Had a great time and will be returning for sure!!!
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Really interesting layout. Tons of water, some really tough, long holes. Few trees in play, but those that are make straight shots a premium. Played in mid-Dec., so not expecting pristine greens, but overall course was in good shape. Really fiun terrain, with huge distances in between holes."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Showed up for our tee time and the man at the counter was on the phone. Kept talking while we stood to check-in and wasn’t even talking to a customer by what I heard of the conversation. When he finally got off the phone, he offered no apology. It was amazing how rude he was."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"We finally get on the course and it is in appalling condition. Greens that are torn up, fairways that would be rough anywhere else. Tee boxes that are torn to shreds and not even level. All in all it was abysmal."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"The only nice thing are the carts, they offered a comfortable tour of this atrocity."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Interesting layout, has some challenges but also rather forgiving if you make a bad shot, greens were soft and fairways were in Very good condition. The majority of the homes had a pretty good distance from greens to the next tee box so walking would take a bit longer, recommend a cart. Would play again!"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"All kinds of shot making decisions are required, depends on how aggressive you want to be.It has uphill,downhill,doglegs,ponds to avoid,short holes,long holes ,no flat greens and it has sand.Price is always reasonable with course conditions very good most of the time.The guys I play with do not like it ( all in the 70’s ) because it is too hard.It is not ,they just need to play better.I love it.Thanks"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Used the hot deal to play 18 with a cart for $23 at 11:10AM. You really can’t beat that! I usually shoot around a 96. While this course had a handful of short, easy holes, most of them were pretty challenging for someone like me. I really enjoyed it! Sure, there’s some crab grass on the boxes and some dead spots on the green but for the money I paid I’d happily play here again."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Quite likely the worst-maintained course in Indianapolis.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Can’t expect a ton when you pay $28 for 18 with a card on a beautiful Friday afternoon in September. Course is showing a lot of wear after a long summer of play. Greens are completely baked or dead in some areas, tee boxes either looked like the driving range or needed to be mowed badly, and fairways were alright but in some areas it was tough to distinguish between rough and the short stuff. Overall not bad for the price, but not the best round I’ve played in the past few weeks by far."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"I can imagine there are many courses that don’t have ranges. For me, that’s a problem. I play better once I have warmed up and synced my tempo for the round. Hitting clubs cold sucks. Or going through three or four holes and swinging the big stick for the very first time. Pace of play was a bit too slow. But that’s just the average golfers normal. Course had some area that were pitiful. But on par with the price I thought which was reasonable. We walked the course and it’s about 7.5 miles from the blue tees depending on your accuracy. But it’s golf. So it was fun to play. Try it"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Each hole had its own challenges and I liked the variety. It was a great price for 18 holes and it took us roughly 4 1/2 hours to finish. We're not pro golfers by any stretch so I'm sure a better golfer could finish it much more quickly! I'll definitely go again.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Perfect course for beginner golfer or intermediate players. Pace of play is what you’d expect for weekend afternoon golf. An enjoyable day on the links.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Staff was friendly and course offers enough challenge for the average golfer.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Was told that after only playing 6 holes that I couldn't get a rain check. Huh? This is one of them good ol boys network here. Never felt welcoming. Especially since my companion was Caucasian. Never again even if it was free of charge.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,If you’re a single: they make you ride with someone if they have the same tee time.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Went golfing and it started storming unexpectedly. Booked through golf now and was told to ask for a refund through them. Owner refused to refund saying they only issue rain checks. Nightmare experience will never go back
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"And not just for the value! Full 18 holes, links style with some water in just the right places. Challenging enough for novice players, but not so much you can’t enjoy it. And a few holes with perfect placement of bunkers and water to make you question, “Should I go for it?” Definitely coming back..."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"I first played this course back in 2010, I continue to enjoy myself every time I visit. I am an RN Thompson Golf Group Platinum Multi-Course Member."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Played eighteen holes by Terry Schill.The wind was howling!!!!Listed as 23 mph but gusting to at least 40. A dollar bill flew past me on number 12 so fast I couldn't catch it.Terry Schill drove the short par four number sixteen ant three putted!!This course is very fun. Bring your friends and expect to have a good time. Be careful playing the white tees at 6,054 yards they play longer. Fair warning."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Wonderful golf course. Friendly staff very aware of the virus. Great layout and pace of play. Terry a Schill recommends the course and the staff.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,It's all around a great course! It was super wet grounds out today but the ball still had some bounce and the greens were nice! It's a bit of a challenging course for a beginner but definitley one I'll go back to very soon!
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,A very good challenge - short holes - long holes - holes with risk / rewards / slanted greens / undulating greensA great course !
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,What a great opportunity to play golf in Indiana in December. Normally I am in Florida or Hawaii this time of year but decided to stay close for the holidays and family. Nabbed a tee time on golf now and tried Winding Ridge. I was paired with a local gentleman named Terry Schill. We played the ball down and despite cart path only rules we finished in under four hours. The course is definitely a challenge with beautiful rolling hills and lots of water to keep you aware of where you want to bit the ball. Well placed sand traps and visually perfect sightlines es. Highly recommend this value priced course.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"I play here twice a week when I can. The course is challenging but manageable for most skill levels. Nice fairways and greens, some of which are pretty curvy. Many opportunities for your ball to end up wet - water can be found on 15 of the 18 holes. Staff is friendly and helpful. Look forward to getting back there."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"I have played this many since it open. Many improvements to the course have been made. This year seems to be the best since I have been playing, as far as improvements go. Keep up the great work look forward to another round."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Enjoyed playing there as always!! Pleasant staff. Only thing missing was the carts that have the map course and computerized tracker from hole to hole. Love playing when the carts have them. I will still continue to play. I like the length of this course as it gives you lots of par 4 and 5’s.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"I hadn't played this course in years and thought I would give it a try. Big mistake! I had secured a tee time through GolfNow and checked in early. The staff person couldn't find my tee time until I showed it to him on my cell phone. He said, ""Oh yeah, you're with the ____group and they don't tee off for another 40 minutes."" I told him I knew I was early but was hoping I could get off since there wasn't anyone around (it had just finished raining). He said I couldn't do that because I had to share a cart. I asked him why and he said since I used GolfNow, I had only purchased one seat in a cart. I acknowledged that a cart does indeed have one seat. He said, ""yeah, but you only purchased half of that seat"". I told him that I use GoldfNow exclusively and I had NEVER been denied a cart. He then said, ""that isn't true."" I asked him if he was calling me a liar, at which time he chose to shut up. I went on with the round only because it was too late to cancel, but I will NEVER go back there. Oh yeah, it was 86% humidity that day and no water to drink on the course."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Course in great shape if you stay straight.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Second cut and mounds pretty dry if you have a tendency to stray off the fairways or greens.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Lovely day on a nice course!
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"The weather was great and the course was in above to excellent shape. A couple of fairways were wet and spongey but it really didn’t affect our play. It had rained in days so not sure why it was wet in those areas. There were several holes that were very well laid out. Our favorite was an elevated fairway with a blind shot to the green from most likely over 150 yards out. The course wasn’t too difficult overall which helped end in a decent score.Our only complaint was the food service. The lady there was prepping food with bare hands while taking money from customers without washing. I ordered a hot dog that was re-heated in the micro until it split open. Yuk. The chicken salad sandwich was huge and really had too much filling. There was no way you could expect to take this sandwich to go and eat while hading out to play the back. I took two bites from my daughters since the hot dog was a struggle to get down. I had to go wash my hands after trying to hold the sandwich together as it was so heavy and wet from too much chicken salad. So, all in all, I probably would have gave it a higher ranking if the hygiene was up to standard. If we were very hungry I probably would have passed up on the food."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Great course for the money! Would recommend to anyone!
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"This course is tucked away on the far east side of town, fun layout and nice condition. For the price to play and the course conditions it’s a great deal."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Staff member seemed to have an attitude about use ofGroupGolfer vouchers. One of my group had to payfull price because staff told him his voucher had alreadybeen used. After our round, he inquired with GroupGolfer and found out his voucher number was entered twice,making his voucher invalid. His $18 was credited to hisaccount. We play often, and use GroupGolfer voucherswhen we can. We like this course, but the fellow letshis feelings about the vouchers show. I recommend the course and will play there again."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Only thing they are missing is a true driving range. Nice course in a crap neighborhood.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"I worked at this course 15 years ago when it opened it was run by RN Thompson and his team and maintained by superintendent Michael Jordan. John, David and Karen Scott where the management team and they're still there today maintaining what is really the best value in golf around the Indianapolis metro area."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Played this course today. It’s october. Cold okay? It was cold. Had a frost delay. I understand because it’s cold. I was the only guy playing. First one all day and wow was it worth it being cold. Beautiful course. I have a natural “draw” so the water was never an issue for me. The carts are so comfortable they make nearly touching 100 an absolute pleasure. Amazing fairways. Was nice to hit off of them twice. Rough was great. Either there weren’t many trees letting go of their leaves or the staff does a great cleanup job which is appreciated this time of year. Great time and great course. Play it!!!
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"I’ve always been frustrated playing Winding Ridge. It’s a course I feel has the potential to be great, but too often I feel like it’s poorly maintained and pace of play is usually a nightmare.Today was different, the course was in fairly good condition, though the fairways all looked a little too thick. And perhaps b/c it was just my friend and I playing, we finished in a tidy 3 1/2 hrs. That’s easily 1 1/2 hrs less than it usually takes to finish 18."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"I really like this course. Just sucked I got stuck behind a 4 some playing really slow and they wouldn’t let me play thru. Nothing bad to say about the course though. Just happened to run into so bad, slow players."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,This course may appear easier then it seems. Tough pin positions make a good drive with an accurate lay up essential to get off a hole with a good score. Greens and fairways are well maintained with great tee boxes to challenge any level golfer. Overall a fun course where the holes do not run next to each other.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,This was third time playing this course this year.They have good specials on GroupGolfer.Have played here since they opened in latenineties. Course is in good shape and hasmatured well. I have introduced many ofmy golf friends to this course over the years.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Everything about my round was better than acceptable - except that there was no water on the course - and the temp reached 90
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Have played Winding Ridge for a number of years. It is a fairly long course with water on all but two holes. Yesterday was a windy day so it made the course even more difficult. I find after playing WR I play other curse much better as I find them easier to play. The ground keeping staff has done an exceptional job in keeping the course. The fairways are green and well kept. The greens are perfect. They hold your shot, so go for the pin. Dave, the pro, is always personable as well as the staff."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Maybe not a perfect course, but sure is s value for the money! Well manicured and maintained bent grass greens and fairways for a very fair price. Almost new and well maintained golf carts. Enough challenge yet not overly inundated with hazards. All in all a bargain for the average golfer, but still challenging enough for the avid one."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Course was unkempt, signs st tee's not painted and their usual professional look. The season is early but they usually have better grounds and weeding done"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"The course was in good shape overall. There were a few holes on the front and back that could use some work...mainly the fairways. The greens seem to be in pretty good condition overall. The course layout isn't my favorite, but it was only $35 on a weekend during peak hours...so I really can't complain. I played as a single, and didn't wait on a single hole..played in less than 4 hours."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"The course layout was tough, but fair. The greens are very challenging with a lot of undulations. The fairways were in good shape, but the roughs were covered with dandelions and were unsightly. Getting rid of the dandelions would make the course really attractive to play."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"The course can be challenging. There is water on all but two of the holes. It is also long. I find that after playing Winding Ridge that I play other courses much better. Playing this course has really improved my game. The staff is always friendly. The course is well maintained. The fairways and greens are always nice. Would highly recommend playing Winding Ridge, you will enjoy it."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Just a very nice public course at a very reasonable cost. Plenty of hazards but not terribly difficult. Course is well sintained except sand traps are marginal. New carts are well maintained.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"The course is in decent shape for the rough winter, though as a previous review suggested, it has the hallmarks of limited care that the ownership group is known for - I.E. muddy bunkers, spotty fairways, patchy greens in spots. It's early in the year to be fair, but those sorts of problems are found in season at others owned by this group that I have played (Gray Eagle, Southern Dunes, Ironwood)."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"I did enjoy the layout though. It has its share of character. There are houses but they are far enough off that it would take a bad hook/slice to hit one. The number of ponds that were there and were in play surprised me, honestly. More than usually found on public courses in this area. Lots of knobs in the rough lining the fairway and greens. I enjoyed the 6-8 stretch of the course the most. 6 was a par 5 with 3 ponds in play on the left, 7 was lay-up tee shot and blind second par 4, and 8 was a neat little uphill par 3 in the trees. The course does do something I do not like by closing with a 260 par 4 (from the whites), 300 par 4, and risk/reward par 5 ~450ish from 16-18. I can foresee this being very backed up when it's busy."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"But if you can find a deal for the course it's well worth a go. It ranks up with the others in the price range, like Gray Eagle or Fox Prairie or Pebble Brook. Say hi to the friendly dog that greets you at the clubhouse too!"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,My home course. Fairways and greens are well maintained. Sand is typical public course type. Good layout providing average challenging ponds and mounds to contend with. Easy to navigate. Staff is friendly. Generally easy to get a tee time. New carts 2017. Well worth the fee.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,course was a good challenge but the greens were in bad shape
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Courses run by this group across the city are similar, thin fairways with not much grass and beat up, slow greens. The layout here is long and challenging, just the conditions of the course were not as nice as other options in the city. When you can get a good deal through Golf Now, I don't mind playing, but this course is never my first choice."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Took 3 1/2hrs to play 11 holes. Terrible pace of play. Too many tee times. Great course for the money.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Good course layout, all around a good course, hills on the edges of the fairways makes for tough shots if your not in the fairway. Not sure if the AC was broke in the clubhouse or they were saving money. Good value. 25.00 hot deal"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"This course has continued to grow up, we enjoy playing here and the water hazards pose just enough hazard to maintain your attention throughout the round. Even though it rained the day before the course held up to our travels on the golf cart. Check it out and I'm sure you'll enjoy the track as we do."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,The staff always has an attitude problem . It seems that they don't take to kindly to golfers using the hot deals.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Really nice course in great condition, friendly staff."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"This is a solid course. Nothing too fancy, but the fairways and greens were in very good condition. Probably the best value course I have played this year."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,I'm from Arizona and my son suggested the course. I loved it. The fairways and greens are in fabulous shape. It's simply a fun course to play. Nice clubhouse with a friendly staff and a small cozy bar. Tables outside to sit while sipping and enjoy the view. I'll look forward to coming back. Made my res through Golf Now and the rate was very very reasonable.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"This was my first time out on this course. It has a fun, playable layout that can be challenging. It's worth driving up the hole to see what's ahead of you on a shot if you aren't sure what lies ahead. There are plenty of hazards that are in play and taking a look ahead will help give you a safe target."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"The greens were the only thing I had issue with. They were slow and a little shaggy which, for me, is always a little disappointing. The green complexes themselves were undulating and presented a good challenge. I can imagine that quicker green speeds would limit where holes can be set but I still prefer faster greens than we saw."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Overall, the value for what we paid was worth it and we'd probably play again for the same price($26 for 8AM on a Sunday)."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"this is a pretty decent course, nice layout, moderately well cared for, but it is lacking in just a few areas.first there is no driving range so come warmed up. the greens were inconsistent but were not horrible. they just bounced between fast and slow from hole to hole. not an overly penal course although there are some really blind danger areas (down the left on #2 and #8 is cray cray- you have to play through a chute of trees to the green)"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"I like to play Winding Ridge with my adult daughter who is picking up the game. 5 or 6 tees (tee boxes could really be better cared for). Low tree count, wide fairways, some water but only a couple where you have to carry the hazard. This course gives me a chance to work on some things, while it is not overly frustrating to a newer golfer. Last two times I have played there, the golf cart has given out on the back nine requiring a phone call to the clubhouse and a cart switch."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"This course could be great. Unfortunately it is poorly cared for. The greens are terrible. Slowest greens I have ever played on and 10 is just stupid. The fairways are mowed, that's pretty much the best I can say about them. The ranger gave us Gerig because we parked the carts too close to the green. We were at least 20 yards away from the green."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,The course was in pretty good shape. It was quick moving with no one in front or behind us.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Third time playing this track. Its a great layout, and probably one of my favorites in Indy, however I will have trouble taking a foursome back there again. Every tee box was filled with dandelions, the first cut was so thick that it swallowed up golf balls, and most of the greens had a condition that made them spotty and bumpy. Play at your own risk."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Had a good time, course was in good condition, pace of play was not too slow for a weekend."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Very nice course. Challenging but fun. Very good value for the money. You need to try it.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"I have to say I really was caught off guard by this course.. It has a nice look at the club house, the course is maintained enough. The only down side is some of the greens have patches of moss growing on them.. Other then that I'll be going back many more timrs"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Tough in windy conditions. Back 9 greens are a real test for high handicap golfer. Overall a good course in very good condition.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Enjoyed the cours layout. Weak finishing holes were disappointing. Course was in decent shape.Few greens had fungus growing in them
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,The course was good condition. Greens and fairways were good. It was raining the day we played so it took away from the total enjoyment.Over all it was a good course to play. I would definitely play it again.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Winding Ridge is always one of my favorite courses in Marion County to play. The course is in relatively good shape although some greens were torn up (fix your ball marks please!) pace of play can sometimes be a problem especially on the back 9 because there are some drivable par 4s. But overall the value is great staff is friendly and the course is challenging and fun.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Played on s Sunday, weather was perfect and the course was in pretty good shape. They left time around tee times so we were able to move pretty quick. Played 18 in just over 3 hours."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"the course is in good shape, the guy at the counter always seems to be bothered by golf now tee times.After finishing the front nine I found out that they had let a girls high school team (16 players) off the back. Not wanting to wait or play thru 4 groups I ended my round. I understand the team has to play but why on the back in front of groups making the turn? Very disappointed at the way those are managed and not communicated before the round."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,played behind some travelling league they were very slow would not let people by them made for a long drawn out day that took all enjoyment out of our round I think management should have a course marshall to make sure pace of play is kept to a better standard the course was in great shape should have been an enjoyable day but it was far from enjoable
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Good golf course greens are medium speed with lots of undulations. Pretty well kept a few interesting holes. Only complaint would be how soft the greens were but we had rain and 70 degree weather for a week so I'm guessing that's why. Shot 73 and putted well but to make putts you need to be below most of these holes.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Nice fairways, greens. Played in league about 8 years ago on Fridays, glad they got rid of the heather on the mounds in some fairways. Makes course more enjoyable to play. Shot +1 on front, -1 on back.......Great day!!! Will be back! Some tough pin placements, but that's why it's a challenge!!"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Reserved (and paid for) round using iPhone app. On arrival, was told that I needed a printed voucher to prove I had paid. Had to eventually get manager involved. If they're going to use online apps to reserve rounds, they need to figure it out."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Also, took 10 minutes to get a hotdog and bottled water, then was asked if I wanted to add a tip. Really?!?"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Played on a Wednesday at 1:30p. Saw no one else within three holes of me all day. Finished 18 in just over 2 1/2 hours. This is a well maintained course that is priced well. The first hole could be groomed more to ""show"" better, but the aesthetics of the course improve greatly from there."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Course was in Great Shape. The wind was strong and made the course play long. Pace of play was under 4 hours for a two some. Staff was friendly and let us go off early. The lady at Concession was the best, Great service with a smile. Ice Tea really Good."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,I've played this course a handful of times. I usually can shoot pretty well her and since it's not too far out on the east side of the city and if there's a deal for around $30 it's worth the trip. At first the course doesn't appear very challenging but you quickly realize that if you're off of the fairway and on the mounds that line the fairway it can be difficult to recover. Many holes though are straight forward and offer plenty of fairway. Perhaps my biggest complaint with this course is that the surrounding area is just still being developed. The course winds through a community of newer generic homes and there are few if any trees to provide some separation from these homes and the fairway. The back nine goes into another part of the community where homes are still being built. It basically amounts to a construction site. Hopefully as the course matures this becomes less and less of an issue.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,First time playing at Winding Ridge. The course was kept in very good shape. Not crowded at all on a Sunday early afternoon. Some narrow fairways made it a good challenge.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"We were impressed with the greens. It had rained 3 days straight before we played and the greens rolled so good. Of course it was wet in spots, but the course is in great shape. Staff was very friendly."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Played a quick round on Sunday morning. This course had some quirky holes on it. #7 borders on the side of comical. Cut that tree out and it would be a great hole. Overall a great experience.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Course has been in better condition the past few years than currently.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,I've played this course several times based on location and price. It can get pretty chewed up through out the year due to upkeep and play. Overall it has some fun holes and if you can play for $20-$25 it is well worth it. Just go in expecting that some of the greens and fairways will have some bad spots. Luckily I played early spring and it was probably best shape I've seen it.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"I like this course. It's never in the best condition but it's cheap and the holes are challenging. The white and black tees are spread out far enough so, as a senior, I'm not temped to try to keep up with the long hitters in my group. Players I've met have always been friendly. The staff is crothchety but in a good way. They treat everyone bad so you don't feel isolated."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,I enjoy this course and there are some challenging holes. My only problem is the distance you have to park your cart from the greens. It really makes more sense to just walk the course.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,The course itself is good and challenging for a beginner. It does get backed up and we were waiting at almost every tee.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Course needs a lot of attention, when on the course there were three carts that i saw died out, on the 17th hole my friends cart died. Would I recommend this course no!"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"This is a fun course to play, but be prepared to lose strokes on the greens. They have some ridges and contours that are nearly impossible and because the greens are so dry, the ball doesn't hold. They should water them down more. The marshalls are young kids and have no clue about customer service and some of the foursomes don't get golf etiquette. They don't play ready golf. Overall we enjoyed the course and will be back!"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"We played this course on a Saturday mid day with possibly 25 cars in the parking lot...so not especially crowded. We found the course to be in great shape and a great value for the $30 weekend rate we were charged. We were a twosome followed by another twosome and then two foursomes. I only mention this because after three hours on the front nine, we stopped in the clubhouse and over heard the foursome playing in front of us mention to the staff that there was a problem with the slow playing foursome in front of them. I didn't here the reply. At the 13th hole, the slow playing foursome was just reaching the green. The foursome in front of us were in the fairway, we and the other two foursomes were waiting on the tee [ the twosome behind us had already given up on the 11th hole and went home]. We were at 5 hours at that point. We and one of the foursomes skipped to hole 14 and saw that there were 4 holes empty . SLOW PLAY with no marshal or member of the staff to take the time to see how their course was doing on a weekend. The 10 people i talked to will never come back to the course. Overall, the course was very good but we will never play there again either. What a shame."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Challenging course. Well maintained. Definitely worth the money!
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"greens need mowed shorter/ slower than slow, sprinklers on in places that don't need to be watered. rough is like playing on the moon (rock hard). Sad that course has come to this state. Used to be very nice 2 or 3 years ago."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,It was a hot day... 95 degrees... and the course was moist in some areas... but on whole the course was baked... if you miss the fairway who knows where the ball will go... if it hits hardpan you might as well be playing on the parking lot.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,And i'm thinking there must have been a tournament over the weekend because the pin placements were some of the toughest i've seen.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,The greens on the course are very challenging. Probably one one the most challenging greens in Indiana.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,This used to be a course that was kept in good condition. The fairways are very spotty and the greens are filled with ball marks. The staff act like they would rather be somewhere else. There are too many courses around to play a course like this.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"I got behind a fivesome and they were fairly slow to hit the ball, which made for a longer than average day"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"I've played the course many times before. It's been a while, but I had a great time playing and running into friends whom I shared Golf Now with."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Good shape dry in some areas, weather.Has tricky hole locations which makes it fun"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Course plays through a neighborhood which can be noisy and distracting. Numerous unrepaired ball marks on the greens. Lack of signage makes navigating between holes a chore. Tee boxes were in rough shape but the fairways were good.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Had to follow a small scramble outing which made it a bit slow at times. A lot of the bunkers were a bit muddy and the greens were a bit slower than I prefer but overall the course was in great shape.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,The course was in decent shape. I was able to be the first on the course. The greens had a few ball marks that people neglected to repair.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"The par 5 are definitely long. A course that is a little difficult for a beginner, but all in all a good course for the money."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,This is a legit golf course for anyone as long as you play the correct tees. it's very tough from the tips. The areas where you shouldn't hit your ball are still really sparse and there isn't much grass at all. Don't hit your ball there...right? Nice layout and mix of long and short holes. I'll be going back.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"This course requires you to hit straight, with rolling mounds on one side water on some holes the other. It was a great day"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Some greens had many divots that should have been repaired by players. One of two fairways had a spot that was damaged by carts, again player faults. Otherwise great course and had a blast! Will be returning very soon!"
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Course set-up/layout is very nice, but the conditions of the fairways and greens left A LOT to be desired. It appears as if they simply ""bit off more than they can chew"" to keep up with maintenance."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,walked in and right on to the course and had a wonderful day on the course
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Nice people, nice layout but greens were slowest I've played in a long time. They may have left them long on purpose from a recent application or dry conditions in an attempt to keep greens green, but putting wasn't fun. Other than that, I had a good time. Accommodating staff."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Mowing of rough left great amount of cuttings on top-making finding balls very difficult. Fairways and tee boxes were in pretty good shape. Greens were mostly good, couple were in adequate condition. Slow play was apparently tolerated- no rangers to be seen. Ball washers lacking on back nine."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,Greens were in good shape but seemed a bit slow. Maybe due to heavy rains but several fairways needed work both by mowing and filling in some bare ground
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"The course looks nice from a distance, but closer examination reveals a host of issues. The fairways have large areas of dead spots as do the greens. The flags were positioned to reduce the impact of the dead spots in the green, but this is a poor solution. The water hazards are sometimes oddly placed, like holes 6 and 7, and poorly marked. There are large power lines clouding the views on the front 9."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,My cart stopped functioning properly on the 3rd hole and the staff was rather indifferent. I managed to nurse it through the from 9 and then change carts at the turn.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,The rough is spotty and there was a load of grass clippings to deal with.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"If you are looking to play nine, the back is a much better play than the front."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,The course was very wet without rain in the previous couple of days. It appears they are overwatering. The rough was covered in grass clippings making it very difficult to find balls only a few yards off of the fairway which slows play.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,The greens were in pretty good shape with only a few damaged areas.
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"At the start of last year, this was a pretty decent course for the money. By the summer time the drought was starting to take it's toll. By the end of the year, it was a disaster as they really struggle with maintenance. The things I see, I can't use drought as an excuse. If you want to play this, you should consider playing it soon as the condition is likely to get worse over the coming months. Overall, it is a good test of all your shots. Good mix of average and long holes with some risk reward opportunities. The greens need some of the big mounds taken out so that they can keep the grass alive (if they water them it just runs off the mounds causing complete burnout). Hole #7 could be so much better. Why is the biggest tree on the course right where you need to hit your tee shot blocking any approach to the green? Dumb. Cut it down and it would be a very cool hole as you would be hitting your second shot from a high elevation to a lower green."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Course is nice, However, the rough was extremely tall. There was also mounds and mounds of grass trimmings which made it close to impossible to find your golf ball if you were in the rough. for 20 dollars you can't go wrong though."
Winding Ridge Golf Club,28993-winding-ridge-golf-club,"Great staff, course in very good condition. Yardage markers on every hole make it much easier to select correct club. Greens run true."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"This was my first time playing this course and I want to start off by saying the staff was AWESOME, super helpful and friendly. The course is a fun and challenging course, it was in pretty good shape considering we haven’t had rain in a month!! Don’t hit it in the bunkers or you’re gonna hate life lol I loved playing the links style course because even when I hit an errant tee shot I still could find the ball and have a shot. Looking forward to playing again soon."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Surprisingly great course design. Beautiful setting, mature trees, tall grass, water shape. Fairways and greens were in very good condition. It seemed like 20 years ago this was one of the best courses in the region. However, it shows lack of investment and/or revenue as the amazing sand traps desperately need sand and maintenance. Greens were in good shape just needed cut as they were very slow for this level of course layout and multi tiered green surfaces. In short, this course would be fantastic with a little money invested in maintenance. Staff was friendly but sparse and golf carts older, indicating low revenue. It’s a shame this course is not better marketed and maintained as it could easily be one of the premier layouts on the south side of Indy. The positive of these negatives is that it’s relatively cheap and not busy. We played on Friday afternoon and had very little group pressure in front or behind us. With marketing and maintenance this place should be packed on a Friday. They should take a page out of Shadowwood and offer discounted membership to exponentially increase traffic for short term cash flows. That’s my two cents… will certainly play it again as the value is there."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,This was a great deal to play this course! This course is in great shape the best it’s been in years. Pace of players usually always fast me and my golf buddies love playing at heartland crossing. We will be back next week to play again. Thank you Golf now for including heartland crossing as a course to pick in the scroll.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Love this course ! A little on the high dollar side. Sand traps were useless.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,This course was great and the pace of play was fantastic for a weekend morning. I had a 7:57AM tee time and was told I would be paired with a twosome for the round. Well i asked everyone around the practice green near the 1st tee if they were the 7:57 tee time and never got a 'yes' from any of them. I ended up teeing off alone about 4 minutes late since i was waiting for the twosome I was supposed to be playing with. I ended up playing the entire round as a single behind a threesome and i barely saw them after we made the turn to hole 10. This course is really fun and offers some great holes with a couple challenging approach shots into a couple of the longer holes. I'll definitely be back
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"I had worked with the manager, Jarod, for several years prior to his running of the course. When a yearly get together with friends took us to Indianapolis, we took the opportunity to play a round."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,We very much enjoyed our round of golf and Jarod took the time to walk us through the round and offer insight to the course and the Indianapolis area while we played through a full 18 holes. The staff he has working the course was responsive and respectful to all players and we witnessed them give interact excellently with regulars and us as new comers to the course.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,I would recommend a round of golf here to anyone in the Indianapolis area or visiting. Between the course itself and a welcoming staff it will be a great experience.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Greens, fairways, and tee boxes were in good condition. Keep the ball out of the bunkers and the areas outside the rough, as these areas are not getting attention. 5 sets of tees to fit a wide range of players."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,It's a shame that this challenging course will eventually be sold to make room for more houses.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Excellent value on Golf Now.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Massive rains the night before. A few soggy areas to be expected, and overall the fairways and greens were in great shape and drained very well."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,The American and Military Branch flags on the flagsticks was a really nice touch.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Heartland is on my regular rotation of courses to play in Indy each summer.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"It was a pleasure to play Heartland Crissing. The greens were fair and true rolling. The fairways and tee boxes were well marked and groomed.Teery Schill joined us on the back nine and shot an astounding 31 at age 75. The joy of golf is truly alive in him. Inly negative qas the lack of food since I had not eaten lunch.Go play, enjoy the value prices ."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,First visit this year and loved seeing the course so well prepared. The greens were fair and the fairways granted tons of roll out.I was not in any bunkers today but they looked playable.. Parterned with local legend Terry Schill who shot his age (again). Highlight of the day was ragle 2 on number 17..Price is commensurate with current pricing.Enjoy
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,I was pleasantly surprised on how great a shape the couse was in this early in the season
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"No rakes for bunkers, so sadGreens 7 out of tenTee box’s and fairways not bd for 3/13Killer for price 18.69$"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Why build a golf course if you're only going to sell it for a PUD? This is a well-kept, fun playable course with lots of traps, little water, interesting holes, and perfect cart paths that will.soon be made into a housing community. Join Mitchell would be proud."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Love this course but the sand traps are in bad shape / need a lot of work.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"I played the course as I saw reviews that said it has come back from the pathetic state it was in pre-COVID. I was fooled. The course is still awful. It MAYBE has come up from the sewer to the toilet bowl only because the greens are decent now. Other than that is awful. Dead tee boxes, weeds in the fairway, bushes uncut and in the way and bunkers with NO sand. The place should be bulldozed for a housing development"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Oh…and shoutout to the grump who was yelling at me for hitting my tee shot when he was 60yds from the green…on a 390 yard hole!!!!
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Course played fair and conditions were good. First time here so it was a little tricky knowing where to land it and what was behind all the very well placed bunkers. This is an underrated course for sure. Visually appealing. Pin locations were a little boring on the day I played but the possible set ups here could be really fun. 6400 blue tees gave lots of chances for birdies but required a good game plan on how to play the different holes.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Got to play this SW Indy course for the first time in a long time; the place had fallen into serious disrepair and it was “I’m considering walking off mid-round” bad a few years ago. This meant utter garbage tee boxes and huge patches of sand and/or dead grass at multiple different places throughout the course. New owners probably got it on the cheap out of bankruptcy, so good for them."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"They’ve really pulled a 180 out here and it’s frankly great to see. The course is a Nick Price design, and initially it had more sand than most FL courses I’ve played. It also stretched out pretty long if you played the Price Tees (like 7600). The design was tough and a bit unique for the area."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"They’ve really put some care into the place and now it deserves to be back in your Indy-area rota. Tees were nicely grassed and leveled; fairways were fully grown in and rough was fair. I can see small areas they’ve let go to more long-ish heather, which is likely saving them some maintenance costs. The robust amount of bunkering has been trimmed by maybe a few, but thankfully the character of the place has been maintained. They’ve been nicely refilled with quality sand, so no longer is it a doomsday when you go in one (getting out is all on you, player!). Greens were in great shape, fully brought back and very fair."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"The course starts out with a long Par4 with a great big 2-tiered green; you’ll want to be on the right level or it’s three putt city. The second hole is a nice short Par3 which plays over a pond to a tricky green. The third is a gettable Par5 with a skinny green surrounded by fall-off areas. So right out the gate you get a good mix of tests with all 3 hole layouts. They don’t use a lot of pure template holes, but really more like an homage to the classics (so there’s a “Short”, a “Cape”, a “Himalayan”, etc with a twist). The back nine is one of the better tough layouts in the area; I really love the stretch from thirteen through fifteen, with the tough uphill Par5 thirteenth to kick it off. You want to choose clubs wisely here!"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"You’ll need to bring your sand game still, as there’s a lot of strategically placed bunkers; the wind is usually blowing out there too, so the course can chew up your score in a hurry. But with some pretty generous landing areas, you can score well if your approach game is on."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"I’m glad to see the place get the attention it needed; we paid weekend rates of $49 and it’s definitely punching well in that weight class with other Indy courses. Don’t bother reading the old reviews, just come out and see for yourself: It’s back, baby!"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"This is another course that has been under going somewhere work ! Burned down a lot of the brush and trashy areas , course was wet and recently aurated so it was playing slow ! It should be a track track to play this summer when things grow back ! They are working on the bunkers around 18 and have put sand in some bunkers to repair them ! I had fun playing it and seeing it for the first time in 7 years ! They are working on the course hard so it will be a good track soon !!"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Always have enjoyed playing here when in the area, and was disappointed to have seen it fall into disrepair, but new owner has dramatically turned around the conditions in just a few short years. Yes there are still some areas that need attention, but the greens were fantastic and fairways looked good. Staff was very friendly and accommodated quickly when I asked about playing an additional 18."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Course is in great shape and still getting better Working on bunkers now you’re looking really good I don’t think you’ve ever been that good also they have Coors light again
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Been playing at this course for about a decade, its under new owner's staff and management certainly making a good comeback to becoming one of the best courses around."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Heard the golf course has new ownership and mgt so decided to give it a try. Huge difference from when I played there 2 yrs ago. They are doing things the right way. Very conscious of Social Distancing & providing sanitized carts (even set up outside to check us in). The quality of the course is night and day compared to what it has been in the past. Hopefully they continue trending in this direction - other southside courses are being neglected so definitely hitting this place up on the reg!
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Course is in great shape right now in early Spring Staff great about keeping Golfers safe From Virus carts Cleaned each and every time used . One thing Bad did not have coors Light .!,,"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,For an early March round I wasn’t sure what to expect. The last time I played here it was in awful shape but can honestly say it was in better shape today than it was two summers ago.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Sure the greens were a bit bumpy but the grass hasn’t grown let alone cut.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Cudos to the new ownership for bringing it back to life and look forward to coming back later in the year.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"General course conditions continue to improve under new management. Greens were dramatically improved compared to this spring when I last played it. Hopefully with the greens back in good shape, they will be able to start addressing other needs such as bunker rehab and fairway drainage. This course has always been one of my local favorites, and it was sad to see it gradually decay. But it is definitely trending in the right direction and I look forward to playing it more next year. Keep up the good work!"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,This course has been around for a while but seems like a new course to me! I had not played it in decades and decided to give it a try - boy am I glad I did!
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"The course is extremely playable, yet challenging. The greens were in excellent shape - undulating but rolling true."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Fairways were outstanding, considering it was Fall."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,There were very few people on the course so pace of play was outstanding. I would highly recommend this course to anyone; if it wasn't so far away from my house this would be my home course!
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Have been playing this course since it opened in 1998. Had always been a great course to play was was always in great shape. Several years ago something happened that it began to fall in disrepair. Played this course twice this year and was pleasantly surprised by the changes taking place. Heard new management took over and they are now putting some money back into the course to bring it back to where it was or even better. Last time I played the bunkers were still in the process of being redone and repaired but the rest of the course was looking good. Very happy to see this as this is a very nice course to play for all levels. Definitely returning to play more often next season.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,The new owners and staff have turned this course around in less than a year. All the greens are now back to a great condition. I'm happy because this is my favorite course. Challenging course but not overwhelmingly difficult. Respect the sand. You will use all the clubs in your bag at this course. A nice variety of holes. Enjoyable.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,This place has made a complete turnaround! You can see the improvements and the conditions are significantly better than other courses in the area for less out of my pocket.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"I first played this course 5 years ago when the Indiana PGA used Heartland Crossing as a state open qualifier. It was okay then but in the time since, the course hit some hard times. Over the last 6-months, you can see that ownership and management are working hard to put Heartland Crossing back on the map of great Indiana public golf courses. Give them another 12 months and this course will most certainly be the best option on the southside again."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,New team at Heartland has turned this course and event center around. All greens are coming back nicely. The bunkers are being worked on daily. There was a tournament going on after we played as well as an open house later in the week. The course has come back to life. Check it out!
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"This course has done a complete turnaround. From the clubhouse to the course, it is coming along nicely. I encourage those that haven’t played for a while to stop by. You will notice a huge difference from last year. The greens are coming in back nicely and the bunkers are much improved. Prices are right and staff is friendly."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Good course and layout. Sand traps are plentiful and deep, but don't have any sand."

The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"This is a very nice course- a fun track... but the very worst greens I’ve ever seen. Large patches of missing grass on just about every hole. One green was so far gone they had the green closed and cut a new green into the fairway.... just unbelievable. I got a great deal on Golf Now, but won’t be going back. Real shame as the course is fun to play and challenging!"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Greens great fairways good great place to play again
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,The green hasn’t been there on hole 11 or 12 i dont remember but for over a year now.. cant even putt on it.. and the sand is like hitting on concrete ..
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Played May 28, 2019 and the course was in very good condition. My only complaint would be the quality of the sand traps. Overall a pleasurable course to play and a good value for the money. I especially liked the scorecard/booklets with the layout of each hole, nice touch for folks not familiar with the course layout. I'll definitely play this course again."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"My brother, son and myself played Memorial Day. The course was in very nice condition in spite o all rain we have gotten of late. We played 18 holes and cart in 3 hours and 15 minutes. Had it not rained really hard we would’ve been done even sooner. Course has a few fixes but overall very glad with improvements."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"I have played in the past but this might be my last time playing here. The price is reasonable if the conditions weren’t so bad. There was one hole with no green, so couldn’t even putt. There was a terrible smell in several parts of the course like sewage was draining in the course. I went to is the restroom and it was swarming with flies, worst smell I have ever smelt in my life, toilet clogged. I opened the door and had to run away it was so bad. I wouldn’t wish my worst enemy step foot in that place.I did not speak with anyone in the clubhouse as I was just ready to leave. If they cleaned up a few things it could be a really nice course but not sure if I will ever go back if I’m paying."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,We used to love playing here. The course is a mess now.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Course needs work and they know it and are in the process of working on it. I wish them luck and Hope course is back to its full potential soon. Staff was great , friendly, we enjoyed our round"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,We have played this course at least 25 times last year and the two times this year we have noticed bigImprovements.Greens were fast today ! Fairways and tee boxes were cut.With better weather bad spots will start filling in and the tenth hole will be sodded and ready in aCouple of weeksYou can tell the new owners are working on itCannot wait for warmer and drier weatherWill be back soonBG
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"My first time here for starters. I couldn’t have left more happy, after shooting horribly all day.The staff was more than generous and friendly. New owners and are improving the course greatly. I could tell the work that’s being done while I was there. Excellent fairways. Fast greens (which I like) and well marked tee boxes, make it easy on the eyes, and clubs. The clubhouse was beautiful and had lots of nice items to choose from, from the bar and pro shop. The cart paths were smooth, yard markers throughout, each hole was labeled well. I am happy to go back. I could go on and on about the bang for the buck this course offers."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,The course is in terrible shape! We paid $27 a piece to play and over paid by $25!!!
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Have played here occasionally for several years and saw conditions deteriorate. Love the layout, butmaintenance of course is depressing. Even withGroupGolfer discounts, it is not worth the trip from the NE side of Indy under these conditions. Toomany well-kept courses available in area."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"The course is in terrible shape! Crab grass is plentiful throughout the fairways and the tee boxes are a mess. You better be accurate on the approach shot, half the green is marked as ground under repair on most greens. Very disappointed!! Won’t be going back."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Was told when I asked how the course was that they had a fungus issue and they had a temporary green on #10. The rough was very tall and thick, 2-3 greens actually had ropes through the middle because of the fungus problem. Most all greens are not in very good shape at all, just really think this should have been disclosed prior to booking."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Course was in horrendous shape. Greens were eaten with disease. Patches of dead spots and/or bare. There was not a smooth green on the corse. Staff did not inform us, nor was it noted on GN at time of reservation of our tee time. Staff was asked if they would provide a rain heck or the opportunity to play again, and this was denied. They stated that we should have been informed by their morning staff and even they we were not, there was no efforts to make it right. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY!"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"I haven't played in years. This was really disappointing. Crabgrass overtaking fairways and tee boxes (especially number 10). On almost all of the greens, a significant portion of the green had no grass. Tees hadn't been mowed and were terrible. Fairways looked like rough. Greens looked the way the fairways should be (at least where the grass was) I only paid $22 including cart and felt it was way overpriced"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,The course was full of weeds the greens were burning up and it was not very well taken care of from the last time that we played it
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"This is a great course and pace of play was outstanding. Fairways and Tees were in tremendous shape, BUTTTTT the greens were horrible. One green (10th) was fairway cut short while they try to reclaim the actual green. Most greens have over 50% damage. The damaged areas are not cut nor are they marked as area under construction to take relief. It appears the course burned up the greens by watering during heat of the day or not watering."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Love this course but you might want to give them a month or so to get the greens back in shape.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"My wife and I played Heartland crossing on July 27, 2018. I have played Heartland many times over the past 17 years. At one time I thought it was the nicest daily fee course on the south side of Indianapolis. That is no longer the case. I knew it had fallen on hard times but never expected it to be so bad. Every part of the course - tee boxes, fairways, greens, etc. were in horrible shape. The greens were especially bad - unputtable. We played for $16.00 each with a Golfnow hot deal and $16.00 was too much to pay for the condition of the course. I hope someone will purchase this coure and restore it to what it once was. I am hoping that will happen but, in the meantime, don't waste your money."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"I've played this course several times this year,. Last month in fact. The greens are in terrible condition, brown spots where grass is dead and large clumps of sand on the greens. The fairways are mostly dead. What a shame the course has fallen to such a bad state. 70%of greens are burnt or dead and 50% of fairways are dead.They should have refunded our money on site but no such luck."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Got what I paid for - thank you for affordable rates
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Absolutely got what I paid for. Great afternoon round.Greens need some love - a few were burnt up.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"This is, hands down, the worst conditioned course I've played around Indianapolis in the 3 years I've lived here. Not sure if it's disease, money problems, or likely both. But this is not a course that is worth anyone's time or money in its present condition."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"The warning signs were evident from the start when we arrived 35 min before our 7:30 Sunday morning tee time and beat the workers to the course. It only went downhill from there as we practiced on the putting green and noticed large dead patches on it and elsewhere. As evidenced by the attached photos most of the small greens on the course were dead, with sand or mud replacing grass for large patches - they were basically unputtable. Where there was grass it was mowed at different heights, so there were stripes on the green, as well as parts around the fringe that were missed completely by the mower. The mower also left grass clippings behind that had to be wiped away when we even attempted to putt."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"The rest of the course had not been mowed at all. The grass in my backyard is shorter than the tee boxes, and I haven't mowed in a week. The fairways and rough were patchy at best. The sand, which is everywhere on the course, is unraked and thin. All the bunkers are deep as well, so this was particularly penal if you even attempt to hit out of them. The rough was very lush, and we spent a lot of time hunting for balls one bounce off the fairway. Add to that no one fixing any divots or anything, and yeah, you get the picture."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"It's been a while since I've said paying $15 to ride 18 holes was a ripoff, but this was an absolute ripoff. Sad, because the course is a Nick Price layout, and would be very challenging if it were in playable condition. But this is to the point where it needs to be shut down and reworked before anyone sinks another dime into playing the place. Run away from any deals here, it's just not worth it."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Greens overall in bad shape. Many burnt areas had been sanded where there is no grass. A few of the smaller greens only had partial grass coverage. What grass was growing was fairly long and slow pace putts.Tee boxes average. A few of the boxes did not have the markers out in place. Fairly tall grass and a few weeds, but no big bare spots.Fairways average. Grass was a little long but had been mowed. No weeds and full grass coverage with no bare areas or ground under repair.Sand traps were mostly groomed and in average to above condition. Some were hard and needed more sand. No weeds in them.Rough had been mowed with some thick areas that would suck down errant balls. Tall grass and waste areas in good shape.Pace of play was excellent on a Sat afternoon.Overall we had fun and a good round. Paid $31 to play and would've liked to see better conditions as other deals are out there for nicer places. Probably won't go back this year unless a special circumstance. Hope some improvements in green conditions are in the works."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Management clearly doesn’t understand how close they are to loosing the course. They are extremely close to loosing several of the greens. There is no excuse for this with the summer we’ve had. You can tell that they have skimped on maintenance for quite some time now. The course is a great design that is in a mediocre neighborhood that probably doesn’t get the traffic to be profitable, which leads to poor maintenance. They seem to be headed for the same fate as saddle brook. They need to do something quickly. I live close by so I hope that doesn’t happen, but I will also not be playing this course again anytime soon unless they are giving green fees away figuratively speaking."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"This course has a pretty good layout, but honestly have never played a course in worse conditions. 4 of the 9 holes had big sand spots all over them. The fairways, rough and sand are horrible as well. The pace of play was horrible. Overall terrible experience."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"We was very happy to play here. We haven’t played at Heartland Crossing in almost 4 years. We arrived early and course wasn’t busy, we was able to tee off about an hour early. Overall course was in great condition. There was a handful of greens that were a little worse for wear but still very playable. Look forward to playing again soon!"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Overall, the course is in much worse condition than it was 10 years ago. The fairways are dry and some of the greens are in bad shape. The front nine is in okay condition. Just don't expect to play the same course that you did years ago."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Had played here years ago, course in much better condition then.......needs lots of TLC to bring it back...rate of $18 was great, but tempered by the overall course condition."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,The layout is interesting but could use more water and a couple of the greens could use a little help but pin placement helped. $18 is hard to beat will play again hopefully they find the valve for the sprinkler system.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,They are putting a ton of work into this place and it’s really showing!
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Heartland was at one time one of my favorite places to go. After being bought and sold a few times it's now in such a state of affairs it no longer is.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Staff are friendly, but the bang for the buck is just poor. I paid $36 to play on a Friday morning to play on a course that looked like it hadn't seen a mower all year."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"1 foot tall grass splotches in fairways, 6"" clumps on tees, and #1 green, which is always been a terrible design, has a GUR section in the middle that looks like an example of bas plastic surgery."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,As you get to the back 9 it becomes obvious what's on the horizon for this place. It's a housing edition in 2 years from what I can see.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"It's really too bad, it used to be such a nice place."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Heard they were hosting a 16 team HS tournament this weekend. They should be embarrassed at the condition of the course.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Generally like this course. Challenging and interesting layout. The rough however is way too long. Even just off the fairway it is quite deep. I lost 3 drives I had a good line on and if I had needed to play more quickly I would have lost double that number. 4-5 inch rough is overkill in my opinion.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Course is in terrible shape, fairways not as good a bad muni, bunkers should be played and marked as ground under repair. Course is off my list till mid summer. Oh by the way only played 13 holes 5 some in front from 10 till we quit was taking 30 minutes a hole and they were not letting anyone thru."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,This is a very nice course and the owners are making improvements every day. I play 3 rounds a week and most of them here.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Dandelions all over tees, fairways and rough. Very surprised. Plus range closed because ball picker broken. Greens very slow. 5 on stimp meter."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Always a good mix of open and challenging. Greens were good. Fairways still in early Spring condition, but I liked the slightly longer cut on the fairways."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"So sad to watch this once nice course get worse & worse every year. Weeds in fairway, on tee boxes, & greens last year & more this year. Zero effort to make things better the last 2 years for sure. The ONLY reason to occasionally play is it’s so cheap on golf now. The poor conditions however now outweigh the bargain. Such great potential. Sad!"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"A good golf course. A good layout, plays well. Fair with off shots. Course needs a little TLC on the greens and tee box, could be early in the season with some recent wet conditions. Great value. Will play again."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Last year i played this course the fairways were lack of grass the fairways are filled in with new grass sand in bunkers,greens in great shape planning to play this course a lot this year greens keepers great Job."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Only played here 1 time in 2018 Because of conditions. I live close by and would like to play there more. I wouldn’t play there for free with present conditions. This course unfortunately has went down hill Year after year. Conditions are just awful from tee to green. Doesn’t seem like you have have a knowledgeable or caring maintenance staff. This is so unfortunate because the layout is great. Hopefully you get a new maintenance staff that cares. I see that you have new ownership but will not improve with the present maintenance staff.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Great course and layout. Very good value for the money.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Love this place , used to be very difficult. Went through a bad patch but has turned the corner and getting better. I think they are working on their bunkers and once they get them filled in and back in shape they will be one of my fave courses again."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Played several years ago with a Golfnow coupon for 2 rounds @ $38 total. Total waste of money. Course used to be fantastic, hard, well kept. The day we played fairways were a disaster, greens terrible."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,I love the course. I have been playing here more . I noticed the last couple times I played here I think the men’s club goes out on the back nine and you catch up with him and then there’s 4five or six of them playing together so they can hold everything up
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"This tract is great and the course is in good condition, contrary to some of the older reviews I've seen. Its eminently challenging and tests your sand game and iron accuracy to the max. One downside...by the 7th hole we had to call for an different electric cart as the battery was down. Same thing happened with the other cart by the 11th. By the end of the round the third cart was about to die. What's up with all that? Perhaps all batteries were purchased at the same time and all are now on their last legs? Anyway, would play again."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,The course is in excellent shape and the rates are lower than about anywhere.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,The atmosphere and quality of course carts and staff was phenomenal. Mid november and all the cuts are perfect. Well built. Difficult but not too hard. Amazing. Definitely going back
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,They just plug in sanding greens greens were covered with sand was hard to put butter put a little adventure in the game I know it had to be done that day before
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"WE WERE ABLE TO PLAY EARLY ON THE COURSE, HOWEVER WE WERE BACKED UP ALL DAY WAITING 5 TO 15 PER HOLE. THEY OVERBOOKED. THE COURSE ALSO HAD A DRIVER ON A TRACTOR AERATING THE ENTIRE COURSE. EVERY HOLE HAD PLUGS ALL OVER THE FAIRWAYS AND AROUND THE GREENS. THIS MAKE GOLF PLAY VERY HARD. SHOULD'NT THEY WAIT UNTIL OCTOBER WHEN THE COURSE SHUTS DOWN ???"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"It is the time of year for course to aerate, but there was no effort to clean it up. Had a 3:50 tee time, was charged more than golf now said, had to get a refund. Still have notGotten that. They had a band playing at the club house when the group of 4 of us were on 11."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,No one told us they would be blaring jazz. It was good! But we would have preferred to hear it AFTER the round.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Never going back. $21 is cheap for a round, yeah, but I would only pay $10."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Getting much better place to play golf I think the management is finally figure it out and the fairways and greens are all coming back in the play not a bad place to play
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,This was the slowest and most cluttered time on this course. People were jumping holes and going back and forth causing back ups every where. On hole 11 and 12 it took 37 minutes to play I called the pro shop about people cutting holes and nothing was done there was none monitoring start times just bad day. The course was burnt bad and we didn't have a lot of heat this year. And oil spilled everywhere from what looks like the lawn mower.I like this course a lot but this time was was a bad one
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"I was excited to come back to my hometown and play what I remembered as a great course. Heartland Crossing was always a challenge and pristinely maintained. They haven't changed the layout but the maintenance of the course has severely diminished. All the bunkers and traps, the course is known for, go without attention. Tee boxes were unkept with weeds and the corpses of tees littering the ground. The greens were disappointingly slow. It is sad to see what was such a great golf course fall into such disrepair. I hope the owner will take heed, recognize this transgression and restore this former beauty to her original glory."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"First green is diseased. Second fairway like a swamp, rest of course baked out. Bunkers have minimal sand - are truly hazards to play from. Plenty of crabgrass. Even with a Hot Deal rate, over priced based on course conditions. A total disappointment."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Decent course with multiple levels of difficulty, stay out of the traps if you can, they are plentiful and deep."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Let's get things clear from the beginning. I like Heartland Crossing a lot. I have a fairly light work schedule over the Summer, so I tend to play here about once a week, even though it's a half hour drive. Usually it doesn't disappoint."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Tuesdays apparently are different. The rate is much cheaper, and it seems like everybody wants to play. The pace was very slow. And so was our cart."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Around hole 5, we started to realize that our cart wasn't really going uphill all that well, but it's Indiana, so it's pretty flat, and we kept going. But we made a call to the clubhouse to see about getting another cart. We'll get one right out to you..."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"After limping through the next two holes, we called again. Oh, they didn't get you a new one? We'll send one out right away!"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"When we made the turn, we were told there were no more carts. Or we could wait 20-30 minutes for another one, since people were waiting at the first tee for theirs. We decided to try to make it, but ended up needing to push our cart to help it up some of the hills on the back 9."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"I'm definitely not going to play another Tuesday round, since there are probably not enough carts to go around. Overall, we'd probably have been happier if we were just told from the beginning that there wasn't going to be another cart for us."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"This course has steadily gone downhill in recent years, its obvious that they are not generating enough money to keep up this course and probably are not paying a greenskeeper enough for them to care about maintaining this course. Its too bad because this is a nice layout and could be a very nice course. I used to play this course regularly but I will not be back after this visit. Would rather pay more to play a course in good condition. Would not surprise me if this course closes soon."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,The course is in bad shape. Fairways are brown and dry. Some greens have damage. It looks like a course on the way out. Not sure how many years it has left.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Good layout no maintenance on tees, fairways, sand traps greens were nice and challenging a little rough though"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Sadly the course has fallen into disrepair. The bunkers are literally unplayable, with weeds growing in almost all of them, very little sand in several, many seem to have simply been abandoned.Sad to see a nice design falling into this type of condition."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Great layout with lots of challenge.Course used to be meticulously kept.Kind of like that really hot girl in high school and then you see her after 15 years and think wow what happened. She's probably still a lot of fun, but not what she used to be.If you hit the ball in the right places and don't stray from the fairway, you'll be fine.Go play it, but play a discounted rate.Enjoy"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Heartland Crossing has everything a golfer could ask for. There are shots over water, right hand turning fairways, and left hand turning fairways. The best thing is the course is always in good condition of course you get the normal challenges related to weather and time of year but it is always fun to play."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"A great day to enjoy some Father-daughter time. The staff was friendly, the greens were very receiving, but the pace of play was a bit slow. We had to wait on the group ahead of us and felt rushed for the first nine holes, but after we passed them it was full steam ahead. The plethora of traps always seemed well managed, but often it was without a rake within close proximity."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"This is a good layout that isn't in great shape - but would be worth it if the pro shop staff could wake up! Cart started dying on the way to the first green. Called pro shop to get another cart immediately. They said oh, I don't think they charged all of the carts last night. Really, why not!"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,No one showed. Cart made it just past the tee on 3. Walked with cart bag until hole 8. This is after 4 more calls to the shop. Final call was a threat. Finally got the cart.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Not going back ever!
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,The links style was fun to play. Carts need GPS. The course was a bit difficult find but we'll worth it.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Moved away from area 20 years ago. Always enjoyed playing HC prior to move. Still one of the best values around the Indianapolis area. Try to avoid the bunkers and you will enjoy your round more.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,There were a lot of weeds in the fairways. Greens were decent but could be better.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Around the greens were sand bunkers have been filled in needs more grass
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Pros: Inside Staff was very friendly.I played as a single so luckily I only had to spend 2 and a 1/2 hours at this dreadful place.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Cons: How much time ya got?Course in terrible condition. They pulled off the unbelievable task of making the greens dreadfully slow yet impossible to hold! Even with a wedge! Honestly you'd be better served stopping at the local hardware store and picking up a sledgehammer to replace your putter. Yet the greens are so firm you don't need a divot tool. If it's a front pin (which 75% of them were that day) getting anywhere near the flag is not an option. Even with wedge in hand. 17 green was half dead! Now on to the bunkers...links course so plenty of bunkering yet no two bunkers the same. Some, plenty of sand and consistent, others, none.I play to about a 2 hdcp and I don't think I've ever played a course that I've been so penalized hitting good shots."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Avoid this course until either they get a new greenskeeper or invest tons in maintenance or both.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"As I said to a friend, a great motto for this place should be: ""A great place to play if you live nearby and you're almost out of gas."""
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"If Nick Price saw the state of his design, he'd have his name removed from the scorecard."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Very nice course. Lots of improvement in last year and more to come.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"The course layout is one of the most fun and challenging in the central Indiana. Most of the fairways are infested with dandelions. The sand traps are half emptied. The greens and tee boxes are in good shape, but could be better. This course would be amazing if more time was spent on maintenance. Staff were friendly and the price is right."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Course used to be nice to play at, but grounds and conditions are horrible now. Won't go back until moderate improvements have been made, at least."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"I really want this course to be better. Love the layout. Has some very unique fun holes. But, the Driving range is full of weeds and had not been cut recently. Greens were shaggy and extremely slow. New sand being put in is extremely hard and very shallow. Lots of weeds in rough and some in fairway. Of the courses I've played this spring, it is by far in the poorest condition. Only redeeming factor was it was $27."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,The length of this course really suits my game. The staff is super friendly.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Well maintained even through winter, it's a beautiful course, but not for the faint of heart."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"I don't think I've ever seen so many greenside and fairway bunkers outside of Myrtle Beach, SC courses."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Makes use of a pretty good mixture of risk-reward, target holes w/ straight-up ""greenlight"" holes."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,This is the best shape that I have seen this course in in a long time and looks really good the bunkers on playable .oh winter doesn't move in to quick like players tell after Christmas
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"I found the course in better shape this fall than this past summer.. Looks like some improvements are in the works. The course is fun yet challenging.. I only ended up in 4 bunkers. The fairways, greens and bunkers were in great shape. I would encourage anyone in the Indy area to try this course out as you should have a great time.."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Nov. 2, 75 degrees, immaculate greens, even the fairways were good (several bare spots, but hey, in November who cares?). They even had crews out blowing leaves off the greens and fairways. This is a links course, so playing off the tips is nuts unless you hit 350, but the Gold tees still give you 6500 yds, and the course is beautifully laid out. With Golf Now's Hot Deal, it was absolutely the best bargain ever!"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,I had a very enjoyable round.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Course was a little damp since it rained the day before. The layout is challenging and you have to plan your shots. I plan to do better when I play this course again. I was alone and tried to get paired with someone who had played there before. Instead, I got paired with a couple of guys who work for Allstate and we all had a blast learning our way around the course. Playing with those guys and having fun added to the adventure. Will definitely play it again."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,This course needs a serious input of funds. I live on #7 and the bunkers they have taken out (and there are a lot of them) are still GUR. The bunker near the 7th green has been unplayable for over a year. We have greens like #17 that for all intents and purposes are so full of mold they are unplayable. The worst part of it all is that this is all due to poor planning. When Nick Price first designed the course and when it first opened it was a masterpiece. My love for this course is the reason I moved here. What the design did not take into account is that this is Indiana. The 6 foot deep bunkers become 6 foot deep pools during the winter and in the spring require repair. It is financially impossible to repair the bunkers every year. Subsequently each entity that purchased the course from bankruptcy took bunkers out. Now the course is a shell of what it was and essentially has become a muny. #SAD.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"This course could honestly be one of the nicest in the state of Indiana and hopefully it will continue to get better, but it's in horrible shape and it isn't just because of fall approaching. The layout is top of the line, but maintence is a must on a course of this caliber. They need to market this course better and ask for donations or new ownership because this course could be a top golf retreat."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,1st Green is absolutely gorgeous!!after that it goes down hill.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Huge sand traps, although huge sand traps also need maintaining. 1 of the holes I was about 180 out and went for the green, ended up short and into the bunker. When the ball landed--HUGE splash!Drain your bunkers!!The day I played it had not rained for several HOT days."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Tee makers-- yes tee markers are usually moved prior to mowing the tee box. No one was mowing tee boxes on the entire course, Tee box markers-some were laying on the ground, some were standing,SOME WERE MISSING! Just tee off from wherever you like??"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Yardage markers? Yes where? There are some painted yardage markers on the cart path, but does you very little good when you're in the fairway and have no view of the markings on the cart path."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"1st cut around the green-- some grass, mostly weeds"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Grass around the bunkers-- 2' tall--if its part of the course design so be it, would be a 1st of a kind out of my 30 years of playing. If not part of the design, hire some teenagers after school and on the weekends to help cut your weeds."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Course design-- EXCELLENT makes you think about your next shot. Don't plan to play here and use your driver on all 4's and 5's!Greens on the back 9 are fairly easy to read, true to what you are reading!!"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Wide fairways on most holes. Some need definite aim to position yourself well for the next shot!!
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Course Setting-- EXCELLENT nice quiet playing -- little artificial noise (road traffic-home owner mowing etc...)
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"A yardage book or some sort of course layout--better than the score card. If you have never played here, some good visuals would help immensely!!"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,This course has HUGE POTENTIAL if they would only get back to basics on basic course maintenance.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"For the amount of money I paid, I am happy but not satisfied with this course. I am usually not this critical of a course, but some things were just too plainly obvious not to mention to other players. Hopefully someone from the staff will take notice and make appropriate changes there. Word of mouth is huge in today's golfing economy, it can be bad and hurt or it can be good and help your course out immensely!"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"For the future I will play other courses for the same amount of money that are considerably better!! UNTIL, I see or read of better conditions here."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,This course was very good but recently getting worse.I'm very sad not to play a round here anymore..
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,This is one of those places where you walk in the pro shop and the pros are hanging out in the back office. Not too many groups out there but there was also no marshall so it was a free for all. There were people bopping in and out in front of us which normally would be fine but the pace was already crummy so when some random single hops in front of you its kind of annoying. Only paid $20 but if they sold it low in hopes to get me back for a premium rate at a later date they failed miserably.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"It had been 3 years since I had played this course and had very high reviews for this course. In fact told many of my friends about getting back to play this course again. There was a lot I didn't remember about this course like the front 9, but the back nine I remembered well.My dissapointment came when the GPS's were no longer on the carts and we found it very hard to find yardage markers, especially on the back 9 leaving us guessing many times as to how many yardswe were out. We looked for yardage markers but could not spend to much time because of holding up players behind us.Having said that I do love this course and do plan on coming back, especially at Golf Now price. I just hope this yardage issue is resolved and can be easily remedied even just by simply putting 200, 150 and 100 yard stakes out. At least then one can have a visual to go by. I wish the GPS's were still available though."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,I feel an over abundance of deep sand traps for my likeing. Hard to tell where fairway ended and rough starded
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Nice course but a few of the greens in real bad shape. Weeds starting to be a problem on a couple of fairways.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Course is in pretty good shape. A few greens have some bare spots due to disease. Fairways on back nine must have been long and wet when mowed. Clumps of mowed grass all over the fairways. The staff is always great. About 4.5 hrs to play. A little slow but this course can get really slow. You get a ton of ignorant golfers looking for their ball in the heather for ten minutes per hole. If that's you, buy cheap balls, drop, and move on!!!"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Course is in overall terrible shape. Greens and fairways are pretty well shot. Course is usually in relatively good shape. Heard that there is new ownership, maybe they don't know what they are doing or don't have the finances."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"I always enjoyed this course, expect that the greens on this day were horrible. There is not a smooth putt and some parts of the greens are not even playable, they are dirt. The worst I have seen this course"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Course conditions were average, but they are coming around. This is a very good course and very challenging! They have been doing work on the bunkers and the greens could be better. I would recommend this course to anyone, the staff is great!"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,It appears the course might be struggling financially. I played it in the past and it was nice. The greens are really poor and most of the traps do not have sand. they have been neglected.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Not the course it was two years ago.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Course layout is great, and fairway condition was good. No tree and little water trouble, but lots of sand traps in fairways and surrounding the greens. Greens were in very poor shape, with lots of small bare spots that made them bumpy, and some very large areas with no grass at all. Some traps might as well be filled in to make grass bunkers. A few are very large and deep directly in front of the green with no sand in them. They've looked like they were under construction for some time now. I love the layout and would play here more if the greens and traps were better shape."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,I have played this course several times over the years and it has been in a steady decline in terms of condition. It has finally hit rock bottom. Many of the bunkers have not been maintained and have tall weeds growing in them. ALL of the greens have dollar spot and it affects the roll of the ball. The 17th green has a large patch of dirt that has been painted green. We got a hot deal for $16 each and the course was not a good value at that price. You can find other places to play. Do not waste your time or money here.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"This links style course has a great layout. It's long enough to challenge the advanced golfer but can be forgiving to the beginner. The staff was very friendly and accommodating which always makes the experience very nice. However, there has been several reports going back to last month regarding the horrible conditions of the sand bunkers. Sadly it seems there has been no changes. While I was fortunate to avoid most of the bunkers those playing in my group was not so lucky. The bunkers are in dire need of sand and in several cases repair. While most of the greens are in ok condition, several are suffering from a fungus and neglect. I paid $22.00 as part of the Hot Deal on Golf Now so I'm not too upset. The price was about what you would pay for a course in this condition. However, it's hard for me to recommend this course to anyone giving these issues. I would have been happy to pay more if the bunkers and greens were in better condition. I hope they rectify these issues as I would love to come back and play this course again."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Overall this course is in excellent condition. They are redoing some of the bunkers which are close to 6 feet deep in some areas Very generous fairways but you missed the fairways and get into one of those bunkers it's severely penalizes you. The structural integrity of the restrooms on the course is highly questionable At one time we wondered if they should not generate their time to make those structures usable again Because a portable restroom was very close by
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Fun course that presents different challenges in different ways on each hole. Some holes barricade your tee shot with fairway bunkers. Others line a tight fairway with wispy grass. A couple of greens need some work, but the tee boxes, fairways, and rough were in fine condition. Overall, I'd recommend to a friend, so not too shabby."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"This course was nothing short of brutal! A lot course repair going on.. If you hit the sand, you could lose a ball (liked this guy) in the mud. Also bunkers are guarding the greens on a lot of holes like secret service protecting the President! It was a rough round!"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Heartland has had its ups and downs. Initially, it was roundly criticized for too many bunkers, many were later taken out to speed pace of play. That continues, but now as part of an overall upgrade/reconditioning of a real issue with the course. Always a good layout, it's quite lush as are most area courses with such a wet spring. They are steadily replacing sand and filling in what had been extremely large bunker complexes. Rare for the area, it wasn't too windy, but the green generally played fast. Clubhouse/bar area has been upgraded and you can tell they are making an effort to expand play with di$counted TUE green fees."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,This is a long course for average golfers. Most of the par 4's from the blue tees play 400 yards. Amazing advantage on course length from the women's tees. Almost stupid.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Gateways were well maintained, greens ran true (fast) but consistent! Bunkers were still being worked on after all the rain over the past couple of weeks..Overall great value for the money would recommend!"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"The bunkers and all around the bunkers are destroyed.I understand that they are trying to revamp this great layout, but they shouldn't be charging full price."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"I'd always wanted to check this course out, but it's over 45 mins from the north side of Indy. This place is awesome..very good layout, great fairways and greens..must play..18 for $18 on Tues"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,love the challenge but if you hit good shots you can score.not much sand in the bunkers but if you want more sand - go play a course where you pay more. Just rake it and then replace your ball - we are not on the pro tour.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,The course was recently aerated and a sixsomeslowed up play on the backside.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,This course is made tough by the number of bunkers strategically place to catch balls hit off the tee as well as those not hit to the green. I have no problem with this if there was consistent sand in the bunkers and they are raked. Unfortunately they could use a couple of train loads of sand. Greens are difficult and the wind can make for a long day if you are not hitting it straight but wide fairways can be forgiving if you are not in the bunkers.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Played here many times. Great value with online deals. Sand traps are a little dry and hard, but otherwise numerous and always a pleasure."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"First time playing this course and I found it to be very hard to say the least. It teases you off the tee box and rewards a well played shot, however several greens are just littered with bunkers and several greens are small. If you are not a well versed golfer, you will find this course eating your lunch. Even if I had played this course several times, I don't know if I would even know the shot to attack the green. So many bunkers. I will not be back until I am shooting well into the lower 80's lower 70's."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Have played this course many times, used to be one of my favorites, but condition of the course has deteriorated in the past several years, mainly the bunkers. If the bunkers cannot be maintained they should be removed/replaced with grass. They keep offering deals to get play, but if they would get the course in better condition they could charge a decent price and still attract players. Side note to staff: Your canned responses to comments from reviewers do not come across as genuine, better to leave them out. The fact is that little has been done for some time to ""improve"" the course conditions, which have been on a downward spiral for many years."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"it was dizzling when we started and dark when we finished. the lay out was nice, but the bunkers are a mess. many had dirt instead of sand. the problem is they are huge and numerous. we should have not played them at all. it looked like a group of nongolfers was there checking them out. they need much attention now and foreever due to their size and number."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Course is in good shape. Takes awhile to play but very enjoyable.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,It has huge sand traps around the course that are truly deep. Unfortunately they are unkept and surrounded with weeds as is the rough. A one time play.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,This course use to be great. I will have my league replace this stop on our tour in a few weeks. This course is all about the bunkers. With that being said they are like hitting from the cart path. They are even to hard to rake and place. I heard they are fixing for next year. So that's when I will go back. Unsat!!!!!!
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"This golf course allows for a lot of sprayed tee shots in the right places but many greens require pinpoint ball striking to hit them. I was fortunate enough not to find a single greenside bunker on my way around, so I cannot comment on what they were like. Holes 15-18 play very tough and I shot +8 on just those few to ruin an otherwise excellent round (I was +2 through 10 and well on my way towards a personal best). My iron play (a lot of mid irons, very few wedges) was pretty spot on most of the day, but the distance was enough to keep things plenty challenging."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"I played the gold tees, which played even longer than advertised, as the markers were pushed into the back tee box on hole 12, playing as another 450 yard par 4. This made for four par 4s playing 440 yards or more that day. Hole 15 is excellent yet extremely tricky. The angle off the tee is tricky to judge, and the green has a hollow that catches balls hit too long and numerous bunkers in front Note: the tall grass in front of the banana shaped teeing grounds caught my tee ball. I hit another and it was caught by the grass too, but it mysteriously made its way into the middle of the fairway about 220 yards out. Either tee the ball near the back of the box or take less than driver for some extra loft. Holes 12 through 15 might be the most scenic on the course, and number 10 has a tiny green right up against a water hazard. Other holes had lots of bunkers off the tee around 240-265 yards out, which were the perfect distance for gobbling up any slightly errant tee shot. Play it from the right markers and you're constantly trying to working your way around the traps off the tee. If you're going to play from the gold markers or further back, make sure you can hit the ball a decent ways or else you'll be hitting nothing but long irons and fairway woods into all of the par 4s. It really does play that long."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"The course is generally flat and easily walkable, while holes 13, 15, and 17 all feature elevated greens. Speaking of the greens, they were actually in excellent condition and rolled true when I played at a moderate pace around stimp 9 or so. What made the gold tees playable is that the rough was not particularly punitive, and I hit several greens in regulation from it. With a heightened premium on accuracy combined with the length it would be an extremely challenging course."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Good course with few homes. Bunkers need more sand but a lot of bang for the buck. Greens a bit slow.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"As much rain as we have had, course was in great condition"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Nice course. Too many bunkers though. Bunkers were deep and difficult. The course would be more fun to play if some of the bunkers were taken out. Course is good condition given then huge amounts of rain in the last couple of weeks. Nice layout with a good mix of holes.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"CHALLENGING COURSE! DO NOT PLAY IF VERY WINDY OR TOO WET. THESE FACTORS INCREASE THE DIFFICULTY AND DO NOT REPRESENT WHAT WOULD BE A TYPICAL DAY TO PLAY THE COURSE. THIS IS TRUE OF MOST COURSES, BUT MUCH MORE SO HERE."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,The course was wet of course after so many days of rain.The fairways are in good shape but could be cut better. Random grass's missed when cutting. Greens in good shape w a few blemishes and green moss patch's? Great facility but it is all about the little things. Halfway house has no soap or TP. Men's locker room leaves a lot to be desired. Time to refurbish and make new again!
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Beautiful layout. Trying to come back from several days of heavy rain. Doing a good job. Fairways and greens in excellent shape. A lot of traps. Dry traps have been worked on. Some still waiting to dry out. Really enjoyed the round. Visually beautiful course. Innovative design and placement of traps. Club selection critical.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Overall layout is pretty good I enjoyed the layout of most of those holes however there are a couple holes where a perfect drive is penalizing which was frustrating, I am all for difficult holes thrown in the mix but when you are given uneven lies and then must hit your approach to an elevated green surrounded on all sides by hazards, that's a little much. Like I said difficult holes are part of the game, but mixing every variety of penalizing situations on one single hole, well that's a little hokey. Several of the fairways are being resodded so the fairways are quite tall and allow for no roll due to their thickness. Heavy almost dirt sand traps with large rocks and small stones make them hazards to your clubs. The course was REALLY backed up, my tee time was over a half hour delayed and they didn't have enough carts to go around so we had to wait for one to come in off the course. The staff is very young and had no idea how to manage a large crowd. The staff insisted that one slow group had backed up the course 40 minutes, I find that hard to believe. The started said they moved the slow group and although 40 mins behind the Rangers had the course moving again and our round should take 4 hours 15 mimites...well it was 5 hours 30 minutes that includes 10 minutes at the turn for a hotdog and a Gatorade. Only good thing was the greed were in good shape but are unreceptive. You can hear the thump when your ball lands, so when pitching, plan on your ball rolling out, no hop and stops. This course could be great, it has definite potential, but in order to get there, the one thousand sand traps and damaged fairways need some TLC. The management staff needs some seasoning as well, maybe get some veteran golf course workers in there. I hope the course gets the help it needs as this place could be a true test of golf in the future. As for now it doesn't demand any premium pricing but is worth an afternoon goIf you get a good green fee rate but don't pay the prime rate, you'll be disappointed. I gave a 3 star rating because the club house, driving range, pro shop, snack bar, and putting green are very nice."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"The course was in good shape considering all the rain that has fallen recently (10""). The course has it's challenging moments yet it offers something for everybody... including numerous bunkers. The whites are a standard and fair distance and the greens are in great shape.. Each hole is different."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Heartland is a very good course. A couple of caveats: You need to play the correct set of tees based on your ability. Not doing so will make your round less enjoyable than at other courses. Secondly, there are many sand traps that come into play and it would be unusual for most players not to hit a few of them. One of my friends calls it the Sahara....it is not that bad...however they can be steep and challenging. If you have big issues with sand, you might think twice. Having said this, it is a very interesting and fair course. Conditions are very good. Greens had just been sanded and yet they were very good considering."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"This course is not what it was a few years ago. Although the greens were in great shape, the general condition of the course is now average at best. The thing that made this course a great challenge in the past were the bunkers. They were not well cared for; there were only a few rakes; and most had very little sand in them. That is sad, as this was once a great test of golf."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,The course was in good condition although the bunkers could use a lot of help. My main issue is if you get rid of your gps on the carts mark the course at the vert least. There are no 200 150 100 yard markers and that is rediculous and most of the sprinkler heads are not marked either come on
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"All of Heartland crossing was in very good shape with the exception of the bunkers. Many had weeds in them. Lots of them had very little sand. Some had enough sand. They are filled with crushed limestone which is hard enough to get out of, but add the problems listed above...... and duck! If the bunkers were in good shape this would be a once a weeker on my schedule. So if you can avoid bunkers you will have a great round. If you don't avoid bunkers you will have a few 4 letter words come out of your mouth."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Course Condition has improved since last year, but there are still areas of bare spots in the fairways and many of the bunkers need to have the sand replenished. A few bunkers were like playing off of hardpan."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Course is a good challenge and fun to play.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Lots of bunkers on this course. They have to be the worst in Indiana. Hard as a rock, no sand, can't get your club under the ball. club just bounces off of the rock hard dirt. I tried using a rake to soften up what little sand was in the bunkers and the rake wouldn't even loosen up the little sand. terrible bunkers. Would not recommend playing at this course. I drove an hour from Columbus to play it, and that was a waste."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Was wet when we played but was still enjoyable . Will plan on playing again on nicer day.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Great facility! Highly recommend to any golfer! But.... Be prepared for sand traps!
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,The couse is open but nothing has been done. Greens had been aerated and bunkers hadn't been touch since the fall. I'm fine with that but for $35 a round I expected much better conditions.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Course was on his shape considering the time of year. A good challenge. I will be back.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Hey I got to play on 12/14/14 what am I going to say other then it was a great day! I have probably played this course 30-35 times. It is one of my favorites!
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Got there in the morning. The guy at the desk didn't know about a frost delay, then he came out and give us a few directions about the course. Then on the first tee he came out and told us we need to start on number 10. The greens were just arearated, most had nothing but holes and a lot of plugs still left on the greens, the holes that had been sanded were not done very even and some had nothing but a covering of sand. I realize it's the end of season, but really! There's a reason I dont play there but 1 time a year. I have played out 3 other couses in the past week and nothing even compares"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,This is one of my favorite courses in Indiana. Has some nice elevation changes. I also like that it has some risk/reward holes with some drivable par 4s.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"This is a great course especially for the price we played at, $18. I would definitely recommend to all who play this course to ""TEE IT FORWARD"" especially on a rainy day. There are 6 sets of tees and the average player should definitely play the Whites which are just under 6,000 yards. We played the Blues this time which are just around 6,400 yards and it was a bit too challenging would of had more fun playing from the whites. Almost every whole has a sea of bunkers surrounding the greens which makes your 2nd shot in very critical, having a hybrid or wood in on that shot makes playing well almost impossible. Over all though I love this course and would most definitely play it again."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"I haven't played this course in years, but they have reduced the number of bunkers on the course. I was surprised on the conditionsame of the tee boxes and greens. We had a real mild summer and they looked worn. Tee boxes did not have the markers set our yet."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,This course is truly for all handicapers. Great value for the amount to play.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Really enjoyed the course, wish a storm had not blown up on us at the 9th hole, would of loved to complete the round. We will return to play again. Course is suitable for every level of golfer!!!"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"We played twice in the past 10 days -- both times for about $20, which is a GREAT price for this course. Greens are fast, fairways are fast and burning out, and the bunkers have improved from earlier this year, though there is still work to be done."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Nice layout, however 20' deep bunkers and 20 bunkers in front of one hole is a little bit extreme, not a golf course for amateurs extreme undulations in some greens. not a course I will play again"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"NEED A RANGER ON THE BACK NINE!!!Great track. Great condition. Fast greens. Friendly members. Teed off at 11:00 AM. As a twosome we played the first 5 holes with little delay, then caught the crowd. A club member twosome in front of us asked if we wanted to play along with them. That made the delays for the rest of the round bearable. Made the turn OK, but after that, things really slowed down. Would like to see a ranger on the back nine. Pace of play was a little less than two hours front, BUT nearly two hours forty-five minutes back nine. Our new friends had to leave with four holes left. Our total pace of play was only 4 1/4 hours, but it was the longest 4 1/4 hours ever."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Course is in great shape. Greens needed little work but due to the weather here, it's expected. Play from the blues if you are an average golfer. You will enjoy your game much more."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,This is a great design but conditions have really gone downhill over the years.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"The character of this course is the bunkering and for a course of this caliber to have bunkers that for the most part are unplayable throughout, it's frustrating."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,The greens are very scarred by people not fixing ball marks but still aren't very plush to start with.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"This is a great but difficult course, especially playing at 5pm after a day of thunderstorms. I would definitely recommend to anyone who likes to play and be challenged."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"I love this course and have played it many times. The greens are in good condition but have burn spots on some of them at the edges. The big thing that has been let go is the bunkers. They have virtually no sand in them. They were raked fresh that morning but it was about 1/8th"" deep. You could not do a good bunker shot. I played it a couple weeks ago and the sand bottles were completely empty. This is a simple thing to go in order to allow players to help keep the course in good condition."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"There was some rain right before our tee time, but the course in excellent condition. Fairways in excellent condition. Greens were wet, but still quick and rolled out nicely. We would definately come back--especially at the golfnow rate of $28 for weekend."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,One of my favorite rounds of the year! Course can challenge anyone and you will have to hit shots to play well.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Everything but the bunkers were in good shape. Some bunkers were fine others were just dirt and rock. Clean them up and a 5 star course.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Great day of golf for good money! Large and deep bunkers make every shot into the green difficult and offer a cool look.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,I always enjoy playing here. Course is in great shape. Greens have lots of character. Sand traps pose a challenge on the back nine on several holes.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"I would play this course over and over again, loved it"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"I love and hate this course. The layout is fantastic, the price to play is awesome, the people are friendly. However, the course maintenance is horrid. There is little to no sand in most bunkers. There is weeds and grass growing in a lot of the bunkers. If you want to have 80-100 bunkers on the course you need to maintain them."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Nice course with a good track. Greens were rolling well. Lots of heavily bunkered greens and fairway sand that can run your score up quickly!
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Course was a little soggy in spots, but never had a plugged lie. Bunkers were in bad shape, almost no sand and lots of rocks. Greens were OK, but several greens had un-repaired pitchmarks."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"For mid-June in Indiana the course was in good shape, however the course is nowhere close to what it used to be 3 or 4 years ago. Definitely headed downhill. They also removed the really nice custom GPS units from the carts (new fleet of carts) which was a big selling point. Now they just have a single 150 driveway marker stuck in each fairway."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"In my opinion, they are progressing more to a muni style course instead of a higher end public course. I won't play for rack rates, always wait for a deal on GolfNow."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"The course was in good shape overall, the only disappointing aspects are the sand traps and the greens. The greens had a lot of pitch marks and the sand traps didn't have a lot of sand and appear to be under construction."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,The course is very good shape. It is a fun course to play with many challenges and opportunities to score. The bunkers are deep!
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Course has slipped last couple of years. Would have appreciated yardage markers - ones in fairway were almost impossible to see as grass had grown over them. Heather was cut down substantially. Limited number of players so money is not likely going to be there to keep the course up
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"The amount of bunkers on this course is ridiculous! The course plays as a test to ""Open"" style Links play. The Bunkers are very deep and they are everywhere! The worst part is, most of the bunkers have little to no sand in them which made for some frustrating shots. If you can hit a driver 275 + yards, I'd recommend playing the Blue Tee's. Anything shorter requires White Tee's, or as we saw with the wannabe's in the group ahead of us, you'll be holding up everyone on the course, all day. This course is very challenging, so if you do decide to take it on, play your game, pick the right tee's, and try and avoid the the 120+ bunkers."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"This course my my friends and my favorite but we will not go back. There is no yardage marking anywhere except a few sprinkler heads here and there. It took us 6 hours to play 18 and we had to let people through left and right because we spent literally about 8 minutes per hole searching for yardage markers. Called the course and they said they will put some markers in later after they finish bunker construction. Said they have every possible person on staff doing bunkers. We played at the course twice this week and never once said anyone working on any bunker. Yardage markers are much more important. They took out the GPS carts and should have put in other yardage markers immediately. Shoe selection in the pro shop is really bad. Left my shoes at home and they didn't even have my size in stock. Had to buy huge clown shoes and couldn't get any with spikes. For $45 per round I expect some yardage marking to be put in immediately. I was told I had to purchase a yardage marker book for $3 at the clubhouse. Sorry I don't pay for yardage. Other than that it's a great course, greens are nice, and fairways are nice. Love this course but will not drive 2 hours anymore until they put in yardage."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Lots of sand and water. Fun course.Challenging for a high handicapper like me.Very enjoyable.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,This course is very challenging and well maintained fairway and greens. Very friendly staff .
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"This is supposed to be a somewhat upscale course. The greens were in pretty decent shape, but the fairways were only so-so (grass wasn't filled in) and the roughs were terrible (weeds, barespots, lack of grass). Also, the bunkers were not in good shape, but at least they are working to fix/modify them by removing the current grass on the slopes of the bunkers in favor of all sand."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"We played in early April and the conditions were surprisingly average compare to other courses. I'm sure it will come in once the weather gets consistent but not up to the level of other local courses. A great place to play, just get out early on the weekends as the course plays slow."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Local courses are starting to come in after the harsh winter. I was a little dissapointed in the greens after playing other courses in the last two weeks which seemed to be in much better shape. Overall conditions were decent just a little off what I was expecting after playing other equally ranked courses this year.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,We played on march 30th. The course was in rough condition as it is early in the year. The greens weren't up to their usual standards and the bunkers need a lot of work.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Greens in great shape with great roll. Fairways clean
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,fall aeration and seeding on fairways and greens. Course in execellent shape under the new ownership. Greens were quick and outstanding.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Great layout and very challenging. Some of the fairways around the greens need attention (spotty lies).
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"not a complaint, just putted off the toe ....like this venue, generous fairways large greens....awesome bunkering...needs to be played again!"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Well maintained. Lots of bunkers. Some,bunkers were so deep they were taller than me (as much as 8 feet)."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Arrived at the course and presented the GolfNow reservation information to the person behind the desk. This was met with questions, mumbling and grumbling about online tee times. Finally we got a key for the cart, went outside to find that the cart DID NOT have GPS as advertised on Golf Now. Asked the gentleman in the office what was the reason and he said the contract of with the GPS provider had expired. ""Sorry"" was the response and that they needed to get that information updated.The course was extremely wet everywhere (apparently insufficient drainage in the course design) with numerous unfilled divots in the fairways."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"For the cost, you won't find a better course in the mid-west. Course conditions are always pristine. Sand traps make this course challenging. GPS on carts is the best no matter where your ball lies."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Played here every year, once or twice each yr. Lots of bunkers, is their trademark. Greens ruled true, fairs/rough all pretty good. Some of those Bunkers could use a little treatment! (I know...don't hit in them)"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,great course....from the tips...super hard...we played the 6400 yds.....and was challenging
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Clubhouse and staff very nice. Too bad there are no sprinklers in the fairways to keep them green. Electric Golf Carts with GPS was nice. Bentgrass in fairways is drying out and dying. Too bad, it is such a beautiful course, the greens are in good shape not great, but good."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Great links style course design. Has lots of bunkers. One suggestion to speed up play would be to cut down the super long rough so players would not spend so much time looking for balls. Four or 5 inches is enough to be penalizing. That would also attract more average players who tend to spray the ball more.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,nice course to try different things on and see how turns out
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"The greens are great, much of the heather has been eliminated but still forces risk/reward. Great shape overall, very friendly and appreciative staff."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,I went to play this course on several friends recommendations. I'm very glad I did. This course was a great challenge. The fairways were in great shape and the undulating greens were fast and true. The shire grass ate more than a few of my playing partners golf balls. This course also has some of the largest and deepest bunkers of any course I have played in Indiana. The sand in them is very well maintained and soft but they are quite intimmidating to look at protecting the sides of the fairways and around the greens. I would recommend this course to anyone looking for a challenge.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Had a good round. Play was a little slow but to be expected in the summer. The fairways were a little ""used"" caught some sketchy lies in the fairway. Overall a good value for the money. I'm sure the course gets a lot of play as its a great layout if you like links style golf."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Geens, fairways good shape,as its been since it opened bunkers need some work sand not consistent. wind always a factor. Over priced at normal door rates"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"A few bunkers had issues with definition and the carts were not very good (both carts died in our group, plus GPS didn't always line up with hole location), but the course was very nice and in good shape."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Course was in very good shape. Sand in bunkers very course, not great for bottom of club head finish. Course was very pleasing but at times challenging to play. Play moved at a very good pace. Right at 4 hrs. including time for a quick bit for lunch."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,I play this course often and it is in great shape right now. I learned it is under new ownership. I hope they take care of the place!
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"The very interesting this course because it is difficult.However, it can not go rarely because you can not book alone. It is a pity."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,The course was very playable. The sand bunkers were not .
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,This course was well maintained especially given all the rain we had several days before. The sand traps are plentiful and I should know because I was in them most of the day!
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Great course and always fun to play! I love how challenging the greens are!
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Would of liked to of had the bathrooms unlocked on course, the ball washers out and the water bins to of had water but other than that the course was really nice, well kept !! Staff was cordial !! Price was just about right.....will defiantly be back !!"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"I'm in Indiana about twice a year and try to play this course at least once. Multiple sets of tees make it enjoyable for all skill levels, playing from the tips on a windy day is not recommended. Greens were a little rough, but only due to the fact that it was November and off season. Fairways were excellent and the rough was low compaired to summer months. Highly recommended to pay a little more and get a quality track like this."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"Pricing structure is high for what you can find at other area courses. My cart could barely make it up some of the hills and would almost crawl at times. Greens were covered in sand (my home course used half as much). Tee boxes were rough. The bunkers however were well maintained compared to other area courses. Fairways seemed OK, though they were soggy in a lot of areas and my ball plugged on 5 holes. Overall, its a challenging course to play, but there are other courses in the area that are challenging for a lot less money."
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,Something must be wrong with the drainage because it had not rained in two days and the course was soaked. Balls were burying in the fairway and rough. I live in the area and my yard was not nearly this wet.
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"A VERY challenging coarse, just like I heard it was!"
The Links at Heartland Crossing,5670-the-links-at-heartland-crossing,"This rolling terrain beast can be slightly difficult to master for the once a month swinger, but it's gorgeous features and well thought out layout makes this course worth all the time spent in the bunkers and all the balls lost from the bag."

Dyes Walk Golf Course,5774-dyes-walk-golf-course,This is the southside of Indianapolis only private club.Course is in good condition and pace of play here is quick.3 hrs 45 minutes for most groups.

Dyes Walk Golf Course,5774-dyes-walk-golf-course,Great membership.
East/South at Old Oakland Golf Club,5810-east-south-at-old-oakland-golf-club,"I was lucky enough to get a invite to play the West-South combination at Old Oakland. If you like doglegs, this is a (private) course for you. Some were subtle, some were 90 degree turns, but almost every non-par 3 hole had some turn to it. Most of them were very tight with mature trees, sand, and some water in play. I felt on some of the holes the neighborhood did encroach a bit, especially where people had chairs and hammocks and such right off the cart path. I did enjoy most of the design though, especially the par 5's which all had great character."
East/South at Old Oakland Golf Club,5810-east-south-at-old-oakland-golf-club,"Conditions-wise the course could've used a tighter mow, especially on some tees. The greens, however were super firm, and pretty fast. Had a hard time stopping any club in the bag that flew to the surface. The sand was easily the best I've played in all year though."
East/South at Old Oakland Golf Club,5810-east-south-at-old-oakland-golf-club,"If you get a chance to play here, it's worth a go. Bring your A-game though as tight OB , woods, water, and lots of other problems await if you spray."
Woodland Country Club,5675-woodland-country-club,"Got to play here (finally) for an outing. Really solid course and conditions, very much indicative of a private club in a major metro area."
Woodland Country Club,5675-woodland-country-club,"Old school course (Bill Diddel, with Pete Dye dabbling) but still very challenging and by no means obscure. A bunch of tough par 3s, strategic bunkers and hazards, plus devious fall-off areas everywhere."
Woodland Country Club,5675-woodland-country-club,"Property isn't wildly hilly or anything, but has some natural features, and architecture does a wonderful job of accenting subtle elevation changes. The course does a great job moving fairways over humps, creating fall-off areas near greens, etc."
Woodland Country Club,5675-woodland-country-club,"Greens were outright deceptive; we got within striking distance all day, but slight movements and hidden features served up massive disappointment for our scramble team. You need to play here a lot to understand the greens."
Woodland Country Club,5675-woodland-country-club,"I've played almost every private course in the area (not all, but I'm trying!); what stands out here is the Top-to-Bottom challenge. What I mean is, this place tests your tee ball, your approach and your putter. I think it really stands out above many more ""heralded"" tracks that trade on prestige and conditions, but end up presenting a boring golf course. Woodland might be a sneaky best-in-class type of place. I loved it and will give it serious consideration as future member."
Woodland Country Club,5675-woodland-country-club,"Great course. Plenty of challenges, but fair. Fairways and greens are excellent, professional staff is friendly and helpful. Love playing this course as I am a member and play over 100 rounds per year."

"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Great layout !Huge greens protected by bunkers.Has water hazard in play.Greens were in good shape and fairly fast.Have played this course for over 40 years and continue.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,The course was in great shape and the pace of play was excellent. We always feel we’ve gotten great value for our $$$. The staff is very helpful and friendly. Would highly recommend.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Looking for a place to play golf , to be shallenged, looking for a spot not too far away? The Links is your new favorite course. Played with Terry Schill on a soggy course due to recent rain but could still drive in the fairways. Live the layout and the super large greens. I like to be challenged by long putts which require a nice lag putt. Come out try it doe yourself.Also they hand make these delicious deli sandwiches to go with your cold beer."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"The staff was soo friendly. It was pretty busy, and the marshal started us, instructing us to wait to go until the group in front got to the first green. I wish more golf courses would do this. It spread everyone out enough to where we weren’t pushing or being pushed."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"The course was in incredible shape and extremely fun to play! If you haven’t played here, give it a try. You won’t be disappointed."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Course should have been closed for at least a day. There was standing water all over the place on every hole. Bad bad playing conditions.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Wish they had a course layout on the score cards. Some holes you have no idea where the tee shot is supposed to go
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"What a pleasure to play a course with wide fairways and huge greens..Every hole is designed to play a particular way, stray off line and it is difficult to score a par.The holes are fair and different so each round is a new adventure.To be fair to those readers who do not like surprises the course is maintained but not groomed.Do not expect fast greens. Fluffy sand or tightly mown fairways. This course suits hookers the best except for number 18.I was paired with a great golfer named Terry SchillHe could really work the ball. I think he shot a 69 on a very windy day.Go enjoy the full bar, handmade sandwiches and NO long waits. Enjoy"
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Nice layout but course was very busy. They were running 1/2 hr behind because they didn’t have enough carts. The people I was playing with couldn’t play the entire round because of the late start. The manager wouldn’t refund or give credit for the 9 holes they couldn’t play because of the late start.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,The course was in great shape for this time of year in Indiana. The greens rolled fast and true. Great Staff!Two nice days in Indiana for Golf!!
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Greens seem to be well maintained and are large and have interesting features, such as shape, undulations and placement. The course layout is good for the price point and features nice doglegs with fairway bunkers and water hazards on several holes. The staff are super friendly and accommodating and make you feel welcome."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"My biggest issue with the course is the fairways. They are very hard and not well maintained. The dry conditions at the time I played probably made this more noticeable but even still I felt it was more on par with a dirt cheap place where u pay 15 bucks to ride. The bunkers were also not well maintained, and extremely compacted. This is pretty common on mid tier courses tho and not a huge problem but still annoying."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Overall a nice layout and nice people, but subpar fairways."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Bunkers are like concrete and filled with rocks and the greens definitely needed rolled or mowed. Extremely slow greens. Other than those two things the course was an absolute blast. Would and will play again. A layout that requires some creativity, a good short game, and control with the big stick."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,This course was in great shape. The staff was extremely friendly. It was busy and they had a marshal starting everyone. They made you wait until the group in front got on the 1st tee. I wish all courses would do that. It really helped the pace of play.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,I just wanted to spend time outside on a quiet course with no houses....The Links was an obvious choice.Played with Terry Schill and enjoyed watching him fire a 71 in brutal wind. Highlight of the round was a 5wood into the wind from 170 yards finishing two inches from the hole for kick in birdie.Excellent layout. Large greens and favors a hook ball flight.Reasonable. Friendly golf facility.enjoyed every minute.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Lack of rain is an issue as greens & fairways are suffering. Sand traps are rock hard. Broke several tees trying to put the ball on the tee stations due to hardness of the ground. Clubhouse staff is welcoming & friendly and that helps make it better.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Don’t play here! Save your time, tee boxes are beat up, staff is rude, and they don’t offer water around the course."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Overall nice course for the money. Biggest complaint is no hole layouts either on the scorecard or the hole signs by the tee box.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"No lunch food options like hot dogs, just snacks stuff."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Took over 5 hours to play a round No marshal to speed up rate of play. Once expressing this those in charge blew complaint off.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,These course conditions seem to get worse every year. The greens are burnt out. The community doesn’t help repair pitch marks. The fairways and tee boxes are atrocious. The club doesn’t even supply sand to repair divots (not that people would). For 40 dollars I would go somewhere else.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"I’ve played this course over 50 times in the last 3 years. It’s was considered “going downhill” 3 years ago and has only gotten worse. This course was 5 minutes from my house and I’d drive up to 30 minutes away to play elsewhere for the same price. There are a couple good ol boys in the clubhouse but there’s a grumpy old man who ruins it for everyone. Talks to people like crap, snaps his fingers at you. Once threw a cart key at my playing partner. The course layout is great, one of my favorites. However, the tee boxes are junk. I love the large greens but they are undoubtedly some of the slowest in the state. The fairways are junk and there have been no signs of repair. No starter. Pace of play is a joke."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Good overall experience. Good to see trash being emptied at holes and friendly staff. Greens were in great shape. Fairways and tees were very dry…no much evidence of watering though cups on greens were moats all half full of water!
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"The fairways on this course were nearly as long as the rough, and the greens were slower than putting through mud"
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"This was a. Pristine course, needs some real love to get it back to what it use to be"
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Tight course. Felt like other groups were playing on top of each other
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,A beautiful layout. Plenty of bunkers and water to cause you some trouble. This course needs work though. The fairways are in bad shape and the course overall needs care. Great range and practice facilities. Worth the drive to check it out for yourself. Hopefully the course will return to it's former glory.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"It had rained the night before so the bunkers were hard packed but still playable, fairways still had some roll and greens were soft but in good shape. Pace of play was super fast since the course was not busy, my wife and I played in 2 hours and 50 minutes."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"The layout was nice, some tight tee shots and plenty of bunkers. Greens were slow and being the first time I played it, would be beneficial to provide some hole descriptions on hole boards or something."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Let me start by saying this course could one day be very nice. The layout is good and my buddy hit out of multiple bunkers and stated they were all in decent shape. However, tee box to green this course is in pretty rough shape. The greens are patchy and seriously long. It looked like nobody had mowed the course in a week. Tee boxes were overgrown and filled with weeds. Fairways were barely distinguishable from the rough. The greens on this course are so incredibly slow that they're almost unplayable. I was smashing putts that would go 35 feet on a normal green for 10 footers. It was like putting on a shag carpet. If I was going uphill I almost needed a wedge. Maybe I caught this course on a bad week, but my group as a whole was so upset with the conditions that we didn't even finish the round. I will not return for at least a year and it would be hard to get me back at all. Layout is good. Bunkers are okay. Fairways are bad. Greens and tee boxes are absolutely terrible."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"This is a decent course for the money. It probably won’t overwhelm you anywhere, but it’s a generally fair test."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"A solid course, only had to wait because of bad golfers in front of us. Overall great value for the price"
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,I love this course this is my 4th time playing now and it’s always a good time. The pace was pretty slow but that was only because an elderly foursome wouldn’t let us play through the whole back 9
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Good course layout. Speed of play was good for most holes. Tee boxes need some TLC along with fairways in certain areas. Overall, good course for the money."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"I came here just to hit some golf balls at the range with my brother. I walk in wearing a tank top and cargo shorts. An old man at the counter rang me up and I headed outside to get my baskets filled with balls to hit. I hit 200 balls and let me tell you, they will gouge you for those free balls they get. 9 freaking dollars for 50 balls!? Now for the really fun part. I'm practicing my short game on the putting green and the SAME boomer who rang me up starts biting my head off about wearing a tank top and yelling at me telling me I cant put on that green. Apparently there was a very small sign facing away from the green I was on, so of course I cant see it. This guy has the audacity to ask if I can read!!! No guy, I cant read the sign that is facing away from my eye balls, sorry I don't have x-ray vision to see through the sign and read it backwards. Check out the google reviews, this old boomer is causing a lot of negativity for this course so you should probably kick him to the curb or he should just retire, On top of all of that, the course looked like an unattended back yard with weeds and dirt patches everywhere. The sand pits were full of mud, the rough was so long theres no way people are finding their balls if they hit the rough. Fairways are patchy and brown, same with the greens. I understand dress codes, but y'all let me pay and hit golf balls for 2.5 hours before you said anything. This course is in a very small town, its a dump, and for those reasons it does not warrant a dress code for customers simply hitting some balls at the range. What a joke of a course. People leaving 5 star reviews or anything above 3 stars are high, or have never been to a real golf course. Never coming back, never giving them another penny. If I were you I would stay far far away."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Ok course in need of some updates and a little TLC
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Love the course layout ... greens were pretty rough shape and course doesn't drain well, but got a hot deal and it was less than $20 PP, so cannot beat that deal. Bunkers not really playable. Overall good value."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Great value. Course layout was beautiful and pace was great.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Always a nice course to play on and for a very good price! Will return again
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"My wife and I wanted a round of golf on Sunday afternoon that was affordable. The Links delivered in spades. For the money, it was outstanding. The layout is really nice and presents a challenge for an above average golfer. The par fives are long. Trees line the fairways on several holes and there is also holes that are fairly open. The greens are large, but are undulating so you can get pretty tough two putt opportunities. The fairways could be manicured better. The greens are slow and a little ragged. This course has potential to be incredibly nice. I will be back."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"I got this round for $16 for 18 and cart on a hit deal. So, know it’s not the local country club $100 round. For the price, cart worked just fine, had a driving range, greens actually in pretty good shape, maybe above avg to a lot of other played courses, the fairways and tee boxes are just mowed shorter fescue , Rye, and crab. It’s not great but again, for the price…. The layout, a blast. Hardly any hole is dead straight so some fun there to shape the shots. For the price, it’s definitely a good value!"
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Giant smooth greens with a lot of undulations.Only roughy spot were the tee boxes ( no big deal ! )
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Staff was awesome!Clean clubhouse. Clean restroom.Course was great with no trash lying around.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"We stopped playing on #13 after following 2 foursomes for FOUR hours! Greens were hard and crusty. Fairways were inconsistent and rough was very inconsistent. Thick, thin, bare. I live nearby but will drive anywhere else to play."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"had a twosome behind us hit the green while we were putting,they then pulled up and walked up to us saying he works here and not to park our cart no closer than 30 ft. from the green,i asked him if was on the clock working ,he said no.if you are a ranger working that day is one thing but this totally uinacceptable,my playing partner is 86 has had cancer and wears a bag,"
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"My group of three enjoyed this golf course very much. We are very average golfers who average 95-110. The course was difficult enough to make for some challenging shots but also had a good amount of room for error if a shot went wide. The staff was awesome, the price is great, and the weather was perfect.My one complaint is not with the golf course but with the pace. We got slowed down quite a bit where we were waiting 10-15 after finishing a hole before we could start teeing off.Overall, I highly recommend you gift this fantastic golf course a try."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"the mower man is rude and hateful,last year he yelled at us for parking the cart not on the cart path,he then persisted to cut grass for the next 2 holes close to us while we were teeing off purposely just be purposely annoying,this year yesterday he was cutting the grass on the tee boxes while we were trying to play that hole,when he saw our disapproval he did it on other tee boxes as we approached those holes,being a deliberate jerk,most courses we play the mowers move out of the way and shut the mowers off,not this guy he needs fired"
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Played after a few days of rain so cart path only for us which was fine as we are all healthy.The traps were too wet to play so we opted to lay out. The greens are quite large and conducive to paying attention to speed.Nice layout and a challenge if you play the correct tees. If you drive it around 200 yards, play the green ters and have fun.Played with Mr. TERRY SCHILL and marveled at his pure ballstriking. At his age, he amazed me at his distance and accuracy. He loved the layout and encouraged us to play the course as designed and stay away from sucker pins. All in all a great day. There is a driving range, a practice area and a unique putting green actually attached to number 19 green. Pretty cool.Also the hot dogs are huge and decently priced.Go play!!"
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Too many issues to even start. Course is not maintained at all.......
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Love playing links. Great course and great place to play.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,The course has a good layout. Tee boxes were not good. Greens were fine. Pace of play was slow-one foursome clogged up the whole course..
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"I last played here about 5 years agoI like the layout and course is fun to play with huge greens - so 3 putts will rear their head, especially when they are as slow as the greens are now. Lots of areas on the greens are burnt up. disappointing fairways - no way to play the ball down and crabgrass rough,"
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Enjoyed it a lot. Great very friendly staff. Tee boxes could be better.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"I used to play here often so I gave it a shot again. But disappointed in course condition . Weeds everywhere, fairways spotty at times."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"This was the first time that I've played this course in over 30 years. The course has a nice layout, and it is not very long. The greens are huge and were rolling fast for all of the rain they received over the weekend. The staff at the clubhouse was very friendly. I will definitely not wait another 30 years to play the Links again!"
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,I had not been here in a couple of years. The course was in great shape. The staff was very nice and friendly.This was the first real warm day of the year. First day it reached in the 80’s so it was packed. It was very slow. At one point we were second in line at a tee box with another group waiting behind us.This wasn’t the fault of the course as it was extremely busy today.Great place to play. I’ll be back for sure!
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,The course was beautiful! I loved the layout of the back 9! The course is a little less forgiving than most but still a good course for beginners! Highly recommend going!
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"For $20, I didn't expect a course with so much water and excellent bunkers. Fairways are tight, and the back 9 was particularly challenging. It's just too bad that my front lawn is cleaner than the fairways on the course."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Only reason I went is because it was $11. Even at that price, it was not worth dealing with THE MOST RUDE CLUBHOUSE STAFF I HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED!!! Tried to explain my situation to the staff, and explain that they have ALWAYS accommodated me in the past, but the staff member was having a bad day so he REFUSED to listen, even tried to lie saying there was a new policy that started in April (not knowing that I have been here a couple times since April) and then proceeded to say he would call the cops instead of calling and asking his boss if he could accommodate. Long story short, he did end up calling his boss and the boss ended up being a reasonable man and he instructed his employee to accommodate me. This was a long drawn out process tho, and in the process, said staff member called me a jerk, an a** and said I must not be able to read, among other things that I will not repeat. HAVE NEVER ENCOUNTERED SUCH RUDE STAFF IN MY ENTIRE LIFE. Thank you to the owner for being reasonable. But please fire said employee ASAP. He will not inspire golfers to come back."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Always friendly service at this course! The greens were in great shape, although some of the cups need to be replaced so the flag pole will stand up straight. Great price on GolfNow!"
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,The course was in a much better shape then last year. Greans were average speed but rolled true. Beautiful day and look forward to playing again.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"First time playing at this course, and it did not disappoint. I got a great deal through golf now(13$ for 18 holes). The course is well maintained and can be pretty challenging at times. Staff was friendly"
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Used to play this course several times a year 1st time this year. Course has declined immensely, tee boxes barely had grass, fairways were more weeds than grass, greens torn up because golfers not repairing ball marks, and got splinters from a bunker rake that looked older than I am. Very disappointing to see the course like this as I used to like playing there"
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Recent heavy rains got the rough cut behind but overall a good course to play if you like a challenge. The course has areas that need a little TLC but for the value of the green fees some things can be overlooked. Had a great time at a four half hour pace.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Played on a Friday late morning. Not a lot of people on the course yet. The front nine was the best part of the course. Tee boxes and fairways were in good shape. Considering how much rain we’ve had, the greens were very dry. The back nine needs quite a bit of work. A little pricey for the conditions."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,This course will get better as the weather dries out. They are weeks behind on the mowing. It has been to wet to get to most of the rough and it is really rough. Most fairways and tee boxes were mowed . The greens were large and in good shape. I feel they will get caught up in the next few weeks. We enjoyed the layout and will come back later in the year when they have had time to mow.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"The price was right, and the cart was like new. There was no one pushing us and we didn't have to wait on anyone very often. However, the course was in awful condition. The fairways were poor, the greens were poor and very slow, and the tee boxes were poor. The only reason I played this course is because it was the only GolfNow ""hot deal"" I could get at this time of the day (2:45 pm). I needed this time because my son was visiting me, and couldn't arrive earlier. There are a lot of nice courses in the Indy area. This isn't one of them."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Links has a fun layout and a lot of holes that play at angles and tempt you to cut corners over trees and water. Greens are big and nuanced. Unfortunately we played after a week of on and off rain that probably kept the mowers off the course all week. Lots dandelions and overgrown rough, and if only the bunkers had sand in them. Overall, not bad but also expected for $25. Hopefully they can get the course back in good shape because it is a really strong layout."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Disappointed that it was cart path only because of pooling water from rain on the course. Fairways not in very good shape. Large greens Ok. Pace of play very good. Flat course, but several water hazards and many sand traps. Because of our golf now price, it was still a good value for 2 of us."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"I've played this course through the years. Expansive greens and a good layout. Average conditions. Tee boxes had bare spots and weeds but acceptable in most places. Fairways needed mowed and had bare patches and were looking rough in places. Greens were extremely hairy, long, and slow. However they were in good condition relatively and the best part of the course. Pin positions looked to be in the same spot since last month, but were in tough approaches. It was very wet so we didn't play in the bunkers, but they seemed to be in good shape. A great deal for the rate we paid, but seems to be lacking in overall maintenance for the year end. I'd go back for sure, but not spend a lot doing it.."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"I'm a regular at the Links. Overall, it's a decent course for the money...only $30 for 18 during peak hours. It's definitely not The Fort. The course could use some TLC in the sand traps and tee boxes; fairways were a little rough today...usually they cut it pretty course."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Great staff, pro shop and snack bar personnel were friendly, helpful and top notch. Rest of course is really bad. Tees and fairways and roughs are full of weeds and crabgrass. Landscape timbers lining cart paths had rotted in several places it looks like the course has had minimal maintenance money spent on it in the past year. Sad, as layout could be challenging and greens have potential."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"We enjoyed our round of golf. There were only a few other golfers so we finished in 3 1/2 hours. The fairways were in good shape and the greens were ok. I visited several traps and trees and lakes. The course is not as pretty as other courses, without any hills, but it was a good value. We hope to play there again."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"This course needs some work, primarily the tee boxes and sand traps. I was the first one on the course today and had a great time! I was able to play in a little over 3 hours. For $30, the Links isn't a bad track...it was definitely worth the money!"
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"The course is fun to play. Huge greens! They are in decent shape. Cut a little high, but could be because of the hot weather. Fairways and rough needs some good TLC. Too many weeds."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,This course could easily be great with a little work.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Played ina twosome, tee boxes need work and the rough is full of weeds. Greens are exyremely slow."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"I was the second person on the course, so the pace of play was extremely quick. The mowing crew was out, so the course was in pretty good condition overall. It's definitely not The Fort...but it was only $30 too. The bunkers needs new sand; most are hard pan. A few of the tee boxes need work as well. But overall, it isn't bad."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"I played there a couple years ago and it was pretty decent. So with that said I couldn’t tell you how disappointed I am that this place has gone down hill so much. The tee boxes are trash. The rough looks like it hasn’t been touched all year. And the bunkers are just dirt, no sand what so ever. I wouldn’t recommend you waste your time going to this course til they do a lot of work getting it back in shape."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,The staff at this course should be embarrassed with he condition of the course. Rough probably hasn’t been cut in a month on most holes. Regardless of the price the conditions are awful.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,The course is in brutally awful shape. It's honestly hardly playable. Expect to lose loads of balls as the rough is not well groomed and dead grass everywhere makes it impossible to find your ball.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"This place has never been the best but I expected a little more effort. Dandelions everywhere! Grass over a foot deep! Finally saw a lawnmower and the guy was cutting the grass by the parking lot. They should be embarrassed. Never will go back ,the large greens didn’t even hold a sandwiedge. This place has to be weeks from bankruptcy."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Weeds and dirt everywhere! Greens and fairways have weeds throughout and the roughs are literally nothing but weeds. Many bunkers weren’t even full of sand. Glad I only paid $10 to play. Layout was enjoyable. This would be a good course with even average maintenance!
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"The Links has been my go-to course for several years now. The staff is always great, the course is typically in good condition. This past Sunday was no exception. The only thing they could really improve is the condition of the bunkers. They could really some new sand. It's definitely not the nicest course in Indy, but it's solid."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,The course layout is great. I play it about once a year and the condition gradually declines each year We played on a great weather day and when we started and when we left there were about a dozen cars in the parking lot. I’m sure that they do the best that they can on the budget they have to work with. It’s sad to see a once great course in this condition
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Course has great staff always friendly and raedy to help. After playing this course more than 20 times I can say I have never had one problem with this course. Play move very good on this course.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Not in bad shape overall, for the weather we have had leading up to 3/18/18. Bunkers HAVE sand in them which is not true of most of the Other courses we have played since last Fall. Need some growing weather for greens and fairways grass's."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Leaves around makes it hard to find balls in the middle of the fairway. Using the golf now app cheap round of golf the greens were in good shape no aeration until spring
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"I know the course doesn’t drain well. But, cart path only this Friday was silly. I don’t remember seeing a single puddle."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"However, gosh I love playing this course.16 is just my favorite hole. Have to hit a solid tee shot.Giant greens - it’s just a great layout."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"This is the fourth or fifth time I’ve played this course this year. While I really enjoy the layout of the course and some of the holes are really challenging, the course maintenance is constantly below par. Would love to see groundskeepers do some work on the Fairways and rough."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Drove down from Fishers. Guy checking me in was very friendly which is appreciated. Love the layout of the course. It was definitely firm and fast. Course needs some maintenance here and there, but the playability of the course is good. Definitely worth the drive."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Really nice course has some challenges with the water and sand but enjoy playing it!!!
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Course was in fairly good condition greens are big and the greens were in nice condition
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Great place to work on your putting game. Can't wait to go back.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"We all enjoy the course layout. Fairways are wide enough for the average golfer, but enough trouble if you get off the fairways to make it a challenge. This is the fourth time I've played the course this year.Wish the course maintenance, particularly the roughs was a little better. The roofs are particularly uncut probably 5 to 6 inches long. Makes it very difficult for the average golfer to dig the ball out on the shot. All that said, it is still well worth the money."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"This course is always in great shape. Greens are huge, rough isn't bad at all( I should know) and fairways in great condition. I prefer the rough because that's what I'm use to. Try it and you will like it."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Played here on 29 Jul for the full rate and was very disappointed. The rough on all of the holes is pretty well 80% weeds and many of them little white top ones which is a pain when looking for your ball. They also seem to don't believe in mowing the rough. The bunkers were basically unplayable as they were just dirt (as others have posted).
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,A Marshall was riding around on the course but seemed to do nothing to help the pace of play. The round was 5 hours 15 minutes which is rather ridiculous with someone on the course monitoring. A set of tees at around 6000 yards would do a lot to speed up play as the only options are 5600 or 6400 and it seems many people play 6400 when they shouldn't. We made our own hybrid set (mix of back and middle) to have it play around 6100.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"I wish Golf Now would let us know in advance if a course is cart path only, before we book a round."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Then we'd have the option to either pass on playing there, or decide to bring a push cart, as the round would play much faster than cart path only, with very little difference in the mileage walked."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Despite the week before having beautiful weather, there was a some rain the day before we played. But I hardly expected the course to be cart path only. If we had known, I probably would not have chosen to play here. There were many other choices in this area."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"I have played this course many times before, and I like the layout, but this was the first time it's ever been cart path only."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Once we got there and found out it was cart path only, I first was irked at GolfNow, but then was kicking myself for not bringing our push carts, as the course doesn't offer them as an option to riding carts."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,The round took almost 5-1/2 hours. We would have rather had our push carts and just walked.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,The course was soggy and the bunkers were loaded with water.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"In the future, before I book a round with GolfNow, I will call the course and find out restrictions before I book."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"First, I love this course and its layout. I have played here since it opened. The design is finally coming together. Yet, all the sand traps are not filled with sand. They are nothing but ""dirt traps"". If u choose to save money but not keeping the course properly maintained, remove all the traps. We want sand not hard dirt."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"This place is a joke! Ball washers with nothing in them. No water jugs out in their locations, no sand in the sand traps. This course could be a real gem if some money was put into it! I wouldn't pay more than $18 with cart, the way it is now."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Played this course many times. Greens were dry, hard, fast, and undulating. More dry spots and areas on the course overall than usual and should be ground under repair. Windy day and greens that wouldn't hold made for some tough chipping, putting, and approach conditions and the balls would roll right through the greens. Big greens and big breaking putts. Some tall rough in areas to stay out of!"
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Nice layout,and I enjoy playing out there every time we go… I've played this course over 20 years and the greens and fairways are large and forgiving .based on the time of year comparably is always in good shape for Indiana!! Absolutely would recommend !!"
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Played there a few times last year, conditions were actually really good for mid February. Greens are gigantic, plenty of water and sand traps to challenge the average player without being impossible to play"
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,For a round in Feb this was ok. Tee boxes are not marked so it made it difficult and the holes have no signage indicating which hole you are on or the distance.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Staff was very helpful and friendly. Greens and fairways were in great shape. We will be back to play again.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Very good course and it's in pretty good shape for the time of season. The greens aren't all consistent but this course will challenge you a bit.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,The course layout is very good. The greens where very fast. There is no sand in the sand traps and it was ridiculous trying to get out of the hard clay mud traps. A 6pack of beer is the outer space price of $24.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"My biggest complaint about this course was that there were not any hole layouts on any of the holes. Especially for the first time playing, made it difficult to figure out where the pins/bunkers/hazards were because every hole was dog leg left/right"
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Not a bad deal if you get a hot deal. But I would pass if had to pay full rate. Many of the greens are scared and have disease issues, crab grass and weeds for rough.... Course has a lot of potential, it shows this course is being run on the cheap. I live within 5 miles and will pass on this course to pay as much or more to play better quality."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Great value - course was deceptively long more so on back 9 holes. Nice layout with enough trees and water to keep you honest. Course conditions were a Little rough - this is not a CC level course with some thin spots on the greens and crab grass / weeds off of the fairways but overall an enjoyable round for the price. Will definitely play here again.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"This course has a lot of mature trees plenty of water and sand. A small creek winds it's way around and through the course and will sneak up on you if you are not familiar with it. The sand was wet and flooded from a rain but are strategically placed and hides the fairway beyond in places. It was hot and humid the day I played, but it was still fun to play and I will be playing it again soon."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"I believe I wrote a review, but feel compelled to write another. I was from out of town, by myself and paid an extremely cheap rate to play (thanks to golfnow). However, I was treated like a member. The gentleman in the pro shop even walked me outside and told me everything I needed to know to play the course. That's true customer service."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,This is a very nice course. A hidden gem. It was my 1st time there so the pro shop person took me outside to show and let me know some things about the course. Super friendly. Wish I lived closet. I would play often. Probably would be my home track.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,I played alone and reserved through a Hot Deal = $10 for 18 and a cart. Can't beat that price. It was 90 degrees when I played so the fairway/greens played fast with the hard ground. One complaint I had is the water jug from hole to hole was empty on most of them. I would play again.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Very friendly staff and an excellent course for the money.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Played 18 and the round was very nice. Perfect upper 60's. A lot of rain this week, but they did a good job in the fairways, tee boxes and greens. The grass in the rough was taller than usual, as they probably couldn't get in there to mow. I really like the layout. Greens were very large."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"not in to bad of shape better then last year,would play again,bunkers could use a little love"
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Course was in pretty good shape considering it was the end of March in Indiana. What also very windy and a little chill in the air, but playing golf in this state in March its okay."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Course was in good shape for the time of year.Staff was friendly.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"For the time of year, the course was in good condition. The greens had recently been aerated, so putting was more difficult."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Greens are large. Tee boxes need some work. Sand traps are lacking a good amount of sand.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,I would definitely play the course again.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"This course has a ton of potential. Looks like they dreamed big in some places (some tee boxes built but don't seem to be currently used, they would give options to certain holes). That's not a criticism, it's a ton of maintenance. Course is ok. Both times I've played the greens have been SLOW SLOW SLOW. mid August was the previous so I know it isn't just that it's getting later in the season. Overall pretty good. People were friendly."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Really enjoyed the day! Very friendly staff. Tee boxes, fairways and big greens were in great shape. Sand traps were in good shape. Great weather made it a very enjoyable day."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Overall well-maintained. Some challenging holes. Played here several times; always one of the courses considered when deciding where to play.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"This course has changed dramatically since it was built. The trees have grown, so on many holes a poor drive can lead to a bogie. The Links has very large greens, so be prepared for some 70 - 100 foot putts! It was nice to play a course that had adequate sand in their bunkers."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"This course has very bad upkeep/maintenance. The greens are in poor shape, the bunkers are awful. They don't mow often. It's a golf course run ""on the cheap"". For the regular rack rate you are much better off to go someplace else. For 4 or 5 bucks more you will have much more fun at any of the well maintained golf course in the area."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Rough covered in weeds. Some herbicide and grass seed might help in a few years!
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"I haven't played here in about 5 years. We just finished the wettest month in history so I expected lush conditions with a few flooded areas that need repairs. The fairways were as if they hadn't been watered in a year, the greens were very hard and rough, and the traps hadn't been raked in months. I would hate to see it in a drought year. Having said that, it was a bargain for theGolfnow hot price of just over $14. Had I paid full price, I would have been jumping up and down. I guess I got value for my dollar, I wouldn't pay more but for $14,it is what it is."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Walked off the course after 11 holes due to brutally slow play first nine was 2 1/2 hours but next two holes took an hour. Had 3 groups backed up to tee off of the Par-3 12th.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"We played this course in the afternoon after the morning rush on Saturday. Scheduled to tee off at the same time as another group but it looked like two groups we scheduled at that time. It took 20 minutes to tee off after everyone finally cleared out. This Course was extremely dry. Tee Boxes, Fairways, had not been watered. The Greens were in rough shape. A few tee boxes were blocked off because of rotten steps which deteriorated over years of lack of maintenance. This Course could be a beautiful course. I have played it before, it was better then but not by much. I look forward to playing this when they have taken the time to put this course back in proper shape."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"The course is fairly beat up and patchy from tee to green. It gives the vibes of financial trouble as things were not mowed, greens were very beat up, and several ponds were full of scum. 17 green had a giant sand patch in the middle of it. All the greens were choppy though they rolled ok. Sure they may have struggled with the weather recently, but it seems like they have a lot deeper issues going on. As for pace of play, the majority of the clientele are on social security, so they move at their pace."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Overall, the hot deal price looks nice, but it's just not worth the trip unless some money is put into maintenance."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Enjoyed playing a course where the pace of play was good and we could play at our pace without being pushed. Had fun
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Out T Time was for 2pm. 1st tee was backed up with two foursomes ahead of us. Finally teed off at 2:25 and didnt the first hole till 2:40 waiting on green to clear. Got a little faster after that but Still took almost 3 hours to play front 9 with alot of waiting between shots, so we didnt finish the round. No ranger around to Keep things moving. Lucky we only paid $25 thanks to GolfNow discount or it would've been a real waste. This course has a great layout and if it was better maintained it could be one of the best courses in greater Indy area."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Slow pace of play and poor golf etiquette. Also, confirmed that afterwards with someone else who had played the course. Was cart path only, but players in front would walk to ball, back to cart to get club and then go back and hit next shot. We played a par 3 after they finished it. finished our Par 3 and went to next tee box. They were still on tee box."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Course has really went down hill. Used to be decent but no more
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Course management is extremely required. Don't be too aggressive in crossing water hazard..tight fairways with greens protected by well placed bunkers.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,course was in fairly good shape and greens and fairways were rolling good. Glad to see their mowers had blades sharpened and course was better manicured than last few times I played course.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,This course has a lot of character and will challenge you.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,I had high hopes but this one fell short. Upon arrival we were warned that there was a lot of course maintenance going on and that the price would be going up later this year. Unless it SIGNIFICANTLY improves I would not pay more or go back. The greens are so soft and slow you have to muscle most putts. And good luck finding a yardage marker. We saw maybe 5 all day. There is no discription or layout map of the holes on the card or the tee box. The drinking water basins had cups but no water. Why tease with cups? Not a good day. The flow wasnt managed either. A foursome ahead of us wouldnt let a single pass on the last 7 holes so it went from a steady pace to waiting 5 min on every hole.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Course was in pretty good shape for this time of year. Love the layout, tight fairways and well guarded greens but leaves enough opportunities to recover so a few stray shots won't ruin your day"
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"It is a tough course, roughs were a little long and when you golf like I do you spend a lot of time in them. Greens beautiful and big. Lots of sand and water that were very well taken care. We were not able to do the back nine as we got rained out, but I will go back soon and finish."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"The staff was friendly and accomadating and the course seemed to be fairly maintained, however, it's not a course that one should pay more that 15-18 bucks on a weekday 25 bucks tops on weekend. I was disappointed with the price especially with the decline in the number of rounds being played these days. This was not a value at all- even using Golfnow-I'd suggest knowing what you are getting into before you purchase a round and take a friend."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Tight fairways leads to a shot makers course plenty of hazards also
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,I enjoy this course very much. It is difficult but fun to play
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"This is a very well kept course. It definitely plays like a links style course, fairways are great, but if you get in the rough it is thick! Greens are very big, with a lot of movement. Always enjoy this course!"
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Played from middle tees which would be close to white tees on most courses. There are doglegs on many of the holes, making it a difficult club choice on most drives off the tees. I personally did not use my driver once the whole round, and was not really hurt (I hit 220 to 240 on drives). The greens have almost all false fronts, making the choice of clubs on approach shots challenging to say the least. Over all it was a fun and thoughtful round of golf, and one that would be better after playing several rounds."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"The course has a great layout with some challenging holes. Greens are large and undulating.Distances were well marked on the cart paths but in the fairway it was difficult to find a distance.Nice course.Players, Please repair your ball marks on this nice course. It is our responsibility to keep it nice."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,not a long course...but position off the tee a must....gps would be nice...lots of dog legs...over all a nice venue
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Good layout but not kept in good condition.slow bumpy greens.5 hours to play 18 holes
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"It was a ride-&-stroll in the country too pleasant to be ruined by my poor play. The large, undulating greens were interesting without being punishing.Despite recent heavy rain, the course had drained quite well. Only a few sand traps were still wet."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Nice course. Huge greens. If it was maintained it could be a great course
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"I was blown away by the layout; very challenging layout. Lots of blind shots to narrow landing areas. Every hole seems to be a dogleg left, which makes for a grind of a round for me. Really would love to see this course have some money pumped into it; it could be a top course in the state with the layout. It's not in poor shape; just not great. Very average shape. Worth a trip if you like challenging layouts."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,very fun course greens are big and very good shape have play other courses for a lot more money and not as good
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,the course looks nice pulling into the parking lot. nice use of trees and tall grasses. Its all downhill from there. the ground is hard clay. the fairways and greens are very bumpy and thin. the collars and fringe are diseased. they had aerated a few weeks back. weather in the area would have allowed for better recovery as it has at other courses. but they never top dressed. and the soil is hard and clay filled. I wont be back.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,I have played The Links twice in the last month and consider it one of the hidden gems in the entire Indianapolis metro area. It is a beautifully maintained property with great visual interest and interesting course layout. It is easily one of the best courses I have played in the past several years.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"I had never played this course or even knew it existed, but thanks to Golf Now... was able to experiment and go there for a great price. The course is well laid out and fun to play. It has a evenly spaced group of tee boxes for all skill levels and enough bunkers to aggravate some players. I thoroughly enjoyed my day there and look forward to playing there again this year."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Great Course!! However, was a little disappointed in the Fact that there was no hole layout on the scorecards nor at the tee boxes to give you an idea of how the hole is laid out. Good to go with someone that has played here a few times to give you idea on how to approach each hole from tee to green...."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Pace of play was great. Very few bad lies in fairways. Greens were watered and putted predictably.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"If you have to interact with the pro Pat your visit here will be cold and unwelcoming. The course itself is enjoyable and reasonably priced, but once you deal with Pat you won't want to come back."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,The course was in good shape. Twosome played through quickly without delays.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"A friend of mine that uses GolfNow has been playing this one a lot recently so I decided to go check it out with him. The Hot Deal price was outstanding for this course. The course had a nice layout, fairways were well maintained but rock, and the greens were reasonably fast. I enjoyed this course and thought it was a great value."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,Very very wet had some rain but this course does not drain weel have played before and same problem would not play again unless it had not rain for 5-7 days
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Hmmm.... Funny how my first review of the Links did not get posted- so I 'll try again. All you need to know is they had Golfnow TeeTimes during their Wed morning Men's League. Not sure why....That was clearly not a good idea. After a few holes I came on 6 or 7 foursomes and was completely stopped. Would have been a 6 hour round, so I left. Bottomline...go elsewhere-you can do better at any price...."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,It was a nice small town public course. Big greens that have some nice contours and were fairly quick. Course was well maintained and it was a great deal for the money.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,I would play it again.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,THE GOLF COURSE WAS IN GOOD SHAPE WITHE THE GREENS A LITTLE BUMPY.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Course requires a good grass cutting off the main fairway. Extremely high grass. Appears to not have been cut in over a week. Fairways and greens were OK. Some green had bare spots. I have played this course in past years, when it was maintained much better. This course has a nice layout but is in need of maintenance, at this time."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,I played this course for the first time in over 15 years. The course was in good shape with the exception of Poeanna in many of the greens. Other than that the course well maintained and a challange for most players.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"I enjoyed my round. As the weather warms, this course will be a great place to spend 4 hours. The staff is friendly and the course can challenge all skill levels."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Only one set of tees was available, but the course was still playable and interesting. Despite a short wait on the first tee, play moved at a good pace. Conditions made sand shots almost unplayable, and the greens were a bit bumpy, but that's to be expected this early in the season. We'll try it again in the summer."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,the only thing i did not like about the course is they where airating the greens so the puts where not accurate. to many bunps and they did not wrake up the plugs. other than that the course and staff where very nice and friendly.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"The course has a great layout with some challenging holes. Greens are large and undulating. There were areas of the course where the grass was a little sparse and some areas that held water. Distances were well marked on the cart paths but in the fairway it was difficult to find a distance. Overall, nice course."
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,If you would like a course that is easy and get a low score go here. Golf cart was very junky. Time for some new ones. ha
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,great layout. great deal. greens recently aereated and a little ruff but still a great deal. Staff is great.
"Links Golf Club, The",5896-links-golf-club-the,"Enough challenge for the average golfer from the back tees, making some 400 yard par 4's. Mixture of trees and links-style to make it interesting. Greens in very good shape. Bunkers could use some attention and some good quality sand. Pro shop people cordial and accomodating. Would play again. Well worth it."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Great course to really prepare for course management. Have to play strategy and I love that.Excellent condition course as well.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Course in great shape and staff were very nice and helpful.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,I had a work emergency and had to access wifi and delay our start. Staff in the cafe and the club house were wonderful and our 18 holes of golf went great!
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Brookshire was in good shape with good fairways and greens. Greens were slow but it’s a public course. Nice club house and friendly staff. GREAT COURSE for the cost. Great Bank for the Buck!
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Players don’t fix ball marks on greens. Cart display triggers at least twice a hole with cautions/warnings requiring you to reset by touching.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Overpriced for course condition/layout. No cart beverage service on a HOT day. There are better courses for less $$ all over Indy
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,This place is ran so poorly. They need new management and a staff that actually cares about their job. Restrooms are non existent on the course. They also close the clubhouse way before people are even done golfing which is mind blowing to me. If people are out there golfing and it’s day light your employees should be working. Save your money and don’t support golf courses who treat their customers like this.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,This course is tight and has a lot of doglegs. A good app for course layout and distances recommended
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Great afternoon/ eve of golf. Somewhat humid, but not bad. Good pace of play. No waiting in front or behind. Some blind holes, water hazards and trees kept it challenging but fun."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Rack rate is $63 for this course. Its a $40 course. It was in good shape. I really like the layout, and the staff was very friendly. Greens rolled true. It was fairly easy, but offered some challenging holes. Lots of places to lose golf balls. Nice practice greens. I can see potential for a very slow round here, but we played a twilight. I'd play it again."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Played the front nine (wish we had time for a full 18!) and had a great time. We thought the course had interesting holes with mature trees and creek winding through several holes. Will differently come back in future.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Very loud tractors and blowers throughout the entire 14 holes I payed today. I stopped on hole 14, as it wasn't worth trying to play, with the loud distractions!. When voicing my concern to the young man at the desk he, said, ""well we have to maintain it sometime"". His manager came out and did not help or say a word. Very poor customer service! Therefore; the 1 rating!"
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"This course features a terrible routing which at times can be confusing where to go for the next hole. In addition, it has a cart with a GPS system which 90% of the time just warns you to avoid construction or to be near the cart path instead of showing you distance."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"The course is well maintained, but has larger issues with poor pace of play, a teenage staff that doesn't care, and a routing that is terrible. If you're going to spend Carmel-type money on a course, there are plenty of better options. If you want a cheaper course that's nice, consider literally any of the munis in Indy, you'll have a better time."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"This course has it all for a great price. The course is in great shape led by a dedicated Greenskeeper - Bob. It has a variety of holes and hazards so it is challenging as evidenced by the amount of golf balls to be found. Creeks run through out. Lots of wild life (deer, hawks) and protected habitats. A new club house and set of pools is being built. Hope they do not raise greens fees. Still affordable for retirees."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Top line: Brookshire is a good municipal course with a lot of interesting holes
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Overall Brookshire is a good course. Apparently it was a private course that since been bought by the City of Carmel. Most of the holes are interesting and require a decent amount of ‘shot making’, but there are a few holes on the front that are fairly straightforward. Conditions were just fine, clubhouse is a little underwhelming."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Bottom line: a fun track that I would recommend to play.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Have played Brookshire numerous times, have always thought it needed manicured. Was glad to see they have taken down some trees to improve hole 7, and distances on the Golfcarts really helps. Fun course to play if your hitting it straight, and worth the trip . Condition was nice , course is always a challenge ."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Professional and friendly staff, challenging layout, excellent pace of play,GolfNow price! Fantastic!!"
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"When lots of courses are drying out, Brookshire is in great condition. Greens were soft yet fast and fairways lush. Would definitely recommend this Course for a good time."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,City owned course - lots of elevation - very pretty.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Had a nice round of golf on Saturday. The weather was perfect and the course was in really great shape. The starter that was at the 1st and 9 th tees could not have been any nicer and helpful. He was apologizing for the slow play, when in fact we finished 18 in less than 3 1/2 hours. So slow play wasn't a factor even though there are numerous places to lose and look for golf balls. Lots of tricky holes so I think my score should improve my next round there."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Not sure I would want to pay full price to play. Keep looking for specials.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"I am not a fan of how this course is designed. A lot of blind shots, a lot very odd tee boxes that allow for only a small view of the fairway, a lot of little things that added up to this course not being an enjoyable experience. If this course was in great shape I would recommend it, but as it stands, this course is not worth the price. Hole 17's green was so ate up that it was tempting to chip a 15 foot putt. Hole 18 was littered with balls from the driving range. These balls must not have been picked up all day, because at 5 o clock, there were 10 range balls on the green and dozens more surrounding it and on the fairway. All in all, if this course was managed better it becomes worth the money, but in no way is it worth what they are charing at the present time, and they are not charging much."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"I was getting off of work and my wife was out of town, so I was looking for a place to play around 6 p.m. and low and behold I found a course close to me.Definitely wanting to play there again. They are in the process of making some improvements to the course that will make it a gem."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Definitely well maintained!
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,I will be back SOON.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,As a resident of Carmel I enjoy playing the course!Had not been there in over a year due to slow playAnd overbooking!Went well and thought the course was in great shape for Aplril!
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"We had a tee time at 1:56, yet right before ours they let a threesome and another group of two on right in front of us. We weren't able to tee off until almost 2:30! The threesome was there to only drink and goof off and really held everyone up! Course was under a lot of renovations- new trees, new grass, redoing cart paths.. will be nice once finished but was inconvenient while playing. I'll definitely give the course another chance, but was really displeased with the pace of play."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Nice to see the course getting some renovation . The banks along the creek are getting a much needed upgrade. The trees along 6 and 8 creek have been removed should make more playable, however I can see long hitters hitting tee shots from 8 onto 7 now that the trees are gone. The next work that needs to done is brush areas at the bottom of 1 and next to the green on 13 would open up the course more. Thank you city of carme for keeping tee box on 15 and putting $ into the renovations."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"This is a player course. Plays long due to lay-ups and doglegs, The greens are smooth and quick, fairways in good shape. The rough is not very long but the fairways are narrow."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"This was my first time playing this course and it was recommended by a friend who hadn't played there in a few years. This course was in very poor shape. Very few select areas had normal grass, and so much of the course appeared to be in much need of major grass reseeding and reconstruction. We played ball in hand since there were too many shots that landed in areas with no grass in both fairways and rough. The course also had the most annoying golf carts controlled by GPS that would shut the cart off and force you to put the cart in reverse in random places on the course due to ""detecting"" that you were close to a green. The feature sounded cool, but was very frustrating in actuality."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Course was in horrible shape. Having played this course in the past I was amazed at the online price we found for the round. Once we got there we saw why. They were obviously having a hard time keeping grass alive. They were actively out spreading seed and trying to recover but it was a mess. We had to basically play improved lies the entire round to find grass to hit from. The layout is fun but with the current conditions I wouldn't have played there for free. I'm sure they'll recover in the off season, this course has always been in decent to great shape in the past."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Course is in horrible condition. Clearly has issues with drainage, with lots of fairway lost to brown outs from rain/sun. Greens very muddy and ugly."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Layout is very targety. You'd need to play it multiple times to know where to go, but I wouldn't recommend playing it once. Even for the hot deal price, it's not worth it."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Bottom line, it's the worst course I've played in Indiana in terms of layout and conditions. Spend time/money elsewhere."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"This was a challenging course with many narrow fairways. There were a few blind tee shots that I would love to play again. Overall the greens were very nice, they rolled true, but a few of them were pretty soggy. A few of the fairways had some pretty saturated areas also . I can overlook that because the guy in the clubhouse said that they had 13 inches of rain in the last 12 days. I would definitely play this course again and recommend anyone to try this course ."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"The course was in pretty good shape. A lot of woods and rough, so potentially some ball loss for less than advanced golfers. Narrow fairways in some cases however a lot of back and forth play waiting on those coming at you to hit shots. What really displeased me was the carts would slow down each time you entered a fairway and cut off if you got too close to the green. I understand why, however this was never explained to us and a distraction. All in all not very fun."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"I play both the north and south courses and use Golf Now. The staff is always so friendly and helpful. Quite often they will let you go a little early to help beat the heat or rain forecast. They are working on the course trying to make a good golf course a little better, which I find refreshing. Thanks staff for making us Golf Now customers feel welcome."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"I do not normally do reviews and I made sure I played the course twice before I bashed it. Pace of play was awful nobody would let me play through, not the courses fault but should have a ranger there were 20 people standing around that worked there when I tee'd off and when I finished. If you like courses with giant creeks in the middle of fairways and blind tee shots this course is for you (not one but 3 holes with a creek that runs through the fairway). Some of the locations of the Blue tees you have to hit around trees or bushes directly in front of you. It's a shame cause it seems they just want to be a hard course cause they are in Carmel, could be a great course with some work in the offseason (tree and bush removal and moving tee boxes). Also the GPS on the cart does not tell you the distance to the pin and they have no pun position chart."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Course certainly has its challenges, but still enjoyable to play. Would recommend to anyone in the area."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Open at times has a few tight holes
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"I had not played this course in about 15 years. It is quite a drive for me. We had a foursome and they allowed us to tee off when we were ready. This course was in GREAT shape. Rough, fairways ( from what the other 3 guys told me) and greens. Lots of big trees. You have to hit the ball well to score well. What a challenge and what a fun course for a money game."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Considering the 4-5 inches of rain that fell 2 days before my round, the course was in very good condition. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they have added GPS to the carts here. This place is well run by the staff. It is not quite in the top tier of courses in the metro area, but close behind. All in all, I'm a fan."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Use the hot deal price a lot of times at this course and it is really a good deal for this nice of a course. The staff is always friendly and even will let you go early if they can. They really try to accommodate you. Was a little slow at first because of mens club but opened up really fast and it wasn't that bad anyway. Course in great shape and greens are perfect. The rough is thick and challenging. Good experience :)
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,I booked this round on-line and got a great rate for the 18 hole round with cart included. The fairways and greens are in very good condition for spring golf.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Brookshire is a decent, above average track in the Indy market. It's well priced with an interesting layout that features some elevation changes in its routing, not all that common in the Indy area."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Course conditions are good, with a few worn spots, but not all that significant. Bunkers look well-maintained, which can also be uncommon for the area. The greens rolled very well, but are quite firm and tend to not hold shots"
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Course in nice shape. Greens medium speed and holding approach shots well.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Fairways in good shape and rough thick with leaves as expected this time of year. A little problem with blind shots and not knowing if group in front had cleared.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Would play again.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Hasn't rained in weeks yet the course was squishy. Most people think green is good but could have been a little firmer and faster. Greens do putt true
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Overall a great course and fun to play. Always like playing there. A starter for mid day was needed as some groups cut their tee time and then slowed the rest of the groups down. Got bottle necked on 15 thru 18 waiting for 4 groups in front of us. Behind myself and a friend was two separate single golfers who we let join us due to lengthy wait for everyone. typically not like this for this course , so hopefully just a fluke with your not so everyday golfers."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"This is a nice course, although this was the first time that I booked through GolfNow. There was no marshall and a fivesome of women backed-up the course. The first nine holes took 3 hours to play and we finally went around six foursomes to finish the eighteen. I realized this was an anomily. Never before had I experienced this at Brookshire. The wait absolutely ruined our round."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,This course will challenge you to use different clubs off the tee with placement for the second shot very important. The course was in good condition. A few holes are difficult to view from tee. Be sure to have gps or course layout from pro shop.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,This is course number three since I've moved to Indiana and by far my favorite. As a player that thrives from the tee box this course was quite the challenge. Many of the medium length par 4's have water right at the driver's landing point at 260- 280 yards or so. This made me play a lot of 3 wood and low irons off the box. There were also many holes that had a very small window to be able to go after the green in two. If you would like to challenge yourself and get out of the driver/ nine iron type holes this is where you need to be. I will be back to continue to polish my game. I was very thankful to get out with a 39/36!
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Early spring and the rough is very thick and fairways in excellent shape. Staff is very friendly and although the front was aerated in the am, we were sent off the back nine and by the turn- the front nine was opened."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Front greens were very playable despite aeration and sanding.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Really nice course, fast greens, nice mix of different style holes"
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Enjoyed this course a lot, its tight fairways and challenging layout made for an enjoyable round. I will be back. Nice range and practice facility, too."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Nice course. Greens in good shape. Few tight holes but plenty of them wide open.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Beautiful weather, nice course, friendly staff and all for a great price! Will surely return and definitely recommend to others."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,leaves were a problem they just blow them off the fairways and of course they blow back lost 5 blls in the second cut of rough. They need to clean them off the course will not play in the fall
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Course was in good shape except for some rough tee boxes. Course was empty and pace of play was up to me.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"First time playing here, it is good course for the value."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,This was my worst experience ever on this course. The first 9 holes the ranger kept riding by us like there was a problem when there was nobody within 2 holes of us either way. The second 9 they let a foursome start out on 10 in front of us and they held four groups up the whole back 9. Never saw that ranger that ranger the entire back.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,The rate for last minute tee time was great! Once I got on others wanted to join in and we had a good time.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,The course was in decent shape and the employees were great as usual (the bunkers need work). I use the driving range often and play occasionally when there is space. Pin placements this last time increased the challenge this last time out but overall always a good day at Brookshire.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Fun little track. Has some challenging greens. Green conditions could be a little better. Rangers are super friendly and not dictatorial. Pace of play was a little slow. Not necessarily the courses fault as I had a single in front of me that would not pair up. Then a two some that were being held up by a foursome. All in all a great course for under $30.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,From the white tees-this is a good challenge for guys that only drive it 220yd. Course was in good shape and pace of play was good for a friday afternoon
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"As with any course you play for the first time, this course has some gotchas that only locals and multi-time players would know about. The course was if good shape, and the greens rolled well, except for all the un-repaired ballmarks. Would definitely play this course again if I ever make it up this way."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"I've played the course in the past and I've always enjoyed it. On this visit, the conditions were absolutely awesome! Best shape I've ever seen it actually. I'll definitely be back and I recommend this course highly."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Decided to play after seeing a Golfniw offer the night before. 18 hole fee was $31 with cart. Fairways and greens in best shape I've ever seen here. Bunkers a little ragged around the edges and could use some work. Broken down cart paths are dusty.... Had to wash my bag afterwards. City of Carmel's only city owned course deserves better. Kudos to the greenskeeper however for the fairway and greens condition on an obviously limited budget.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Steady as always. Good pace of play. Good conditions.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"First time to play the course in over 10 years, because the condition of some greens had been poor.....but not now. Course maintenance greatly improved. The efforts are showing. This course is a gem that was thankfully ""saved"" by the city. I will seek this course out now as it was a pleasure to have played."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,It is always good to get out and play this course every year. There are some tough challenging holes and some fun straight forward ones. The old trees on the course prove some good defense.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Great day at a nice course. Everything was just fine, including their NEW golf carts.One problem, mowing. The mowers get too close for comfort!"
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,The course is in great shape esp the greens! The pace was really good. We started at 10a and finished under 4 hrs. Very immaculate course with new bridges and lots of green! Thank u rain! Very friendly staff! Great practice area! Very worth the money paid !
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Course was in great shape despite rain over the last couple days.Greens had a lot of grass clippings on them which made putting difficult.Im sure that was do to weather conditions so that would not prevent me from returning.I will definetly be back when weather is better.Staff was great.Thanks golf now for great deal
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"I remember playing here as a kid in the 90's, and at that time this course was about the worst I had ever seen. I went back and played here again on a friend's recommendation and his promise that I wouldn't be disappointed. Wow, was he right! I couldn't believe I was playing on the same golf course! The staff is friendly, the facility is clean. And as far as the course itself goes, I've NEVER seen it in this nice of condition. The way it is being maintained could just about make it pass for a PGA course. It's very challenging, long (almost 7000 yards, which I enjoy), TONS of obstacles, a very cool layout in a great neighborhood, and an overall very relaxing, peaceful atmosphere. A perfect place to play golf! And all for a spectacular price!!!"
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Fairways and greens were all in good condition. Play moved at good pace. Very good value for this course.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,This course was good value for the Carmel area. The course was well maintained and the course provided an indepth score card for each hole. The score card had easy to find landmarks to help determine distance.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,The course has so challenging holes. Course management was necessary. It was a joy playing the course.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Although two inches of rain had fallen over the previous 36 hours, the creek did its job. Some spots on graveled sections of cart path were wet, but the greens were fine and only a few areas of fairway were mushy. The leaf-blower drivers had done their job. This is an interesting and well maintained course."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Fairways and greens in great shape. Only issue we had was trouble finding balls with all the leaves. A must play for any golfer in Indy.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"While the course is very tight and not very forgiving most holes, its was a very fun challenging course to play. If you don't place ball in fairway you are guarenteed to lose a shot on that hole. Greens were lightning fast and challenging. course in great shape, staff doing its best to keep leaves off the course as staff was out throughout my round mowing and keeping fairways and greens cleared. Staff very friendly and professional. Thouroughly enjoyed the experience will absolutely go back and play the course again"
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Course is playing in great condition given the late season. Everything was well mowed and staff was very friendly. You cannot beat the price for this course. Bunkers were raked, greens looked nice, and fairways were maintained. I really enjoyed the round."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,The golf course was in great shape. Very happy with the conditions. For the price this course is a must play.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Course has a nice degree of challenge, and was in overall good condition. However, the pace of play was horrid! Our round took 5 1/2 hours to play, and only on the last 3 holes did the group behind us have to wait...so we were not the slow ones! Holes are very close to one another, and we started counting how many times we heard someone yell ""fore""! We reached 15 by the time we got to #18. That is a lot of ""fore""!Given the vast number of courses in the area, I do not envision playing Brooskshire again. Sorry!"
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Greens are in excellent shape, rolling nicely. Course layout does not require a long drive."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"My friend and I rode 18 in May. The driving range could be a bit wider and we should have brought a ball retriever for some of the balls we lost in the creeks, especially on the front 9. There were a few times when our balls got pretty close to the houses and backyards on certain holes. Nice course overall, beautiful mature trees (especially the sycamores on the southeast corner of the course). There are more pristine courses in Carmel, but it's hard to beat the prices at Brookshire, particularly through Golfnow."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Nice pro and OK, somewhat tight design.However, there are a number of holes where you can be hit by balls from other holes- I got hit twice and was not playing in the rough all the time! Neither time the golfers could see me.For the money, you can do better."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Challenging course but good practice; some of the short par 4's and par 3's cause play to back up. Would like the creek distances to be marked more clearly.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Overall, still makes you think, let's you practice driving and chipping, and is a good value for the price."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Course currently in early spring needs some work. Greens medium to slow speed. Rough currently needs cut and rolled for rough spots.
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,Leaves had been cleared off the fairways. Very good condition
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"Course was in good shape. Our cart died and we had to push it up the 18th hole. It was a nice day and there were way too many people out there, so waited for about 5 minutes on every shot."
Brookshire Golf Course,517-brookshire-golf-course,"The course was in average condition and had a different feel from the front 9 to the back nine. I preferred the layout/condition of the front nine more than the back. There are a couple demanding holes on the front and the par 4 after the par 5 by the houses will test your nerves. Overall, a fair value for a Saturday round of golf."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,코스 설계가 도전적이면서 특이해서 너무 즐거운 라운딩을 하였습니다.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,The views on this course are very nice. Especially from tee # 1 & tee # 10. It’s a fun course to play. The back nine seems under construction and is not as in good of condition as the front nine.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,The course has really improved over the last year. They use the hill to challenge a golfer on several holes. Fairways were in good shape. The greens were in great shape and rolled at a nice and true speed. Back to the clubhouse at the turn for refreshments. Staff was very helpful and made the experience pleasant. Worth playing and will return.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Bluff Creek GC is only about 10 minutes from my house, and I am thrilled I gave it a play. It was early in the morning and the dew was thick. Greens were glacially slow, but the ball did leave a nice tracer line in the green's dew for analytical uses. The lengths were good, the par 3s interesting, and all for a great price. I walked it, as my wife insists golf with a cart isn't exercise and it was a lovely walk - exept the hill back up to the clubhouse! Will definatly be back, and hopefully soon! -Rev.AJB"
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Need to get dew off greens, and they are a little long, they are in great shape otherwise.Hard to tell fairway from rough on some holes."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Greens were in excellent shape. Rest of the course needs help…more weeds in rough and fairway than I would like. Don’t want to be too critical because weather has been extremely dry of late. Would like to see the course after receiving normal rainfall before making a final determination.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,This course is getting better every year. The new owners and staff are doing a tremendous job upgrading and maintaining this property. The course has several holes with a lot of character including a couple of doglegs with raised/elevated greens that are true gems to play.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,I play this course whenever I'm in town. Love the different elevations. Excited to see 10 once construction is completed. Great challenging course!!!!
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Just terrible golf, lost multiple balls in the crabgrass rough that you can’t tell a difference from the fairway. Greens were super beat, impossible to putt without hitting a ball divot or someone’s shoe marks. Multiple tee boxes under construction and the ones that weren’t were also beat. Gave up after the front 9 because of the 3 hr 9 hole pace of play and the course quality. Been playing golf for 22 years and never played a course this bad."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"I would agree that other than the 1st, 9th, and 10th holes, this layout is pretty pedestrian. But I do not a agree with a recent reviewer that it was in poor shape. The greens were pretty nice, if a little soggy, maybe to save them from the 90-degree temps. I didn’t find the fairways and rough a problem, although maybe not manicured, for sure.. There are no sand traps, but several water hazards and ditches. A number of hazards are hard to see from the fairway and were a surprise to me as a person playing here for the first time. The electric carts are the fastest I have ever driven: reminded me of my Tesla! I had to ease back on the accelerator, since the crumbling cart paths couldn’t handle a cart going that fast! The pro shop staff were very friendly and welcoming, took me out on the veranda and pointed out where everything was. I had no problems with pace of play at all, but I was playing on a Tuesday. The course would be very walkable. Although there are 2 VERY large hills that would be taxing, the rest of the course is fairly flat without long traverses between green and the next tee. The course is a little far from my west side home, but if I were on the south side I imagine I would be happy to play it. I was using a Group Golfer discount voucher, so it was a great bargain for me."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Great experiences out golfing with friends. Thank you!
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Great course tucked away on the southside of Indy. I play here several times a month. They’ve put in alot of work on this course. Staff is friendly and fantastic.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Played this course once and never again. Hole 1 and 10 are awesome and unique aside from that very straight up and down/basic course. Some of the worst pace of play as well. They allow 5-6 in their groups and do not control pace. We had to skip a hole because it was becoming so backed up if we didn’t it would have been a 5-6 hour round. Staff was friendly, greens were nice, but nothing else good to say about the course. Overall better courses to play for the same cost. Will not be back."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Bluff Creek has put a lot of work into this course in the past couple years and it shows. It’s a great course with challenging holes. The 10th hole is a course favorite! Great scenery and the staff are friendly and helpful!
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"The staff here has always been friendly. I’ve played this course about 30 times in the last two years and for the first time (I’ve played) they had a ranger out checking the pace of play which was needed. This course has been upgraded with a new deck at the club house and 10th whole tee box remodel, within the last few months. Some of the best views you’ll find in a golf course around here."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Amazed at all the work that had been done. Course was setup long and with wet ground there was no roll. Great confession stand
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Loved service! Played alone. Other groups of 4 and 6 somes allowed me to play through! Made my day! Glad I played!
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,This course was Picture Perfect. Truly a delightful and very pleasing to the eye... I had a great time
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Course was nice, but played several nicer courses! Greens were good, layout okay!For the money it was nice!"
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Loved this course. Even with all the construction still nice and fun to play
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Not a bad course at all, Usual ponds were dried up and was able to hit out of what would normally be water hazards. First nine only a single in front, back nine a for few foursomes were started right in front of me and behind me. So I was a single in between foursomes after playing a wide open front. Didn’t appreciate that. Great view on 10th and 1st tee."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,First time playing. Fun course with elevation changes on 4 holes. Friendly and helpful staff. Will be back again
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,my first time playing the course love it fairways was in good shape greens was in good shape love the elevated greens on a couple of holes
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,This course has the 2 worst holes in central Indiana. #8 is a par 5 with the green being 30ft above the fairway. There is a tree dead in the way of the approach shot to. You have no idea how far to hit the 3rd shot because long is dead as is short and the green is not 20yds wide. It’s a gimmick hole! Then #10 is a 100 yard par 3 that is 100ft downhill. Once again…no idea how far to hit the ball with short and long being dead. Another gimmick hole.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,On the plus side…the greens are in excellent condition.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Alot of improvements being made. Course was dry except for the greens which were soft. Fun layout.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Played here yesterday for the first time. Been making an effort to try more of the courses around Greenwood, so I came here. Not a bad little course, especially with the HotDeal I got for $18!"
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Not too tough, not a lot of water or sand, but still need to hit some accurate shots to avoid tree lines. Some interesting holes with elevated tee boxes and greens make for some good views and fun shots. It’s the kinda course that’s not too pretentious but you’ll still have a good day, go check them out!"
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,The view from the clubhouse is amazing. Hole #10 is being reconstructed and will be an even better focal point in the future! I really enjoyed playing the course!
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Slowest round of golf you will play. This is a course for starters, at least that is who is playing here. Ranger will tell you he will make people keep pace but it was not the case. 2 groups in front of us hitting multiple drives(shanks). At the turn, another 4some hopped in front of us while we were getting drinks. They were another 4some playing slow hitting multiple drives. Again ranger said he would say something but didn’t. On top of the slow round, I don’t think they allow divot tools on the course, the greens weren’t in great condition. TLDR if you like to play golf, spend the extra $10 and play somewhere else unless you’re fine with playing very slow."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Love the course. Well maintained. Very interesting course. Awesome value for the price. Only complain was there 20 minutes before tee time and lined up and still waited till 20 minutes after my tee time to tee off not allowing the course to be finished before dark. Based upon quality of golfer on the course and difficulty of course would space tee times 12 minutes apart or have a course ranger to keep pace of play going.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"I golfed Bluff Creek with my son and it was a solid course at a reasonable price. The staff was friendly, the course was well maintained, and we both found the course to be of moderate difficulty. Would recommend for others."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"I was greatly impressed with the improvements being made on this course. The greens were immaculate. The fairways and tee boxes were also in great shape. I don’t know if the course has a new owner, but it’s evident improvements are being made. The course has a beautiful layout. I will definitely be back!"
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Don’t let negative reviews stop you from playing here.Here’s my reviewTees okFairways for most part,very goodGreens little firmGreens smooth consistent and very fair speedRough not real high , very playableBunkers hit and missGreat price💲Inside staff as nice as it getsCourse conditions have done a 180 since 2 years ago"
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"I think this was my 2nd time playing this course, with about a year in between, so I'm definitely not a regular. My only complaint was the lack of signs. There was a sign from the clubhouse pointing the direction of the driving range - but then no more signs, and about 3 paths to choose from. And the #10 tee box - no signs whatsoever, but it does look like there is some renovation going on, so maybe that was temporary, but still, better signage would definitely help. Other than that, we had a great time!"
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"First time on this course. View of course was amazing! Some rought fairways. Overall, nice course. 👌"
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Yes it's winter. Most courses will be in similar condition. Greens are really chopped up around the edges. No tee box markers in place, but the dozens of broken tees will give indication of where to play from. No sand bunkers. No fairways. Just dormant weeds from on end to the other."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Great time playing golf with my youngest and his friend.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Improvements are being made all over the course! Worth the money to play for sure!
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"One of the worst courses that I have ever played. 6 hour pace of play. A bunch of people who should be on the range and not on the course. Course overbooks tee times, 5 group back up on the first tee"
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Blue tees were set as far back as possible, creating some nice challenges with managing distance and avoiding water hazards. The elevation changes were extreme on three holes offering additional hurdles. Fairways and roughs were wide, but stray further and you're ball is lost in impenetrable woods and undergrowth. No bunkers."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Tee boxes and greens were in fair condition at best, with damage to greens starting to get a little out of control in some spots. Practice green was a disaster and virtually unusable (over half was dead grass or none at all). Range was wide, but predominantly crabgrass, so practice with tight lies wasn't an option."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Staff was efficient and very friendly. I played in the morning and the scenery, with a lot of areas left natural, was nice. I spoke briefly with the manager and he mentioned some plans to get the course in better shape, as well. That said, I hope to return."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"All in all, it was an inexpensive outing that- despite the flaws - was enjoyable and challenging. I wouldn't hesitate to play there again."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,They have put a lot of effort into the tee boxes and the whole course this season! Love playing here
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,We had a twosome and had a single join us after first Hole. Pace was ok through first 4 holes. Then Came to a screeching Halt for about 10 minutes. Twosome ahead of us said there was 5 some ahead of the two foursome ahead of them. Pace was slow but ok through 9. Went to the 10th tee box and there was 3 groups ahead of us waiting to play. So we left after 9 so an inexpensive rate for 18 became an Expensive rate for 9.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,If your looking for a course that checks a lot of boxes this is it. Scenic ✔️ cool layout ✔️ good conditions ✔️ value for your dollar✔️ friendly staff✔️
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,I said I wouldn’t play this course again until the construction on 37 was complete and yet here I am. I was scheduled to arrive 15 minutes early but with traffic and due to the bluff creek being a bit hidden I passed it completely. I was precisely on time and had a great outing. Probably my best ever! Staff was great the older man and two young girls were very courteous. Can’t wait to come back.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"I really enjoy this course. Staff is wonderful, price is right and the bluff views are magnificent!"
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Love the course layout. Course is a little rough as well as the tee boxes. Missing waters in places where there used to be. Great price for what you’re getting though.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"We were told the course condition had improved. Not so. Tee boxes were terrible, fairway okay, greens way too slow."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Dirt fairways. Not cut well. Really hard. Greens were okay condition.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Cons:Slow greensRock-hard fairways with a lot of crabgrassNo bunkersPoor conditions of Tee BoxesCrumbling cart pathsCustomers playing music and drinking while playingUnreliable Carts
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Pros:Some challenging elevationsPlenty of water hazards to work aroundGreat pricesVery friendly staff
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"- Bunch of cool hole layouts including a massive drop-off par 3- Tee boxes were in extremely poor condition- A couple of carts died mid-round- Would play again for the price, and also to play a couple of their best holes as well"
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"If you are looking for an average to beginner course, this is for you. It has all of the things you need to know about the game. From many water hazards to OB lines that are easy to learn. And the staff are SUPER nice."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Poor staff, poorly maintained course. One of the worst ladies I've ever dealt with running the place. Course has definitely seen better days. Cart path is so bad it's better to just drive on the grass. Only good thing I can say is that the patrons were very friendly people. Oh yeah, and the sprinklers came on halfway through our round. No warning by the staff. Never going back to this place."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"I used the GolfNow app and played 18 holes for $19. What a deal! The changes in elevation add a challenge for more experienced golfers, yet openness allows players of various skill levels to still enjoy the course."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Beatiful day. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Greens in good shape. Thanks@
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Not nicest course around my any means but for the price I don’t think you can complain. It’s not a bad course and has some real fun holes. Maintenance could improve and does have some spots of flooding after rain but I say for the price it’s great.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"For those with a good deal of experience, who prefer lush, well-kept courses, I would NOT recommend this course. It has a lot of negative elements:"
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"No dress code (negative if you prefer a more formal aesthetic)VERY poor course conditions - this includes mowing, small shallow and often muddy ponds, and crumbling cart pathsNo sand bunkersExtremely small practice greenCarts that have ""seen better days"""
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Despite these significant flaws, there were some positive attributes:"
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"No dress code (positive if you prefer a more casual atmosphere)Very InexpensiveElevation changes made for some interesting and challenging holesGeneral layout is fairly good.Staff was very friendlyI like courses with trees and wildlife, and this course had it in abundance"
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Conclusion: If you're a more experienced golfer, I would heartily suggest looking elsewhere. If you're a casual golfer or new to golf and looking for an inexpensive option to just get in some holes and improve your game (and maybe enjoy some nature), this could be a solid choice."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Needs some tlc. I liked the layout. Lots of hills so beware. My experience was if you hit it off the tee to the fairway it was almost as bad as the rough. Overall it was ok .
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,More mud than there was grass throughout the course. The “tee box” was little more than posts in the ground in the middle of the fairway. Several interesting holes with lots of elevation change but those few holes do not make up for the overall course conditions. Wouldn’t waste my time here again.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Course had a lot of elevation changes and elevated greens/tee boxes. Made for a fun round even with the slow pace of play of the group in front of us
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Decent course love the layout more than anything. Greens were in good shape otherwise don’t expect a country club conditions. Nice round of golf for the value
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,This course would appear the fairways and greens are mowed maybe once a week. Couldn't tell the fairway from the rough
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Inconsiderate players who will not let faster groups play through.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Yardage on card and tee boxes were about 20 to 30 yards shorts. GPS and range finder verifiedPoor signage at the turn direct to the back nine
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Staff unconcerned of anything.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Only.played 7 of the 18.holes
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Worst waste of.money ever
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Horrible course conditions. Tee boxes were a joke, absolutely no water anywhere period, Fairways were full of rocks, and greens were choppy. Even for $20 not worth the money."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Bluff Creek is a nice layout and a fun course to play. Now the fairways are burned up and are very hard. The greens were in good condition. They need to irrigate and/or get a lot of rain to bring this once nice course back. The cart paths are terrible and the clubhouse is pretty much a victim of COVID-19. Hope to see it return to a nice place to play.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Nice layout with interesting hills and tee options. Staff was super helpful and nice.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,We enjoyed this course some areas were dry but that’s okay.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"I could not get my tees in the ground. There were no fairway.... the whole area was round or really rough. You can tell they allow folks to just play all they can. The cart paths were non-existent and in the few areas there actually was a cart path it was extremely bumpy. No lie, the worst golf course condition-wise I have EBER seen."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,I feel some slight anger when i come to check in and they see i went through golf now. They said they weren’t busy but they made us pair up because we were golf now and they said they are losing out. If anyone knows these are by far the worst carts ever lol. I like the course for the price if i had to pay full price i would pay the same amount somewhere else the reason you are getting people is the good price on golf now so don’t push away customers.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Only payed 13 dollars to play here, although you pay for what you get. The fairways aren’t really any different cut than the rough and doesn’t reward you for hitting them. Overall great course for the cost but not great in general"
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Everything was great other then the tee boxes were very uneven and tore up.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,The course is in pretty good shape for being the middle of August. Tee boxes could use a little work but overall it was good. The only issue is the issue I go there knowing on the weekends the pace of play is very slow. About 4.5 hours to play 18 with a two some.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Very poor taking care of course. Too much for the round . We went through 2 carts as a group and then the group in front of us their cart died on the first hole.No fairways just short rough . Tee boxes were also crap grass or rough . Won’t play there again
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Gorgeous layout, view. Challenging for your average player, yet so fun. The view for tee box 1 and 10 is worth it alone. Wish I wasn’t visiting the area and this course was closer to home."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,If you like playing a slow paced goat ranch then this is the place for you. There are some great views from the higher elevations. The greens are like putting on a fairway because they are so slow. The staff is friendly
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Nice local course, but lakes and traps were quite dry and need to be filled in. Cart path is a joke, and carts are old and outdated. Since I was alone, I played through a couple of groups; otherwise it would have taken forever to play."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,A hacker's paradise for people like me. Great staff. Great value.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Fairways and tee boxes needed to be cut. Greens in good shape. Overall very good value, will recommend to others."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Course was fun, good pace and stunning landscape. The grass was too high and the soil very hard. Difficult to differentiate between fairways vs rough. Greens were greatly maintained. 4 out of 5 overall."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Difficult to enjoy 18 holes with a cart that barely goes and when there are no bathrooms at all. Will not be returning because of those conditions.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,It is a pretty sad place to play golf no grass in fairways roof has it been cut just all round terrible conditions on this Course It would be a course To play For people I mean golfers that don’t know the difference in courses
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,There were no fairways at all on most of the holes. The staff was rather rude. Only nice thing is the elevation changes which can get annoying after you've already played several holes that are similar.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"I love this course. I play fluff because the fairways, but I love this course. Its fun. The staff is great and friendly. An earlier review stated Best Golf Deal in Indy. They could be right. Nothing fancy but I am not Tiger Woods either."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,This is a great course for regular golfers. Greens are excellent. Tee boxes are fine. Great staff. Great course. I play fluff.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,An hour before RT time I received an email from golf now indicating that the golf course ran out of carts. No carts equals no golf. Kind of ridiculous to make those kind of plans if you can't play.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Went during covid season. Nothing on the turn but I expected limited services. Carts are older but get the job done. Elevated tee boxes reminded me of a few corses in Georgia. Overall worth the fee.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Recommendations to staff: better cart path signs, some ball cleaners placed near tee boxes after water hazards or other muddy hazards, charge more after 10. We started at 7:30 and had the course to ourselves but when finishing up the place was packed. Definitely glad we got out early."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"The staff were kind, the course was ok, the greens are decemt. For the price it's worth it. I've enjoyed quite a few rounds here."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"It was my first time visiting this course and I was very pleased with my experience. Wasn’t expensive by any means, employees were friendly and even the other golfers there were very kind as well I don’t know if it was just my lucky day or what but I plan on revisiting the course in the very near future."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Bluff Creek offers fun that you don’t usually get in central Indiana with multiple elevated tee boxes and greens. Although course conditions and amenities may be below average the price is very reasonable based on the course conditions. Holes that aren’t elevated often have water near or around the green adding some difficulty to your approach. A scratch golfer may not enjoy the course due to slow greens or leaves on the greens in the fall, but for your average person just looking for a day out, Bluff Creek is a great option! I know I’ll be back!"
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Nice coarse @ decent price . Carts could be better but overall fun time .
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,I saw a deer while playing. On the 12th hole I think it was.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,You pay what you get. Cheap course. The kart did not function properly. Do not trust other reviews. There was no difference between fairway and rough. Please take care of your course.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Standing at the clubhouse, you look down several hundred feet to the course. Several holes are elevated tees to greens situated way below, and vice-versa. It's a very wide-open course and very forgiving. Greens were pretty slow but rolled true. For $11 it was well worth the drive. If you are a decent player be prepared to wait between shots as there are a lot of newbies playing here."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Scott is the man! Nicest man alive and everybody else is super nice and laid back.You can’t beat unlimited golf with a cart for $20 after 2pm.If it is busy, it is super easy to hop around."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,No control on sending people out. Took 5:29 to play. No marshals so take your chances out there
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Great great place to get away from it all...very friendly place that made me feel at home
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"For the price, bluff creek is a solid golf course. The tee boxes and fairways aren’t the best, but the greens are actually pretty nice. Has some unique holes throughout. Overall I enjoyed it. I will be back."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Nice 18 hole course. It is always drive to your ball. Pace of play is fast. Greens rolled true and were in great shape. The staff is always friendly. Nice views of Downtown Indy.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,This place is a joke. The golf carts are the dirtiest nastiest carts ever. Brakes don’t even work. Ran cart into a tree.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"course was decent people were friendly, but they let out 2 6somes and it slowed play way down"
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,The greens were in good shape But the fairways needed some work
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,The course is very isolated. No worries of hitting into homeowners' yards. The ponds were dried up but its fairly common at this price point. The greens were in good shape and the fairways were wide on most holes. The gentleman at the clubhouse was extremely nice. He deserved 10 stars alone.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,The view of the courses from the Clubhouse was breath taking. First thing I did was took pictures. It felt like I was in the the Smoky Mountains. The staff was awesome. My best friend and myself had a great time for the price. We played a lot of courses in Central Indiana and this course is definitely on our top five. I will be playing this course a couple times a month. The course is very challenging.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"I have played this course regularly for many years now. Nice course in best condition I have seen it in years. There are some spots marked off where they are growing new grass which is fine. Tee boxes are pretty bad however, many times I teed from very back of box or over to side. They had people working on some parts so hopefully they will be much better next season. Not a super difficult course but it is a good one to play with a group of varying degrees of skill. You can still take some risks and be rewarded with this course. 1&10 are a lot of fun with huge elevation changes. Good course overall, I hesitate to pay $30 on the weekends but week rates are good and twilight is even better."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Great value, generally not crowded & course decent shape"
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,The course was in great shape for this time of year in indiana. Recent rains made the greens a tad slow but easy to adjust too.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,No grass in fare ways hard to hit ball off of grass Carts ready for junk yard . Had players hitting into us neaver play that place again (BAD)
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Very Nice place to play , they have a lot of specials and the People a great .. The Course is in very good shape . You will find it has some very scenic Holes and most challenge you to hit the fairways .. Try it you will like it...."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon, so course was crowded so pace wasn't good, but not too bad far as crowded as it was. Staff was nice as they gave us free drinks as our electric cart ran out of juice"
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Lots of water damage on back 9 mud for tee boxes, 11 fairway nothing but crabgrass. Probably due to flooding earlier in the year. Greens in good condition for most part."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,I play here a couple times a year.I was surprised the course was in decent shape after all the rain we've had this year.Tip: Seniors can play on Thursdays for $15 bucks!Problem: GolfNow charges to much for processing!
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"This course has flooding problems, but that doesn't excuse the conditions of the tee boxes and greens. What fairways were there were rock hard and it was better to hit it in the rough/crabgrass to the side."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"back nine was closed because of flooding the week before, so you had to play front nine twice. Five of the 9 on the front were still so wet that it made it horrible to play."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,this course is layed out great.. love the elevations changes
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"We found the course layout very enjoyable. The fairways and greens were average at best but didn't detract from the enjoyable layout. Course was very dry. Great off the tee but very difficult to stick a green. Did not see evidence of irrigation system for fairways. As summer moves on, fairways could become burnt out. Will definitely play again just for the layout."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,This course has a little bit of everything. Elevated tee boxes. Elevated greens and just enough water to keep it interesting. I love playing here.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"It took us five hours to play this course. While you get what you pay for and I do not expect miracles, it is absolutely no fun to play at this pace. Not once did we get waived through despite that we were a too some. Not a ranger to be seen to get golfers to play at a reasonable pace. I will never go to this course again."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"first time playing here. Layout is a little confusing at first. Paid $15 a head for a foursome on Easter Sunday afternoon. Not the flashiest of facilities (cart paths are rough) but the course played well and I liked the landscape and rural setting. Would play again especially for <$20 a head on a weekend. If you like slow greens, play here."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"We booked an 8:00 am tee time on golf now .We needed to start early to finish in time to go to ourson's football banquet at Uindy. We arrived at 7:45am and there was no one in sight. The handwritten sign on the door said course opened at 8:30. So why do you have tee times on line for 8:00 am? So after waiting for 45 minutes, some guy showed up AT 8:30! and didnt even acknowledge us, and went in.So course opens at 8:30 and he guy shows up at 8:30? With no apologies. So after waiting 45 minutes we had to wait even longer for this guy to open and get ready. Very disappointing. We had to rush through to get done in time."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"I played this course a few years ago when Indiana didn't hardly get any rain. So a lot of golf courses where struggling for good conditions, and this was one of them. So me and a friend decided to give it a go on 8/24/14 and it was the worst idea. The gentlemen at check in was dress like Larry the cable guy with cut off sleeves. He was telling us there was no way that golf now had the price at $30 a player until I showed him my confirmation email. Dint wash his hand before handling my food. You can't tell the fairway from the rough. My grass will make for a better tee box then what they had. The greens where very very very slow. Definitely will make a good golfer go crazy and throw your game off. Don't bother dressing like a golfer here because you definitely will look out of place with all the tee shirts you will see out there. They shouldn't charge more than $20 here. Don't like to leave a review like this but if you are charging over $30 I think the golf course should be in ok condition."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Course was in good shape and play was a nice pace. Greens were in good shape.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,This course is in good condition. The staff is very friendly and the price is very competitive for central Indiana courses!
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Played this course today for $35. Not even close to worth it. Fair greens, bad tee boxes, fairways are iffy, no rough (just weeds) fairways play back to back. We had to wait ten minutes in an empty clubhouse just to pay green fees. Played the front 9 in an hour and a half. Played the back in over two and a half because of congestion on the course. If you want to just hack around and can get out for $20 or less then try it, if not then go get a bucket of balls."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,It was a great place to play 18 holes of golf. Some of the carts are falling apart but course conditions are very good. Nice fairways and greens.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,This is one of my favorite courses to play. The course is looking great this year.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Well protected greens and wide open fairways. Huge elevation change one a few holes. A fun course that is well worth the money.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,I have played here many times and it's always a challenge. Not as easy as one might think.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,fairways are non-existent. rough play. hard to follow.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Great course when you can find a deal on golf now..
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Maintenance issues were evident. The course was very wet from heavy rains during the week. Cart paths were poor.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,I am a fan of this course. It has some great elevation changes and some really hard holes. Huge fan of the blind par 3 #10 that drops about 150ft from the tee box to the green. I have never been able to do great on this course even though I've played it several times. I want to have one good game here but I suppose that is why I keep coming back.
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,"Not a long course, but enough trees, water, elevations, and doglegs to make it a challenge. There are a few scenic holes, including two greens that are elevated and cut into and surrounded by a wooded area."
Bluff Creek Golf Course,25454-bluff-creek-golf-course,Course was fun and the setting was very nice. A variety of elevations makes the course interesting. I will be back to play and it was a great bargain. Well maintained throughout.
Zionsville Golf Course,5992-zionsville-golf-course,Lady that works the shop is rude and a liar. Watch her when ur ticket is rang out
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Course conditions are absolutely horrible. Staff workers are not very welcoming at all.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"The course is in horrible shape besides maybe 4 holes (3 which are next to the road and then the 18th hole). Grass isn't cut, fairways are not fairways, tee boxes are horrible, and the greens are an embarrassment."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Long time member and local here. What we have here is a situation involving greed and incompetent owners. This is why local state laws are in place to protect such green space areas. Greedy investors view this property as a housing development. The current owner has no other vision than selling for an unattainable profit from a housing developer. in the meantime, market/advertise the course as playable and back to glory days. ALL LIES... irrigation NEVER WAS FIXED. no water and the course conditions show it. No chemicals, fertilizer, sand or any essentials needed for a basic course. incompetent and non existent staff that don't even know how to mow, that's how lazy the owner is and their ability to hire is worthless. Unless the locals or members demand better and take control will, then this place will truly succeed. DON'T PLAY HERE, Contact your local town council and urge the town of Avon to step up!"
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Positives: The back 9 has some fun and interesting holes. There are some really nice houses back there too. The front 9 is just okay. Pace of play was great.Negatives: Are the course conditions terrible? Yes. Be prepared for that. The greens were rolling about 5 on the stimp. There's not much living grass on the course outside of the greens. The bunkers are transitioning to weeds and dirt.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Every year I tell myself I will give it one more shot. Every year I’m reminded why I don’t. 6 stacks of 2somes waiting on the 4th hole. Greens and tee boxes never mowed. Course condition is terrible. 6.50 for a hot dog at the turn that was ice cold. 10 dollars for 20 range balls. I’ll pay you not to go here
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"It's a great course if you decide last minute you want to play a round, because the tee times will be pretty open. However, the greens are in really rough shape. Several 1 putts turned into 2 putts because of ground that should be getting repaired. None of the bunkers are actual bunkers because all of them have weeds galore growing through them. A couple of the greens were really soggy, and the rest were dry as a bone. Most of the tee boxes are borderline unusable because of the weeds and hard ground. Fairways look pretty good though and I think the layout of the course is both great and challenging. But the greens are really hard to play. For 40$ it's okay. Would be great at 30$ or less."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Start off by saying, the staff is very friendly. The layout is good with a decent amount of variety. The cart screens are really nice. There has been a small amount of improvement over the last couple years but not enough for the price."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"The greens are more like shag carpet, you have to putt the ball so hard that breaks in the green rarely, if ever, come into play. The latest mow left clippings all over the greens making them even worse to putt on."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,The Fairways are ok but the rough is inundated with clover And not cut often enough making it almost impossible to find your ball.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Not sure what is happening with the sand traps except nothing. Overgrown with weeds and hard as asphalt.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,90% of the Tee boxes are in horrible shape. Can't find a flat place to stand with all the divets and most are hard as a rock.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Have seen several groups of 5, 6 and even 8 people playing together making pace of play bad. The cart warns people to pick up pace of play if going too slow but there is no one on the course to enforce it."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"The cart gps blocks carts from getting close to the green which is fine if set correctly but the boundary on most is too large or makes no sense causing you to constantly have to reverse out of a ""restricted"" area. Very frustrating."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"I did not play this course in its hay day, wish I had. It has a ton of potential but more effort and resources are desperately needed to get it there."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"As a past member of this course, it’s unfortunate that the funding of this course has been favored toward the restaurant/clubhouse. This course has a great layout but course conditions are very poor. Greens are not cut short enough for proper play and most are generally in poor condition. With a growing community it would be awesome to have this course back to its old self. Make Prestwick Great Again!"
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Tee boxes were extremely uneven and not tended to with dead spots and weeds/clover. It was difficult to find a good spot to tee up at each hole location from the white tees. There was a lot of clover in and around the fairways and it was difficult to tell where the fairway ended where the first cut began. Lastly, the bunkers have been completely neglected and were unplayable. The bunkers were hard, clumpy dirt that are overgrown with weeds. In the few bunkers that did have sand, the sand was hard and compact and unplayable. I enjoyed the course layout, but Prestwick leaves a lot to be desired as you can tell that course itself used to be really nice, or at least has the bones of a nice course. There are far better courses available for $45/person in the area."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Brought my son and girlfriend to play . The staff was awesome. The course was not . The lay out is great . The red tee markers were not found. . Sand trap more like weed traps . Fairway are the worst
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,The Course was not well kept at all. Spent $40.00 to have dandelions growing in the fairways. The greens looked as if they hadn't been cut in weeks. Wow.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"ive been to prestwick back when it first open with no public access. i went last year a few times and mentioned that the course could use some tlc especially the bunkers! bunkers were so overgrown that there werent really bunkers. so much weeds and dandelions everywhere you would lose your ball easily, knowing you just hit a fairly decent shot right off the fairway. looked for about 10 minutes for my ball a couple times in areas it should have been. but with all the white flower weeds overgrown it wasnt possible. greens were in decent shape. but for $55/rnd id say its a little over priced. there are other options nearby for that price or lower that are in better condition. ill play here again but it is a last resort for me. sorry prestwick."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Tee boxes (blue) were garbage at best. The bunkers were a joke. I paid a cheaper than normal rate on GN and that was even way too much. I’ve played muni’s for cheaper that were in a thousand times better shape.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Used to be a favorite before they went private a few years back...has a long way to go since becoming a public facility again...cart paths were outstanding, cart amenities very good......course itself very bad...seems like nothing has been done in past 3+ years to improve actual course...restaurant is very good!"
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"I played a round of golf here recently for $8.92 but somehow feel like the victim of a heist. Tee boxes are a combination of weeds and desert, fairways are unrecognizable, bunkers are forests and the greens are actual berber carpet. I’ve known some golf courses to have slow greens and it would be unfair to put The Prestwick in that category. These greens are slothful. In 18 holes, I didn’t putt a single ball beyond the hole. I don’t know which is more astonishing - that this place is still open or that the golf gods allow it to carry the suffix “country club.” I’ve played many-a-rounds of golf (9-hole courses, par 3 courses, walking-only and cash-only courses) and I’ve never found myself on a tee box genuinely unsure if the hole was to the north, south, east, or west. If you too have never had that experience, you will multiple times in a round here.There is one thing beautiful about this course - the screens on the golf carts. I’ve never seen so much detail in golf cart tech. Distances from tee box, to green, and to pin are provided effortlessly. Touchscreen capable and zero glitches. However, it may be just too much tech for this course layout. A teenager in the group in front of me found out all too well after her cart locked her out from going forward and only made reverse mode available. She was two feet from backing into the pond before myself and a couple others eventually pushed her forward.For a course in this condition, it’d be great if the friendly staff gave you a little heads up before your round of what you’re about to experience. It would’ve gone a long way for the nice young man in the pro-shop to hit me with a “our lawnmower broke three summers ago” or for the man with a cigarette emptying trash on the first tee to subtly ask if I “got anything good to listen to out there?” Just a little nod to let me know I wouldn’t actually be playing real golf today would’ve been a nice touch."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Course layout is great, staff was very friendly and helpful! The course was in poor condition. Fairways were long, lost multiple balls within a couple feet of fairway rough was so long. Greens were cut long and extremely slow. Every sand trap had been abandoned and was full of grass on top of sand which was as hard as concrete. A little work and the course could be great!The carts are new with GPS but continued to get locked out. We had to back up and reset the GPS at least 10 times on the cart path."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,None of the sand traps were taken care of. By the looks of it with all the weeds growing in them they were that way all year.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Always a good course to play. You can see the work they are doing to restore this course to what it once was.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"The goodThe course layout is challenging and fun. Every hole is different and it’s not a grip it and rip it course which I like. Actually have to put some thought into every hole and course management is a must.Love the scenery.The badEven though it’s later in the year and the course being a little dry which is to be somewhat expected, the greens should be well maintained. These weren’t too bad but still affected the toll of the ball enough to make a difference but not too crazy.The tee beds for the most part were hard and for the most part ok with the exception of a few.The club house was nice except not much in golf related items. We always get a course logo ball and ball market and they didn’t have any.The food was way overpriced as was the beverage’s.Overall it’s a course that’s worth playing and management was nice.At golf now rate of $28 after using tee time code it was still a great experience. After all we’re still playing golf and that’s always a win win."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"There is no place to write a review on their Facebook page, so I'll write a review on my personal page."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"We will never come back to this place again. We read a post that was placed in the Avon Chatter Group on Facebook about this restaurant. I called ahead asking about reserving seating to dine outside. I was told no reserved seating was allowed. I wanted to take my husband out for his birthday, and we were excited to try the food at the Prestwick. We looked at the menu prior, and had in mind what he wanted to try. We arrive at 705pm on 8/18/23 to a half empty bar/restaurant with a band playing. We walked around to a window near the door to the outdoor seating. There was a lady with short dirty blond hair at the cash register."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"She never looked up, but said, ""sit anywhere inside.""Me: ""may we sit outside?""Her: ""If there is a spot, yes.""My husband and I proceed to go outside. There were several spots outside. The people that were outside, wasn't eating, but going in and out of the bar to grab drinks. We were talking to them."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Ten minutes later, no came out to greet us or give us menus. I went back to the window, and asked the same lady for menus. She was very dismissive and said, ""we'll bring them out to you."""
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Another 10-15 minutes went by, and no one came out there. My husband and I got up and went back inside. We looked inside the restaurant, and there were even less people than before. There was an older lady with dark hair with her hair up watching us as we walked passed the bar/restaurant towards the door. No one tried to stop us. No said anything or apologized for having us wait with no service for over twenty minutes. We left."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"If the outdoor sitting was closed or you didn't want to serve us, you should have just said so. We were definitely not welcomed there, and we will never be back. The environment with the stick-in-the-muds."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,We have been to better country clubs. That was more welcoming and more beautiful.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Thankfully, we were able to still salvage what was left of the evening from that huge disappointment. We drove down to the Whiskey Bent Bar. The vibe was just right. The environment was so welcoming. The outdoor seating was nice. The food and drinks were tasty. We had an amazing server name Brandy who took care of us. We thanked her for how professional she was, and how she turned our night around. To see how happy my husband was, made my night. We will definitely be going there often!"
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Was willing to try even after the reviews to see for myself. It is the closest course to me, so it was worth a shot. The sand bunkers have weeds and grass, not just a little. The greens are un-puttable, they have weeds, divots, and scalping. Half of the fairways are cart path only, which is understandable since the course needs so much renovation. Unfortunately it just needs to shut down for a season to get it where it needs to be with no traffic. I was not notified that the golf carts would only be available for use for half of the holes. With the carts having GPS if you entered a ""cart only"" fairway it would shut the cart down...you have to put it in reverse and get back to the path. This is fine with me, if I would have been notified of this before golfing. It was very frustrating on a Par 5 where I hit right of the fairway and the path was on the left. tracking across trying to find my ball and not knowing which club I would need for my next shot... I won't be going back anytime soon."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Lost balls inbounds due to high weeds/grassTee boxes were in bad conditionGreens were fuzzy and or dead in most spotsEmbarrassed to say this course is so close to my home and it’s in this condition for the price ..
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Yea the course could use some upkeep but it’s not nearly as bad as some of the reviews on here. Its definitely worth the cost of play!The staff is extremely friendly! The environment is great as well
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Course is in horrible condition. The golf carts are new and were programmed to prohibit you from leaving the cart path. Completely laughable. Are they afraid you are going to kill the dandelion and clover patches? And of course they didn’t tell you they were cart path only before you paid.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,This course has a great layout. The greens might be the worst I’ve ever played on. They do not bite at all and roll extremely slow.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"I live close so play here often, fairways and greens are getting ""better"" but still need work. Tee boxes are another story, bluntly they suck. Uneven, patchy and difficult to get a good stance on.Staff is always super friendly and love the new range setup. Price is affordable and always easy to get on"
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"There have been some good improvements made to the course over the last year, but unfortunately the greens may not be getting rolled. The ball looks more like a basketball bouncing along rather than rolling.☹️☹️"
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Grass was the worst condition I’ve seen on ANY course in Michigan or Indiana. Absolutely ridiculous they even charge 40. Every green the grass was dead and patchy making putting effectively obsolete. No joke I’m smacking what would be a 50 foot putt, from 10 feet…. And it was short. Extremely wet but no rain the night before….which means they have zero maintenance staff. Horrible conditions, will never play again."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Greens are like fairways, fairways have patches of rough, and the tee box…. Well good luck find it and when you do good luck finding a flat spot. Look it has the potential to be a good spot but they need to hire a good greens crew. The course was fun to play and I played it well but, please tighten up those greens. A aeration would help the pack then down and mow them. The greens were god awful, slow, lumpy, and too long. Cut the grass on the Teebox and get some weed killer for the fairways."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,The greens had a lot of dead spots on them that made putting difficult
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Fairways were ok.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Probably won’t play again unless get another Golfnow deal.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"The course was severely overload with a variety of 4somes, and solos that wouldn’t pair with the duo in front of or behind them, etc. Brutal long day, 6+ hours. Normally that much time on golf course isn’t awful, but these course conditions were about as brutal as the pace of play. Greens were tore up, even for fall. Just overall a very poor experience, not worth the money or the time."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,We enjoyed our round. Always love playing this course. It was so much fun
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Course had a stinch to it, like druncken urine. Pace of round was horrendous because couple of guys in front would not let me thru. A treesome did on hole 8. I caught up to the twosome and waited on them the rest of my round. Course was not busy at all. Fairways do not look anything like the picture. So run down. Awesome layout !"
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"I have played golf at run down muni’s to some of the most exclusive clubs in the country. Usually I feel like you get what you pay for. However, to charge $49 to play Prestwick is a joke. They should have paid us. Most fairways don’t have much grass. The greens were poorly cut, patchy, and different speeds. For a course that used to hold the state finals it is incredibly run down. The investment in GPS carts is fine, but that money would be better served on the courses condition."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"For the shape of this course, it’s worth about half the nearly $50 fee for 18. Decent layout but course conditions are atrocious. I hear they are fixing irrigation issues. I wouldn’t pay more than $20-$25 to play again considering the absolutely terrible shape the course is in."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"I hate leaving a bad review… But yikes. The staff was friendly and they had new GPS on their carts… That’s it though. Tee boxes, fairways, rough and greens were all in unplayable shape. Sad, but they should not be open and charging a fee to play golf."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Course needs a lot of work the layout is nice but the tee boxes are horrible and the fairways are even worse.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,This dissatisfaction of the whole day course what is the new electronic score card it was great but the problem I had was the automatic shut off I have a couple occasions where I went the opposite of the greens looking for a ball and the cart automatically shut down and it happened more than once which took more time than expected. It would have been more enjoyable if the electronic score board would’ve been explained to me at the beginning of the day.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"First and last time ever going to this course. Supposedly used to be nice years ago but wow have they given up entirely. Active construction on holes without mention, goat ranch fairways and tee boxes you can barely force a tee into, extremely patchy “greens” (more dirt and dead spots than green), dry as an absolute bone. I paid for 18 and left after 7 holes without taking a rain check because I will never return there. I actively deter people from wasting even $1 on this course, let alone $35 for a Tuesday morning."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Tee boxes need some work. Rough is rough! Great coarse and challenging
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Course was in awful shape, looked like they hadn’t mowed the tee boxes in a week. Rough looked like it wasn’t cut in 2 weeks. Sad because this course used to look great and seems they could care less now."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Course conditions were bad. grass needed mowed. Tall grass in the fairways. Greens were in good shape
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Tee boxes need cutting , grass growing in bunkers . need a lot of work"
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,This is the worst maintenance of a course I have seen! Only made it through two holes and realized that every fairway
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"First time at this course and was looking forward to it after everything I've heard.I bought a fox59 golf card and was only supposed to pay the $15 cart fee not the twenty I was charge, but hey a round for 20. Still very fair. The gentleman that checked me in and the cart attendant were both very nice.The course itself is in need of repair, just mow it. I lost 2 balls in the fairway just in long grass, get in the rough forget it and drop another. I could see it if we had ran through the past week but we haven't.I did not experience the same issue with the Carr except around the greens. They are equipped with gps and have borders around the greens, they slow way down so you don't drive on the green approaches. That's normal.Would have been a five star experience if not for the shape of fairways and roughs."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Unfortunately I have never seen a course with so many weeds. It appears to be lacking daily maintenance. Several divots on tee boxes and weeds everywhere. Very disappointing and will not be returning.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"I am only writing this because it is fact, this course is not worth time or money. Tees are OK, fairways non existent (burnt & brown) and greens good but to slow. The course is dead, worst I have seen it in years. Staff is great, atmosphere is excellent, course is non existent. Hard for me to write this because they need the play and the money, but it’s just not worth it."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Greens are good. Bunkers are horrible. Tee boxes not cut for days. Dandelions ( weeds) on every hole. I only paid $21 (cart included). If I paid more, I would have been very mad. I will not play thecourse again this year. Obviously struggling with income, and not enough money to get the course in shape. Too bad... Nice layout. Have played this course since mid 70s. It's sad to see it in such poor condition. I couldn't even take the golf cart off the cart path! If I drove off the cart path, the cart would automatically stop until i returned to path. I felt like I would have been better off if I just walked the course. Without fail, it felt like every hole where I missed the fairway, the cart path was completely on the other side. I did lots of walking with me and my cart partner. Twin bridges in Danville is well worth with the visit over this course in it's current condition and price point!"
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Friendly staff , pace of play great on front but got behind a 6 some on 12 & took 2 hrs for 6 holes . Coarse is better shape than last year ."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Tee boxes were terrible ! Long grass if any and that needed cut.The ruff was very long and needed cut.Greens were in good shape.The course has a great challenging layout.Nice cart path on the front nine but rough on the back.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Course hadn't been mown in several days. U.S. open rough on the tee boxes! No mention of green aeration - played about a 3 on a stimp meter due to shag carpet length grass on greens.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"They had recently aerated the greens which is our fault for not checking beforehand. However, they plugged them and left a lot of the plugs on the greens. They didn't use sand rather they used dirt which was now mud which made the greens unputtable. The grass on the tee boxes was so high that at times you couldn't put a tee in the ground. Fairways were torn up pretty bad too."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Just aerated, mud all over the greens. Tee boxes not mown. They should just shut this course down until they do renovations that are supposedly coming."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Fairways were dry and hard due to the lack of rain, but the greens were in good shape. Tee boxes need help, but manageable. The GPS system on the carts, showing the hole map, distance to the hole and how far it was to the water or other hazards and how far it would be to clear them, was a huge plus. For those who like to play music, you could also hook up your phone or play independent radio to their system."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Coarse is challenging and does have some water. Greens good shape.fairways not bad.This used to be very pristine course but not anymore. Still a decent value and fun place to play.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Played with a buddy I hadn't seen in a while. Tee boxes need attention. Grass was as high as the rough on some tees. Still had fun though. Staff was awesome. Will go back.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,played with my father so a quick twosome round. Nice pace of play. Course in much better condition than a year ago.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Went as a single and the staff paired me up with a great couple. Course was in great shape and I had a great time.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Tee boxes are junk. Course pace 3:10 minutes for 9 holes. Course Ranger, useless."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"This place calls itself a ""country club"" for some reason. Tee boxes were a joke, fairways full of weeds, green unkempt and bouncy, sand traps were actually outlined in white for a free drop since they were unplayable. One of the worst courses I've ever played. Oh, and the beers were $6/ea. to top it off. ""COUNTRY"" maybe. ""Club"", no way. Avoid at all costs."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"The course has potential to be an above average course. However, the course is not properly taken care of which truly holds back it's beauty. The sand traps are ""dirt traps"" and some of the tee boxes have recently been re-sodded so you are basically teeing off from the rough. The course has a nice layout and challenging holes and with some maintenance could be a great course. The staff is super friendly and the clubhouse is very clean and welcoming. The course itself just needs a little love."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"We had a blast plying at Prestwick, the course was challenging, but not impossible. Would definitely recommend playing here!"
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Great course! Was awesome outing had a lot of fun! Course is well maintained and had a great flow. Wasn't too difficult of a course which is nice because this was my first time out this season. Would 100% go back!
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"I’ve golfed at Prestwick a handful of times, this time was just over all not the best."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Hardly any cars were in the parking lot, but for some reason they did not have enough carts for everyone (alot just sitting in the barn). Ultimately it took us an hour to even get a cart, and another 20 minutes to tee off after our tee time."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Course conditions weren’t bad at all for being this early in the year. Only complaint I had was flopping my 60 degree out of a side green bunker, but busting it on a rock buried under the sand the size of a baseball. Completely scraped my Volkey wedge. I wasn’t thrilled."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Through golf now only payed $20 a golfer to play, so absolute great price since I’ve paid over $45 to play there before."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,I play this course 1 to 2 times a week and it's always amazing and so is the staff the only thing that's bad is the sand traps and sometimes you get rude players that have four that won't let you pass even though you're 1 player but you will have that everywhere can't wait to come back and play another round
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Expected a little more since it is a country club but for the amount I paid it was worth it
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Front nine fairways very patchyBack nine was betterTee box’s were a mess but playableI live in neighborhood and wish they had discountedPrices ..Kinda steep price for condition...Dead raccoon on hole #7 cart path.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Course layout is good.. course I’m REALLY bad shape. They said they have good food but it was dry and “ cafeteria like”. Course was in real good shape years and years ago . Sad to see it like this !!!
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Look, after reading all of the other reviews, I really dont want to beat a dead horse but....wow. The course conditions are beyond terrible, to the point it really doesnt qualify as a round of golf. No true bounces in the fairway. In fact I started aiming for the rough to find some grass, as there wasnt much in the fairways, and dont get me started on the lack of grass at literally EVERY tee box. Add all of this, and the fact you have the audacity to charge 41 bucks for a round at this goat ranch is highway robbery. 20 bucks at this point, based on the conditions alone, would also qualify as highway robbery. Dont make the same mistake I did, your better off hitting in your backyard than paying a dime to these folks."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,I hate to do this but I don’t want anyone to repeat my mistake.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Tee boxes and fairways were arguably the worst I’ve ever seen...that includes the $20 municipal courses I play all the time. Add that to paying $35 and that equals never going back.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Prestwick is what 2020 would look like if it was a golf course.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Let me start off by saying I am not a picky golfer. By that I mean that a course doesn’t not have to be anywhere close to perfect condition for me to have fun. Ultimately what I prefer in a course is a cool layout with holes that do not seem to repeat themselves. IMO the layout at Prestwick is awesome! I absolutely loved the design! We were having fun. The condition of the course is not good. By any means. We had made several comments about the tee boxes having little to no grass. The fairways were not much different. The greens were decent but were so hard that you couldn’t even get a wedge to hold. None the less we were having fun. Like I said, I’m not a picky golfer. Everything was fine and then RICHARD happened!"
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Here’s what happened.... Richard pulled up as we were finishing up on the 14th green and introduced himself as “the person that takes care of the course” and acknowledged that the course was not in very good shape. He then proceeded to tell us how he doesn’t even allow his employees to drive that close to the green. (We were parked in the rough 10-15 feet from the green). I admit that I was too close to the green. My playing partner apologized and said it won’t happen again. We thought that was the end of it as he returned to his cart but then he got very unfriendly and disrespectful and repeating himself and took it way too far. He was flat out rude! I admit we were too close to the green, but we apologized and said we wouldn’t do it again."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Needless to say, after that the fun was over and Richard had ruined the entire experience for us. Never in my life have been treated so poorly at a golf course as a paying customer. The course is in garbage condition. The design is really cool but with a guy like Richard in charge I fear it will just be a field of grass in a matter of time. If Prestwick doesn’t make a change in Richard’s position they will not last much longer."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Overall layout is good. Greens in decent shape, slower than neighboring courses. Fairways and tee boxes on the front 9 are atrocious. I shouldn’t be hitting off bare dirt in the fairways or having to find a spot in the tee box where there is sufficient grass to maintain my footing. If this course does not make a serious investment, I doubt it will survive much longer, which would be a shame as there are several nice homes on it."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Good Course but greens and fairways need work. Fun course to play and the price is great.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Tough track, but even tougher when fairways are patchy and the greens are also."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,I can not recommend this course to anybody. Hardly any grass on the fairways the t boxes are in terrible condition anthe greens is as hard as rock Do yourself a favor and play somewhere else .
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Great layout but course has been allowed to deteriorate. Tee boxes are awful and fairways in mediocre condition. Greens fair at best.Could be a great course with proper maintenance.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"I make it a point to play Prestwick once a season since it became public 3 years ago. It was in rough condition then, yet showed some solid improvement since."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Forward to yesterday/this year and the progress is substantial. The entire team at the club must be recognized for the effort and results. Work remains, but the trend line is notably up. Looking forward to returning already"
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,This course has a good deal of challenging holes. It requires you to hit a good drive and have a mid iron into most greens. The greens are true and roll well that would be the best feature of the course. The rough was thick and requires some strength to get a quality shot towards the green. I am not complaining and for the competitive golfer she/he would appreciate the challenges. The course was not too busy for a mid-morning tee time. The price was fair and didn’t break the bank for a round. I will definitely play Prestwick again.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"The heat index was over 100 so it was nearly unbearable. However, no wait times. Course was in ok shape. A couple of the greens could've been better maintained. However, the staff was the most friendly I'd ever encountered on a public course. The clubhouse guy was overly nice. The greens keeper or the club pro thanked me for filling my divot. Class acts all around. As a Brownsburg resident, I am going to try to play there more often just because of that."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Layout is very good. Course has has several holes with some nice land movement. The back 9 was my favorite of the two 9s.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Conditions were not the best, but for the price I paid it was worth the play."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"You can tell they are working on it but its still fairly rough. Tee boxes are terrible, traps are hard, and fairways in areas still need some love. I don't believe there was a ball washer on the entire course. Positive note is the greens were very nice. The course is nice and once they get it turned back around I'm sure it will be great but right now I cant imagine I would go back unless the deal was super cheap."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"A wonderful resource for Avon, Continue supporting because I see dramatic improvement over the last couple of years. It will continue to improve and will return to its former glory."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Played this course today for the first and last time. Condition of the tee boxes and fairways was pretty bad. Greens were decent but not holding wedge shots. The pace of play was not good as there were a bunch of singles behind a very slow threesome that finally decided to let folks play through. The staff was the best thing I experienced at this course. Very friendly and accommodating. Perhaps I’d try again if course conditions were to vastly improve. For now though, it’s one and done."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"We were so excited to play the one time private COUNTRY CLUB—- WOW were we disappointed!! Absolutely nothing about the place feels country clubish. The parking lot is in disrepair and the clubhouse and the golf paths, it’s a money pit and I wish the ownership/mgmt good luck. I don’t believe the fairway are watered, if they are it was pathetic.The only, and I mean only, saving grace was the pace of the greens— very good and rolled well; but trying to hold one with a perfectly played wedge was nearly impossible. I was not a fan at all of the layout— drive a golf cart across a busy road TWICE—really. And #9 is a joke- can’t hit driver (from our tees) because of a lake on a Par 5–again really!!If this place is in GOOD condition, as some of the recent reviews state, it must have been a true goat ranch before!! Don’t let the other reviews fool you— it is NOT worth the price under any circumstances.Everything about the place is old and run down!!Honestly I was embarrassed in how poor the place was and I’d never even been there before—- but never again!!WOW."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"If you haven’t played here in the past couple of years, please add this to your list of courses to play. I do not work there and my only ties to this course, other than playing it in college, would be the random member guest tournaments over the years. Now that it is public and under new management, the improvements are obvious."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"I’m not quite sure where the prior reviews are coming from but these might be the best greens in central Indiana. Even under extremely wet conditions, the fairways look nice and the staff is extremely friendly. Since this used to be a private country club, you definitely get that feel by the bar/restaurant and other amenities once you walk in."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"The only negatives are that the tee boxes could use a little bit of work, either re-sod or pay extra attention to them. The Teebox should not be long or have weeds. If they could make them look anywhere like fairways, they would have something. The driving range is also lacking with no distance markers and also not mowed very tight or level. Lastly the bunkers need some attention which they are admittedly doing. Once those three things get up to the quality of the rest of the course over the summer, I wouldn’t be surprised if they attempted to go back to private.."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"The layout is more of a shot making course and a little tight but once you get to the greens, you’re in for a treat. Smooth and fair. Easy to read and a lot of fun. As someone who relies on reviews before I play places, please ignore the negative and old ones as much as you can and just give it a shot. For $35, it is the best value around."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,course is vastly improving. greens rollinggood. fairways rolling and rough is still challenging. again main drawback would be the tee boxes. kudos to the continued improvement with course..also would be helpful if players would either replace fairway divots or repair divots with sand provided in carts. finally water should be provided on course particularly as summer heats up.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"For those that don't know, Prestwick was closed for 2 years but there is a GREAT management company trying to revive what was left-for-dead. Tee boxes are sketchy (and non-existent for women). Front 9 plays between homes & is mundane. Back 9 is beautiful & a great layout. It was a good-value overall & I hope they can return it to it's glorious past - but it can't happen overnight. I'll consider a revisit next season."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"To start I have never written a review for a course and felt like I needed to send a warning to others but as a casual golfer take this for what it's worth. As a casual golfer I truly want to enjoy the environment on the course. Upon arrival we were told cart path only which is understandable with the rain as of late but I wish we were advised of the course conditions as well. The first couple were definitely soggy but after it was definitely dry enough to run a mower through. With the 8"" tall dandelions blanketing the roughs to the so called grass of the fairways I'm not sure if I could even call this a golf course. With the torn apart tee boxes to the abysmal fairways and the dead spot ridden greens I was truly disappointed in the whole experience. When you get to the point of not even wanting to give the back nine a chance and decide to call it quits you know there is a problem. I truly wish this course the best and hope they can get back to the reputation and conditions I have heard of the past but until then I can gaurantee I will not set foot back on that property."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"To start I have never written a course review and my trip to this course justified a warning to others. I'm just a casual golfer but I like being able to enjoy the environment I'm in and this course was an extreme disappointment. Before we started we were told cart path only which is understandable with the rain as of late but when we got on the course it was worse than I could imagine. Nothing was anywhere close to being cut and looked like it's been that way for a while. With 8"" tall dandelions blanketing the roughs to the so called grass of the fairways I'm not sure how it's in such bad shape. After the first 2 it was plenty dry enough to run a mower through but I'm not sure if they have a grounds crew. When the grass at my house is nicer than any ground I touched on the course I was truly disappointed. With the torn apart tee boxes to the abysmal fairways I am positive I will not return. I truly wish this course the best and hope they get back to the reputation and condition I have heard of the past but when I was too disappointed to even finish the course after the front nine I can gaurantee I will not step foot back on that property. Take this for what it's worth but I am certainly disappointed."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Transformation from private to public has been hard on Prestwick however it has improved since last year. Once catch up on mowing it will be pretty good. I will play it again.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Prestwick is in the best shape in 20 years. Play it while it is in great shape. Cart paths need attention along with some sand traps. Other than that it is in very good shape. Rough is kinda long but it is there to punish errant shots. Who knows what the hot weather will do to the course so play it now
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Prestwick has had a complete 180 turnaround from last year. It’s in much better shape. The carts needed sand filled bottles was all and no water coolers yet on the course but I would definitely continue playing here regularly. Love the pace of play here has never been a problem.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"I called ahead before booking to ask about their greens, because I had heard that some you couldn't even putt on. They told me they were fine except for 15, which has a temporary green or fairway hole. There were several greens that were not worth the time to putt on, especially on the back 9. It is early in the season so hopefully they will get them into shape, otherwise fairways were pretty decent, tee boxes really need some work."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Usually nice. Nov. 7, 2018 was bad. Person at desk said they were starting at 18 and aerating. Front was nice except tee boxes and rough weren't mowed. Got to 13 and the guy was on the green aerating. We were getting ready to hit up to the green and he yelled at us. ""What are you doing?"" he said in a loud, angry voice. Had to jump around and next two greens were plugged, not cleaned off, and no cup! Worker said we could skip around and play holes that weren't aerated! We left without playing 3 holes! Weren't told any of this at check-in! Bad experience! We took a friend who had never played there!"
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"I played this course today for the first time in over 20 years. My level of disappointment was high, to say the least. This used to be a beautiful layout and a pristine course. To call it a goat ranch today is disservice to the goats. The greens are diseased and filled with bare spots, most of the tees are chewed up and unplayable, The range was abysmal.I know this course has been through receivership and is under new management and they are trying to get it back, but they have a long, long road ahead. IMO, they should close it for a couple of years and totally rebuild it. To continue to take people's money is somewhat dishonest, IMO. The pro told me a ""couple"" of the greens had some problems. A couple ?? How about most of them ? There was no mention of the horrible tees and the crabgrass-filled fairways. If you've got an extra $ 40 to spend, be my guest. I won't play it again."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"I’m a casual golfer who has had the opportunity to play at a number of courses in Indiana, around the country, and some internationally. I played at Prestwick yesterday with a good friend who recently relocated to the area. While my “hot deal” made this a great price I would have preferred to play elsewhere for the extra $15. The course itself was in rough condition with many of the greens suffering from some kind of disease. The tee boxes were also in rough shape and regularly throughout the fairways you would see crab grass and other issues sprouting up. I would say my lawn is receiving more attention than the course in terms of weed prevention. It was a balmy day with high temps and very high humidity yet not a single water station actually had water. When we made the turn we stopped in for refreshments (obviously with the temps and lack of water) and sat at the bar in the lounge area for 10 minutes before I had to go find someone to take our order."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Overall, I would not recommend this course to anyone until they’ve had a chance to tackle some of the issues with the course. The other issues are just a matter of keeping the staff on task - service, etc. I could see this course being a nice place to go but they won’t receive any of my money until I’ve received word from a trusted source that they’ve buttoned up several issues."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"This course recently changed from private to public. The first tee box should have been a sign of what was to come. There was grass, but it was mostly crab grass. Things was the norm for all of the teeboxes. The fairways had many burnt/dead spots. The tee boxes and fairways were golfing heaven compared to the greens. All of the greens had significant dead spots that were down to bare soil. The worst were at least 50% covered with these spots."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,I gave up trying after 13 holes. There was no point in playing well tee to green to be sabotaged by the horrifically maintained greens.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Avoid this course. The layout is very nice. It could be a great course, but the greensare in such bad shape that it will take numerous growing seasons to get them to playable."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"This was the foursomes first time playing this course. We were all very disappointed. It had the potential to be good. The lack of attention really showed. We played Saddlebrook Golf Course which was closed for two years and only open for 2 months, and it was in better shape. I don't think the staff can get it back to good playing conditions with the continued heat. It was definitely not worth the drive."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"I have lived in central Indiana for a while now and was pleasently surprised to find Prestwick on GolfNow. I booked a tee-time for 12:27 and when arrived to check in and warm up discovered that the course did not open until 11:30. No morning tee times at all? Then, it was not told to me that they were not playing the back 9 as the greens were being airrated and under repair. It took me losing two balls and looking like a complete idiot to make that realization. The course needs work. I get it, it was a Monday, but it looked like they were ready to close the doors for good! Probably not playing the course again."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Tee boxes with shaggy grass and lots of bald spots. Fairways dry and half brown, not much descent green grass. Most greens in poor shape with large cracking dry and dead brown spots and bare spots with nothing but dirt. Temperature in the low 90’s and no drinking water in the water stations. Course personnel indifferent when told of this. I would not go back and play this course for free and was reimbursed for my gas to get there. Golfnow is damaging it’s credibility by even listing Prestwick. I gave it one star because there was no place for a zero."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Course in fairly good condition. Greens reasonably quick and rolling true. Fringe areas well groomed and manicured. Only drawback was tee boxes left a lot to be desired. This course is well designed by Mr. Simmons as were his other projects at the Pointe, Valle Vista and Green Acres in Kokomo. Kudos to the managing company in having this course in decent shape. Hope efforts continue."
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"Great to see this course still open ... while no longer a private track, Prestwick is more accessable and still just as fun. Still needs a little TLC from a maintenance perspective, but the layout is both challenging and enjoyable. Will definitely return!"
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,Course is very interesting and in great shape! 2nd time I've played it. Staff is super friendly! Can't say anything bad about this experience! Lucky to get to play it! Rick Ferguson
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,This used to be very prestine now not so much. Greens a little bare here and there and fairways not very well groomed. The outer rouhg very tall and thick. Hard to find ball. Still a nice course needing attention.
Prestwick Country Club,5643-prestwick-country-club,"This course has really declined in conditions recently. The staff is not friendly in the slightest, and makes you feel as though you are an inconvenience to them. They do not take care of the greens and let the fairways burn out each year in July. Do not waste your time playing this course."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,An opportunity for you to use each club in your Bag. The Greens are in good shape and challenging. All trees are set to challenge your handicap no matter your age or level of play.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Everybody I encountered on the course was very friendly and patient. 9AM Tee Time on a Wednesday morning as a single was a bit odd. I caught up with two older women and they let me play through to join the group in front of them. Course was in good shape and got better as the greens dried off later in the morning. Bunkers in good locations and some challenging long par 3's.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Slow play caused mostly by tee times being stacked 8 minutes apart. We teed off at 10:00am and it was already 10 minutes behind schedule and took 5hrs 10minutes to play. If you are going to do 8 minute tee times you need to put in one empty tee time every 4th tee time at least.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,The course is in good shape with greens that rolled true. Fairways were in great shape a very interesting layout that keeps things exciting and the staff was great.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Excellent course and extremely kind staff. Always willing to accommodate!⛳️
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Great Course and bar staff. If you walk 18 give yourself at least 4.5 hours to do 18 holes.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Good pace of play. Course was in great shape and the flowers, etc around the club house are just beautiful. The map and yardage on the carts about each hole is nice."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Just visiting the area, and was so pleased with River Glen. Good conditions, good layout, good challenge with the sloping greens. Will plan to play there again!"
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Didn’t like that they sent a group off in front of us on #10. Pace of play was great until that happened
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Awesome course, great condition and one of my local favorites"
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Course is in good condition, Starter is a fantastic guy and remainder of staff is friendly. However, the front 9 took over 3 HOURS to play. A foursome ahead of us had never played golf. No ranger in sight. Outside of my twosome, nobody to tell them to speed up play.Very frustrating, leaves a bad taste."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Great Course. Really good condition. Worth the cost.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Great track. Challenging greens, and the course was in great shape. Highly recommend"
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,A 3 hour 9 holes is insane. No beverage cart service and average course conditions. Wouldn’t go back.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,I do not understand the reviews on here that put this course lower than 4.5. Except maybe the slow pace but there was hardly anyone there. lolBut I’ve nothing at all bad to say about this course. Everything from the tee beds to the greens were exceptionally good. The course layout great. Challenging but fair. Great friendly staff. All around great day of golf. Highly recommend and will be back.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Awesome course. Challenging but still playable for the average golfer. Each hole was scenic and the course was in mint condition in the middle of October
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,One of the last really nice days to play golf. Dwindling temperatures and daylight. I felt like everyone had the same idea I did to try to get 18 in. So pace of place was pretty slow on the front we started 30 minutes behind our tee time. But once things got going we had a nice day on the course.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"The course is pretty and in good shape. But even on a Mid-morning Wednesday when the tee time sheet was not full, the play was slow. There were a lot of foursomes of old men who just move slow and take their good sweet time with no regards to pace of play. Even though we skipped the tenth hole at the turn to get in front of a couple of groups, we still had over a 5 hour round."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"A starter/course Marshall would be highly beneficial as some groups ahead of us were completely oblivious to reasonable pace of play standards. Also, I witness many golfers from this region who do not repair pitch marks or rake bunkers which is inexcusable. Keep moving and take care of the course people!"
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,I really love the river terrain and great views on this course. The staff is aways great and I like the grill setup for a quick burger or dog at the turn. I'm not sure if there was an outing the day before but the greens had a bunch of unrepaired or poorly repaired divots. Pace of play was rough with a 10 minute late tee off followed by a 4 hour:40 minute round.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,It was extremely busy that day and the staff were excellent considering the circumstances
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Really enjoyed the course. Hooked up with a group of three. Course was in excellent condition. Greens and fairways were great. Will be back asap.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Really like this golf course. I’ve played it a handful of times and every time the play is unbearably slow!! I was part of a threesome and it took us 5 hours to play. Behind.a 4some who wouldn’t let us through and we waited on just about every shot. Suggestion: put a ranger on the course and space the tee times a little more. Definitely will choose other courses moving forward.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,This was my first time playing this course and I found it to be a real mixed bag of conditions and challenges. The overall condition of the course is pretty natural but maintained. The layout is fun with only a handful of “gimmicky” holes or simply ones that make you say “what were they thinking here”?? It was Sunday of Father’s Day so I was expecting a 5hr. round and was not disappointed. and not sure what a normal day would play like. Overall I would play this course again.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Course is in great shape, pace of play on hot weekend mornings has been excellent back to back weeks, and it’s a great deal for the price"
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Staff very polite, had our reservationsTees goodFairways very goodGreens fair and all same speed,quickBunkers goodCarts have no windshields a negative"
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Awesome track, the only negative would be that some of the greens were a little beat up, but I think that is more on the players not fixing their ball marks."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Everything was great except for the pace. Took 4+ hours to play.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"River Glen is a jewel of a course and should be considered the top course in the greater Carmel, Indiana area. Always a pleasure to play and it offers a good challenge every round."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Well manicured, great layout, I hit every Club in the back. Each hole very different. Back 9 has more water."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"2:20 min for the first 8 holes. Very slow. Hopefully this replaces my last review, I can't math."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,3 hrs for 7.5 holes so far.....course needs a ranger bad
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,So…I’ve now lived in Fishers for more than 20 years. I can’t count how many times I’ve played at River Glen…but this will be my last. First…I check in the young guy behind the counter greets the gentlemen in front of me with a Good Morning…he greets me with a What’s Up. Next …the ranger harasses us on 3 different occasions and tell us we have to pick it up….at this point we’re leaving the tee…the group behind us is still in their fairway. The second time …he warns the 2 some we’re playing with ..we’re waking onto the green..the group behind us is on the tee….385yrds away (side note: we had to wait on the tee of the previous mentioned hole because the group in front of us had to take a pee break in the bushes). He then follows us around for a free additional holes not saying anything just watching…at this time…we have a whole hole lead on the group behind us. Now…I hate to take it to a “race thing” but me and my playing companion are black…and just about every time I’ve played here..I’ve had an issue (once heard someone refer to me as “colored” also…had a ranger about 10 years ago watch me hit a drink and said that “I hit that ball like Tiger Woods” So…with all that being said …even though I live 7 mins from the course ….I’LL NEVER PLAY RIVER GLEN AGAIN!!!!
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Been here 4 or 5 times and each time it has gotten significantly slower. Wish we were sent off the back since it was clear and the front it took 2 hours 40 mins to play on a Monday evening. Love the course and people though.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"This course is so so much fun but you gotta put the ball in good spots ! Can’t hit driver off every tee , iron play must be good ! The greens were slick but a bit beat up from others not repairing their ball marks ! It is definitely a must play ! I am going to try to go weekly for my mid week practice round !!"
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Their cart does not provide a windshield. It was brutal during fall and early spring weather.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"River Glen always provides a good challenge, great course conditions and a fun round of golf. I think it is the best value in the Carmel, Indiana area and love playing here. Do yourself a favor and play this great course."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Beautiful course with good difficulty level for a beginner. Went on a Saturday with perfect weather, so the pace was rushed."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,This course is very nice. Nothing wrong with the course. Its a nice layout that is well maintained. The staff is nice and helpful as well. I can't give the course a better rating because the pace of play is awful! Its achingly slow. The reason is the old women playing slow and unwilling to let anyone play thru! So...just know...if plan on playing there...the 4hr 15 minute pace of play shown on the card is just a guide that probably won't be met.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,It took us over 5 hours to play the course and didn’t get to tee off on time tee’d off 20 minutes late for our tee time due to the slow pace golfing. The green had many bump causing the ball not to role well at all.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"River Glen never fails to impress. Great course and best value in and around Carmel, Indiana."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,I just don’t think you can go wrong playing River Glen. It is a great course with plenty of challenge and the course is in really good condition. The only complaint I have is that some of the greens appear to show some wear at this point in the season. Probably due to all of the heat. Otherwise it was a great day!
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Carts on pathBunkers full of water unplayableGreens look to have been vertical-cutGreens rolled better then they lookedAll of course very lush, fairways and tees excellentCould use better signs getting thru homes to next tee box on front sideWill be back on drier day"
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Took 3 hours to play 9, so I couldn’t and didn’t want to get 18 in for the day."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,I will always play this course very enjoyable love the layout of holes
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Slow play, ball marks not fixed. Staff / owners obviously don’t care. Hot deal rate helps fill tee times. Would never pay the rack rate."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"I amd my partner really enjoyed our play this moring, good pace and weather with course condition!"
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Really enjoyed the course, food and staff. Only drawl back was the pace of play. Round took over five hours to complete and I’m not sure we saw a ranger on the course."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"I love River Glen. I think the course is my favorite in the greater Carmel/Fishers/Zionsville/Westfield area. However, the sand traps need some work. A few are fairly fluffy, but the rest are like hitting off concrete. The greens are fast, challenging and fair, but they are getting a bit worn and a lot of areas are showing what appears to be “fungus” damage. Plus, far too many players just don’t fix ball marks. These are minor things overall and should not dissuade anyone from playing this really fun, beautiful course!"
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"River Glen never disappoints. The course conditions are excellent, and the course offers a good challenge. I always love to play this venue."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Course was backed up from first tee. Prepare for 6hr round.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Great course, excellent condition, quick greens. I like that they keep upgrading the course!"
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Overall a terrific experience great staff at River Glen course in great condition will play again
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Very slow rate of play. Single foursome holding up 6 groups behind. Ranger/clubhouse was no help.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Visiting from out of town, I’d definitely recommend this course. Greens and fairways in great shape, and the rough was very playable. We were the second group to tee off, so the course was still quite wet from the evening dew, but things warmed/dried up."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Was really impressed with the condition of the course. As mentioned by others, the 8 minute spacing between groups is pretty tight, and we had a twosome chasing us the whole round."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Just 4 holes surrounded by houses, which is always a concern for me as a new golfer. But fairways are pretty wide, and appreciated."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"I love this course. Its where I learned to golf, however, I hardly ever go to this course unless it’s the only place available. The pace of play is horrendous. They jam pack the course with tee times every 7 or 8 minutes. There are 3 groups on nearly every hole. This course needs to chill out with tee times so close together. It’s a gem, but it’s unplayable with the way they jam people on to the course"
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Where to start… amenities… ball washers, trash cans, yardage books on every cart, bathrooms on each 9, yardage markers… you feel good paying money to play here. Staff…employees are awesome from the pro shop to the cart barn to the course keepers, superintendent, and his pup….to the bartenders and starters."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"River Glenn is a top 5 golf course and experience on a golf course in this city. Secluded, however a couple holes have houses to keep your game honest, I like it. It plays along the White River so when your game sucks at least that’s awesome.It’s simple enough to see how many different ways you can play it but equally difficult to ruin ever plan you had. Precision beats power here and I love that."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Play here all the time if you can, help take care of it, and test your game."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"My only critique is the greens need some work. They were playable but in rougher shape than what you would expect from this course. Otherwise, I had a great experience here and recommend. Price is more than fair."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Lovely course with a friendly staff. Not much more you could want. I was able to play as a single starting around 440 or so and several groups let me play through, I just got stuck behind a foursome from 15-18 but otherwise pace of play was way better than expected and everyone treated me with respect while I was there. Can’t wait to return!"
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Beautiful fall colors (several balls lost on holes 6 - 9, probably under a pile of leaves). We were middle set of 3 2-some a and found ourselves waiting particularly on #4 - 6. A female 2-some came up to us on #7 tee box looking for #5 - but hey, I’ve gotten off track myself on other courses! The bridges and tee boxes were in pristine condition. Beautiful, challenging front 9. I’ll book it again!"
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Fantastic course-great topography and very scenic. Sprinklers were on during play and had to play around them.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Great course just always takes 5 hours to play. No need to book tee times so close. Get rangers out to help with pace when needed. Price isn't bad. Some greens could use help. Just please find a way to speed it up
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,The layout is nice. Good variety of holes. The course was pretty well maintained. Staff was nice. My only quibble is the pace of play. If you get stuck behind one of the geriatric groups…as I did…it is going to seem like it takes forever to play the course.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"I have played this course about once every month or two over the last three years. It’s convenient and was priced right and the staff is good. Over the last yearish there has been a perceptible decline in the condition of the greens. I understand that the course probably gets a lot of play and there are a lot of jerks out there that don’t do their part, but there also a lot of poorly replaced cups. At this point it’s more like a $45 course instead of a $60 course."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,The course itself was amazing and had good challenges and was well taken care of. I am certainly coming back to golf there. The only downside (which is no fault to the course) the group of 4 in front of me were playing multiple balls from the tee and held up myself (1-some) and another 4-some.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Even after the heavy rain fall the course played well with little water visible. Can’t wait to play this course against
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,The course does not drain real well as it is low. The greens were not as good as in the past. They should put sand on the carts for divot repairs as there were a number of unfilled divots.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Course layout is pathetic.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,The course was in perfect condition. It appears that a good amount of their bunkers were recently renovated- they were filled with beautiful crushed limestone. The greens were soft but rolled fast. I can't wait to get out on their course again soon!
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,I’ve played river glen 3-4 times per year over the last several years and have always enjoyed my round. It’s a good course.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"This was my first time playing here this year and the greens seem significantly more beat up this year than previous years. Not only ball marks (not sure what, if anything can be done about that) but numerous previous cup locations had not healed as well as other area courses at a similitude price point. # 7 immediately comes to mind. I like the added bunkering!"
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Course is in great shape. Good challenge and in my view best value for the money charged. Great fun and beautiful layout.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Very friendly staff. Nice layout. While pace was slow. Being a warm Sunday. Expected.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,It was such a pleasant course with hills and wonderful trees! It was difficult at times which made for a great competitive game!
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"I love River Glen. The course is challenging, but fair. It is very well maintained and is beautiful along the White River. Excellent value for the money and puts a lot of private courses to shame."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Great day, the course is well worth the money. Great layout and pretty good condition for so early in the season. Will be back for sure!"
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"I've lived close to this course for 3 years but this is my first time playing. This course is local, fairly easy with a couple of challenging hole, quiet and nice layout. 7 minutes between tee time looks a bit too close, but there was not many people out there due to wet weather. I am willing to come back, but $55 per person seems a bit pricey for this course."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Slow pace of play, especially for the amount of green fee. Great course layout. Greens need some TLC (many bumps, unrepaired marks)."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,I played with two nice young guys there was a foursome in front of us playing from the Blue tees. Three of the four of them were hacking away and looking for their first balls near the women’s tee box etc. Food for thought move to the WHITE tees like the rest of us. They completely had course backed up
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Course was over booked and had to wait in line for 30 minutes and carts were out of battery and had to change twice to get going. I couldn't play 18 holes due to poor logistics.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Loved the course and should have been maintained well.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"The aeration closed the back nine, and it looked like the front had just got finished that morning. Greens were basically unplayable. Very bumpy. Not worth the $36 today, but can see it being a nice course when not having just been worked on."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"If you like to wait 5 minutes or longer for every single shot, then this is the place for you. I don't know why the pace of this course is so slow ... but after a while, it gets to be really aggravating. The guy we played with had to leave after 9 holes because it was getting too late for him. Otherwise, it is a nice course, nice layout, and the greens and fairways were in really good condition. The course is dry on the edges but what course isn't in Indiana right now. Dollar hot dogs were great!"
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,They seem to consistently overbook tee times so the pace of play is REALLY slow. That's the only knock on this course.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,My foursome showed up to a double booked 3:15 tee time. We were told on hole 2 that we needed to “hurry up” and play quicker. It was unfortunate that my beautiful day of golf turned into us all skipping a hole completely (suggested by the employee who greeted us on hole 2) in order to compensate for the course's over scheduled day. There was an outing at the same time that we were not a part of. I had been to this course 3x in the past month with no problems but this particular round was one of the worst. A true waste of my money for the group/company.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Usually enjoy playing RG. Group of SIX! in front of us our two would not let us play thru made for a miserable experience. Course was also in poor condition.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,River Glen used to be a nice course but poor management and horrendous grounds keeping has turned it into a goat ranch. Don't waist your time and money!
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Love River Glen. It is a challenging course and is in excellent condition. The practice facilities are top notch and the various Tee boxes offer all levels of golfers a challenge. Will come here again and again!
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,I like River Glen but the t times were 8 min apart w many slow groups. Waited on ever hole. Very frustratingly. Pair up 2-somes! Space out t times so there Ian consistent times !! This has been problem in past.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"I don’t know how many times I have driven past this course over the years always wanting to play. Even after reading other reviews about slow play I figured it was time to see what this course has to offer. Got an early tee time hoping to get ahead of the rush. Much to my surprise on the morning of my tee time it, forecast stated spotty showers. I thought, man I was in luck, I don’t mind golfing in the occasional sprinkle and most people would just rather stay dry. It wasn’t even the third hole where we started coming up in slow groups and things started piling up from there. We even saw a ranger driving around, but not quite sure what his function was since he never asked anything and just drove past. I could only imagine how the day would’ve gone in a sunny day. Would like to play the course again and love the layout but staff needs to get pace of play under control I don’t see me going back anytime soon."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"It’s been a couple years since I’ve played River Glen. The upgrades to the course are excellent! I like that they’ve flipped the front and back 9, the course is in great shape."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Good course but play was slow. No starter/ranger to keep play moving. .
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Golf shop could be more interactive to increase purchases. Bar staff was very friendly. Course okay wasn’t terrible. Slow on the back 9 but not terrible. Course looked fantastic!
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Love the area and the golf is good. The bar is awesome and adds to the whole experience.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"I booked online using GolfNow but when I showed up to check in I was told that they had construction on the front nine and we would need to skip a hole or two. The guy behind me was offered the price of green fee and cart for 9 instead of 18. I asked the gentlemen behind the counter what that would be and he said $30. I told him that I paid $37.50 per player and he said that there was nothing he could do because it was a hot deal with Golf Now. When I arrived at the 1st tee I was told that another group had a 10 o’clock tee time (same as me) and they were waiting to tee off. There was no starter and no one to dispute the the argument. We had long waits due to work on course cart paths and had to skip a hole as well as tee off from a distance less than a normal par 3. on another. Very disappointed in the management and scheduling of course updates. Probably would have asked for my money back ( paid $112 for 3 some) and played at a different course, but one guy traveled 90 minutes and the other 45 minutes. Course was pretty good but employees couldn’t have care less about their customers and why construction in the middle of peak times. Frustrated..."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,There was no starter or ranger to keep the pace moving
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Got to play with a buddy out here a couple days ago and I can honestly say the course is in the best shape it’s been in a while. Greens are rolling pure even with all of the play the course has been getting over the past couple months.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Me and a couple buddies played here last Saturday. And glad we did. Beautiful course and fast pace of play. To top it off, staff was real accommodating and friendly. We will be back! Thanks RG."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"I have played River Glen for years and have always enjoyed it. They’ve invested significant resources the last few years to increase the complexity of the layout and improve the drainage around areas that previously held water. If it’s been a few years since you’ve played here, it’s time to come back. Golf is in high demand right now as it’s one of the few recreation activities that has remained open with social distancing and stay at home orders that have been in place. So, courses are seeing more rounds than previous years. Despite all this, RG is incredibly well-maintained and the pace is on par to what you’ll find at any other comparable course in the area right now."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Love the course. Pace of play is an issue.Rangers could easily fix this
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Started around 1145 with 1115 tee time. They packed the golfers in like sardines, which resulted in 18 holes taking 6 hours. They waited so long between mowing that the fairways were basically covered in hay."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"First time playing this course, and I have to say it was a good challenge. Long par 3’s and 5’s mixed in, and good course conditions for our weather lately. Greens played really fast on the front, seemed to slow on the back, however it did rain for 5 minutes or so, which helped I'm sure. Overall had a good time, and only donated a few balls to the golf gods, which is always a plus."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,My experience here today was nothing short of amazing! First off I played my best round of golf ever! The greens were amazing and the fairways were a blessing to me today. Simply a all around amazing day at River Glen! Most definitley reccomend playing here!
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Good course. In good shape for April after a long rain overnight and morning. Good place to play while Marion Co is closed.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Course was in good shape, greens And fairways were fresh cut and it has some cool hole layouts with elevation changes. Played solo with the pandemic, Got stuck behind a foursome of guys that wouldn’t let me play through, their pace of play was brutal, definitely weren’t playing ready golf. Outside of that is give the course a 4.5 out of 5."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,This is a beautiful course. Great amenities and great practice areas. The worst thing about this course is the sloooow play. The course stacks groups on top of each other but doesn't really inforce quick play. We watched groups in front of us literally play their same shots over and over. We called a ranger at one point but nothing changed in the pace of play.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Beautiful day on a great course.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Will look forward to playing there more in the future
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,I was visiting my Son on a visit from Florida. I booked the round via Golf Now based on previous reviews and proximity to where my Son lives (Fishers).
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Because I was traveling and really dislike traveling with clubs, I rented a set. I have been golfing and renting equipment for over 50 years and, by far, the clubs I was given were the worst I have ever seen. The set was not matched, clubs were also in poor condition. The set I was given was missing a putter which, unfortunately, I didn't notice until putting the first hole."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"The conditions of the Greens on the course was nothing less than ""atrocious"".I had paid for two people, 18 holes but, gave up after playing only 9."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,I would NOT recommend this course to anyone!
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,First time I've played here and wont be the last. Challenging holes and mature trees everywhere. Really enjoyed the round today.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,We had to play the front twice because the back was going to take 3 plus hours. No one at the course seemed to care. They booked an outing AND stacked up tee times.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,First time playing the course.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Was in great shape and just a beautiful day. Go play it for sure and I’m looking forward to many more rounds here.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"river glen is a bit secluded off busy allisonville road in fishers. It is a great parkland layout with lots of mature trees, well placed bunkers and undulated greens. Its one of my favorite layouts in the city. There has been some minor water damage that affects both the fairways and greens, so the course isn't in pristine shape, but still very playable. The bunkers could use bit more sand and work, but I feel like I am really splitting hairs. This is a top 10 course in the city, and I wouldn't hesitate to make it my home track."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Over the years, I’ve played this course many times. The course is in the best condition ever. Tees, fairways and greens superb (though somewhat slow this day). Looking forward to the next round."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Bgreat condition. Greens accessible and not too fast. Fun course.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"River Glen is in solid shape from tee to green. Greens were very slippery and rolled true. Rough was very lush, and had to hunt for balls even 1 bounce off the fairway."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"The course itself is a little pricey but has a decent layout. Lots of doglegs, so position matters off the tee. It's a course you need to play a few times to know the way around. Not a fan of how the 1st and 5th greens back into one another. The last 4 holes that are in the neighborhood are unlike the previous ones that are in the river bed, though the river isn't ever in play (a few ponds and streams are though). Definitely bring your bug spray for the holes by the river!"
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,Overall it's not in the league of its neighbor across the river (Prairie View) but it's worth a go for the good conditions.
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"Fun layout, excellent condition, friendly staff. This is not a very talked about course but it should be. Some of the fairways were being revamped on the front 9 but they rerouted some holes around it and you can't blame a course for making improvements. I can't wait to go back when it's all complete."
River Glen Country Club,5727-river-glen-country-club,"I played four rounds here this past weekend and was very impressed with my experience. The course was in great shape. You're forced to work the ball right to left and left or right. All of the greens were sloped back to front, so you must make sure that you are below the hole or three putts will be very common. The facilities were very nice, although the practice area could be a little better. Staff was very friendly and helpful. The selection in their tavern was a little limited. On Fridays they have beer, brats, burgers, and hot dogs for $1.50 each. You can beat that!!!"
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Course is in great shape. Bunkers are the only knock, but just don’t hit in them!"
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,The course was in decent condition. The greens had recently been aerated but there were also a lot of ball marks on the greens. The bunkers also all need sand.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,You can tell this superintendent cares about the well being of the facility. Obviously loves what he does. Very good for the long ball hitters.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Very impressed with this course always a challenge. Enjoy every hole great design one of my favorites!
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Golf Course was in good shape. Pace of play was good. Enjoyed it.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Our twosome went off first and had a nice round. The course was in very good condition and we really enjoyed the course layout. We were unfamiliar with the nine holes we were playing and had a bit of difficulty with water and sand hazards. Our bad on that, we should have done a better job researching. Regardless, we had a great time and will be back to play again."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Very beautiful course. Cool layout and did not seem crowded.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,The three different 9 hole courses each bring a different feel and unique challenges. It mixes up the experience each time... don't forget a hot dog at the turn. Best around!
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,I greatly prefer playing the Lakes 9 hole course at Ironwood. It's a nice course overall. I do wish they would have ball washers on some holes. They also didn't have any restroom options while out on the course nor any cold water jugs on a blistering day. I'm glad I brought my own water!
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Great layout, 3 9’s. Scenic. Nice clubhouse and food/beverage options. Highly recommend."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Have played quite a few times over the years. Played the Lake and Ridge courses. I would say the lake course was not in the best of shape on the tee boxes and greens. Some of the tee boxes looked like they had been used like a driving range. The greens had a lot of non repaired divots in them. The ridge course I thought was in good shape overall. Greens and fairways looked good.. Hopefully as the season goes on the Lake course will improve.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Course was in early spring condition. Not busy at all due to windy conditions probably. Great location. Three great nine hole courses.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The lakes is without a doubt, my favorite nine of the Three at Ironwood. In general, the courses is well-maintained, fun to play and fairly reasonable price."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Even thought the course is on the shorter side, the layout makes you play various irons and woods off the tee which is a nice change once in a while. Tips tees were not set out so played the blue tees but was still a very enjoyable time."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"9th hole on the ridge green was under repair and they moved the green to the fairway. When you grabbed your ball from the fairway green in this hole it was covered in water that smelled like sewage. Mowers mowed from 1-18 instead of in reverse so you would have mowers following you, very closely, for several holes. Mowers would not stop mowing during tee-offs. Odd behavior when course charges 60 dollars for 18."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Great course and overall round. Only complaint is the cart was very slow and struggled to get up some hills with total player weight ~410#
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Course was in good shape and pace of play was moving.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Every hole different enjoyable love the course! Great practice area A+
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,My husband and I played and we were paired up with 2 other young men and we had a great day of 18 holes. Pace of play was awesome and we never waited on people in front of us and we were not pushed from behind!
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Worth the money! Excellent condition I’ll give it a 91/2!! Staff is kind and carts were in good shape!
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"We were planning on 3 of us golfing in our groups, but 1 of us were unable to attend. My son and I were paired with a 3rd person and Tony was delightful. The course was very soggy because of rain, and the sand traps were wet and unraked. But otherwise it was a great time and great golf."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Course was wet from a big storm but handled the water well. Apparently there were 9 4somes in front of us scrambling, and 1/2 of them could barely make contact. Add that to cartpath only and you get a 5 hour round. Made for a brutal day. At one point, we waited 18 minutes for our next shot."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Cart girl tried to get things moving as she was upset with the pace as well but there seemed to be no intervention from staff to increase pace. Pretty ridiculous but overall liked the course
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,The course is in great shape and the social anxiety of playing with two others was quickly resolved when they ran late. The two of us played in 3hours. Tee time was 7:36 and it was totally worth it. Great value. Would definitely play again.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Course is somewhat over played or not respected by most players. Lots of divots on the fairways unfixed. Greens have ball marks everywhere that no one fixes. For the price I feel people should repair ball marks and divots.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"If you want to golf on a beautiful course, then you will love ironwood. Wonderful scenery. We love golfing there!"
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Fun course and well maintained. Great staff and bar selection
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Challenging course lined with beautiful woods and lake views. Loved the par 3s over water. Will be back.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Great course with friendly staff. Grounds crew and greenskeepers do a great job. Some of the pin placements on the Lakes really keep you on your toes. Would recommend and highly encourage playing the Lakes in combination with the Ridge or Valley.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,I enjoy playing the lakes and ridges. The valleys isn’t my favorite. Although I like it no one fixed ball marks on the greens. That’s irritating. I usually make a point to fix my own plus 2/3 more. To better the course.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,The course was not in great shape but I’ll give them a pass due to coming out of a really wet spring. I’ll see in a few weeks how the conditions are for the price.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Many challenging holes. Good signage with yardages clearly marked.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Great course and certainly not as bad as the reviews would have one to believe. Loved it and will be back for 27 Holes
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,This course was amazing and in far better condition than the ratings suggest. The only issue which seems to be consistent everywhere is the lack of respect people have in fixing ball marks on the greens.The fairways were great for this time of year and the greens were constantly quick and rolled nicely.Will definitely be back and highly recommend
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Very modern layout. Lots of hazards, greens were in good shape, and not too difficult to put.I was disappointed in amenities, sand is available on cerain holes which was needed because both in our cart were empty. I don't know if I saw any ball washers.I have to be honest, I was disappointedin the conditions of the course in cetain spots.There should be a fence or barrier between the driving range and the 18th hole, not just a Grove of trees and a cart path. Avoid using yellow balls on 18 if you're a newb."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Great 27 holes of golf with tee boxes for every skill level. Super friendly staff and fun weekday league nights. The Ridge is the easiest 9 and the Valley has a nice layout. The Lakes is the most challenging with a signature 6th hole that hugs a lake making for a difficult tee shot. The greens and fairways are usually in good shape except after long dry or rainy periods. The tee boxes could use some leveling but no complaints anywhere else on the course. I’ve been playing as a regular for about 5 years.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,I moved to fishers in 1997….this course used to look like a country club. Now….conditions are alway pretty bad now. Tee boxes were as long as the first cut. Green rolled smooth but didn’t look the best. I usually only play this course once a summer to see if it’s gotten any better….it hasn’t. If this was a $40 course …wouldn’t feel so bad….not a $60+ course.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Course is very different and unique Some holes are really good, especially the ones over the water.Will definitely play again."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Great fun round. The Valley and the Lakes are both really challenging for someone of my skills. Beautiful course, in good condition for this time and year and the lack of rain and the pace of play was ideal."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,The only negative I have for this course is the requirement that the driving range only use matts. I find this a poor way of warming up and does not help in working on my game.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"greens and tee boxs in rough shape. players here need to learn to fix divots, etc. looks like lots of outings were here...great layout, wish they had staff to work on course!"
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The course was in amazing shape. The fairways and greens were perfect. I really enjoyed the course. The staff in the pro shop was very friendly. I had accidentally booked my tee time a different time than I had thought. Even though they had a fullschedule, the worked to squeeze my group in. Thanks and I will be visiting again!"
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Course played very fair and the fairways and greens were super playable. Bunkers have improved a TON from previous seasons. Would recommend to anyone looking to play a fun track for under $100. Beverage selection in the clubhouse is also the best I have seen at a golf course.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,It had been quite a few years since I had played this course last. Remembered many of the holes but not all of them. Course was in good shape. Pace of play was good even on a father's day we didn't have to wait for very many of our shots through our the round. Layout is good and they have 3 nines so that spreads out play as well. Would definitely recommend this course and will return in the future.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Very impressed with the staff course was in terrific shape greens were quick but perfect! I will return because it was a terrific Camus for your money
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,The perfect weather made this round even better. Nicely groomed course and friendly staff. It was a great day!
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,1st round of the year. For it being March the course was in great shape. Played the Valley and Lakes 9's which are pretty challenging. Nice bar area.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Our tee time was booked for 7:54 am, they had 3 groups all booked at the same time. We were told to get inline and it would speed up. It didn’t. We were a two some behind 3 foursomes took over 2.5 hrs to play 9 holes. We paid for 18 and left after we got to hole 11 and had two groups waiting to tee off."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,If you are looking for a super challenging and rewarding course this is the one for you. Beautiful scenery will be back for sure!
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Played nine holes on the valley course, conditions were great despite heavy rain the days before. Excited to come back and play the other courses here."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,3 different 9 hole layouts make this course different every time
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Played here for 20 years and it has been a decline all the way to the bottom which is right now. No attempt to maintain the ridge, and pathetic, but better effort on valley/lakes. Ridge has 0 playable bunkers, rough is complete crabgrass, greens are average but since no ball marks are repaired you have to fix your putt line. Sad since it is a great layout and a highly played course."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"This has always been a pretty cool course with a challenging layout, but had gone downhill for awhile. Kudos to the current employees for bringing it back up to better than ever! Playing in November I wasn’t expecting much, but was shocked atHow good it was compared to prior years."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Impressed with conditions and speed of greens this late in the year. Can tell a lot of work has been done on the course lately.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Pleasantly surprised with the condition and speed of the greens for this time of year. Has some really challenging holes, but some easier ones. 6 & 7 Lakes may be the best 2 hole stretch in Indiana. Can tell a lot of work has gone into the course in the last couple of years."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,The course was in good condition and it offered an average golfer a good challenge. The greens were in excellent shape. The course staff were very friendly and the experience playing there was well worth the cost. I will be back.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Played the Lakes and the Ridge 9's. Lakes was hard, Ridge more forgiving. Course was in excellent shape, not sure what happened in the past as this was my first time playing here. Will come back again. No opinion on the Valley 9 as I have yet to play it."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Just played this afternoon. Absolutely HORRENDOUS and UNACCEPTABLE conditions... I was a member at this course a few years ago and hadn't the course in awhile. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE save your $40+ (RIPOFF) and go ELSEWHERE! Fairways were 2-3 inches long and entire course looked as if it hadn't been mown in 8-9 days. This place is going to pot. Sad to see but can't say I'm surprised. This just seems to be par for the course for this facility sadly... and, oh yeah, don't plan to practice any chipping before your round because the short game area is COMPLETELY overgrown. And, one more thing, the greens on the course are AWFUL. I'm an avid golfer and I play A LOT of golf. These greens are the slowest I can remember playing EVER. Around a 5 on the stimp meter. JUST PLEASE DO NOT PLAY HERE! I'll never go back again. This facility is a DISGRACE to the city of Fishers."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Played the valley/lakes 9 and the course is in horrible shape. Fairways are patchy at best, mostly mud/dirt. Rough isn't too much better. Even the greens are very patchy and bumpy with some greens having nearly half the surface bereft of grass. Not quite as bad as Heartland Crossing on the other side of town, but close. Ranger did nothing to push along a slow group that was holding up the entire course. Even with a couple holes having some character (like 6 Lakes), $44 to play here, even on a weekend, is a joke with these conditions. Do yourself a favor and don't make the mistake we made if you care about conditions."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Played course friday July 6th, it is so much better than last year. Looks like a lot of work has been done since last summer. Great layout as always. Very challenging course. Played the Valley and Lakes 9."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Played in an outing Tue. Weather was awesome, windy, but great."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"I don't play here in stroke play, only in outings over the last few years. A few themes have emerged from year to year...."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"I like the layout: there are some fun and challenging holes out here, requiring placement tee shots, some narrow approaches and the bunkering is fairly placed. There are a few holes that will definitely challenge your game. The par 3s hold up well. I like the green sizes, elevations, even if a little slow. The staff is always nice, the facilities are fair, clean."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The regular problems are persistent: tee boxes haven't been leveled in a while; the fairways and greens routinely have burned out spots. Bunkers are usually in C-minus conditions. The rough is generally pretty consistent, so actually a plus. The range is a strip of green carpet with scrub grass around it, so only for a few loose swings."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"I think they've got too much in cart paths/asphalt. They definitely are mowing and maintaining too much grass (around tees, unused areas, etc). They have areas of heather on the course, they should definitely consider more. They can stand to have some tree management too, nothing crazy, but to improve a few site lines. They have 27 holes, run a lot of outings, perhaps not surprisingly. I think if they took the 27h budget to just 18h, they could really make the place a solid Indy-area choice."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,I just would like to see them achieve their potential. There are a lot of courses in the area that will be better for comparable money.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Tee boxes had not been mowed. Greens burnt in places and slow. Bumpy greens, bunkers in horrible shape. On top of that 5 hrs plus round"
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,I tried to give them a third chance but this course is just not worth playing and I live in the neighborhood.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"I've played this course for a long time and its sad to see the state its in now. The course is in horrible shape. The bunkers are basically mud/dirt pits. The greens are choppy, and the fairways are usually burnt. This course can/should be one of the better public courses in Indy but it is just too poorly taken care of. I hope it changes, but I've been hoping that for far too long."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,First time I have played Ironwood. Played years ago when it was the old Mudcreek golf course. Holes seemed long although it was hard to tell as the GPS on our cart did not work. Lots of places to get into trouble - water and woods. Course was not very well marked in spots - sometimes it was hard to know where to go next. The cart we had was very old and tired - did not make it through the round. We had to call the clubhouse and they brought us another cart.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Staff is friendly and course was in good condition. Traps are not numerous but were like cement. A fairway was very wet and sloppy. Greens and fairways were in generally excellent condition.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Tee boxes weren't in good condition. Fairways and greens were in good condition.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The course wasn't it good condition, and the round took OVER FIVE AND A HALF HOURS! When it was brought to the attention of the pro shop at the turn, they asked me...""well what do you want me to do?"" The experience was awful. I have played there a few times, but 100% will never return!"
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Ridge Course tee boxes and fairways need grass.Lakes Course was in better shape.Fun courses to play.Staff is friendly and courteous.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Ironwood is a great golf course moderately challenging. However, I had great concern about the brakes on the carts. After trying 2 different carts that had bad brakes, a gal walking by said, ""Oh, none of the carts have any brakes"". So we took one of the carts. With the brakes into full lock, the cart would still travel approximately 25 feet. Quite scary when traveling down a hill. On the basis of that I won't go back."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"I played Ironwood several times 2 years ago, a couple times last year, and now twice this year. Sadly, the course condition has gone downhill significantly this year. At least half the fairways were under repair, or poorly cut, and several greens were diseased or in bad shape otherwise. On top of that, the front desk person was not friendly or helpful. I loved this course 2 years ago but now I am discouraged from using it. I will give it another try this year but only thanks to a groupon deal."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,The staff is awesome! Probably the best in central Indiana. Truly nice guys and gals here. +5/5

The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,I will play again and again.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Andy Hughes
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"This was an excellent round of golf. I was told this course was fun and difficult and it didn't disappoint. Really enjoyed the architecture and layout of this course. Not your typical holes that are bunched together and fairway next to fairway. With that said there lies the difficulty. It's all about course management here, stay in the fairways or just off and you'll be fine. Lots of bordering woods around cart paths and water. I'm a go big or go home and don't lay up often so trying to make big shots out of nothing is risky. That's what makes it fun tho. Overall had a great time, course is in great shape. Don't take yourself to seriously and have fun."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Played the Lakes and Valley courses. It rained and we had to wait out a storm for about an hour but I was surprised how well the course drains. The holes are challenging yet fun. The par 3's will definitely test you skills.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Course was in great shape. Rough was just the right length to want to be in the fairway but still be playable when you were not. Greens were perfect. Lots of recent rains surely helped.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Course in good shape, really like the Lakes course.Gps in the carts was a big help."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The recent rains have everything lush, but the course mowers have done a good job. The rough was thick but not terribly long, so it seemed fair---although one of my balls disappeared.Yardage stripes and in-fairway markers weren't always visible, but my main complaint is about the lazy players who don't fix their marks.Road noise is seldom audible on this very nice course."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Liked the booking thru golfnow but they will automatically pair you up if book online. Did not like that as like to play alone.Thanks, cb"
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Very well cared for and beautiful fairways. Very nice play for the average golfer - not too difficult and not too easy. Flow was excellent for 18 holes and the 'hot deals' price was unbelievable! Will definitely return!
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Nice course. Tee boxes can use some attention. Some of them are really beat up but other than that great course. Love playing it.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Various bunkers, were not playable. Fairways and greens are in nice condition. I would recommend this course."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Greens are extremely slow yet inconsistent. Tee boxes are also in rough condition and many times couldn't find a flat area to hit from.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,The course was in great shape. It is a no=brainer for $25 through GolfNow. We played the Lakes then the Ridge.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Was pretty damp when I played but overall in decent shape. Will play all summer long for the condition and price.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Holes #2, 5, 7 and 9 very tough. Hole #6 as tough a hole as you can play. Course was muddy-but its March-so expected. I was glad to get out an play."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,First green on the Valley 9 had some problems but after that all was well on the greens. Lakes 9 is tough. Had a good time with the Golfnow Hotdeal. I love these prices.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Enjoyed several of the tee box locations, especially the number 6 on The Lakes and number 7 on The Ridge."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,We played the Valley and Lakes courses. The Valley was in very poor condition including large untreated spots on many greens. The fairways were in very poor shape. The Lakes was better but not in the shape that I have seen this course in the past. For $37 it was definitely not worth what we paid to play this course.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"seems like r n Thompson courses all have the same problem, they have fungus on greens and r turning brown and bald spots.can go else where an putt on good greens for same price."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Fairways and greens were in very rough shape on more holes then not. There are a couple of holes that are veryVisually appealing with the use of the pond nearby. There is a lot of nice looking features such as nice stone steps up to tee boxes, but they led to not so well maintained course."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Tough couse, but needs lots of attention and water"
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Ironwood has always been spotty and this time was the worst. Weasther conditions in central Indiana have been great for golf and almost all the courses I have played this year have been in great shape. Ironwood was in very poor shape. The tee boxes were trashed and the fairways were splotchy or burnt or saturated. The greens rolled very well but were splotchy and burnt looking. The staff also putt two groups out in front of us at the turn. Overall bad Ironwood experience.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Able to t off little early and did not have to wait! Played as twosome n finished in 3 hrs. Some areas need to be marked better to find hole, like arrows on cart path. Confusing in some spots which direction to turn!"
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,One of the best values under $50 in Central Indiana.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Pace of play was good. Cart broke down far from the clubhouse and they got another one to us pretty quick. Condition of the course was good and great brauts and corn dog bites.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Too many issues with fairways being patchy, greens needing attention including removal of debris from geese. This course used to be a good value, but not currently."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Now I really enjoy this course typically. However this would not be the case on this particular day. The rough was bordering on obscenely over grown and most of the fairways needed some serious attention to the grass clippings clumped up everywhere. I understand that the rain has made things grow out of control but when you have a course as nice as this one you want to maintain it to the best of your ability. I know I just caught them on a bad day because I've played this course many of times when it looks fantastic. Hope the grounds crew gets caught up and soon.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,liked the course but the rough is a little too rough so thick that you saw area you hit ball but could never find it as long as you stayed in fairway you were safe but once in rough even if you find your ball good luck advancing it very far did like the variety of holes and course layout but they could use some directional hints on direction of next tee on some holes
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The 3 9 hole courses at Ironwood differ GREATLY. The Ridge is a great play and in great condition. The Lakes is average, decently maintained but has the worst par 3 hole I have ever played. The Valley is usually in poor or worse condition."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,When I play Ironwood I generally feel like I am an inconvenience to the staff. The course is often cart path only which means on many holes (especially on the Valley) you are struggling to find and locate balls.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,I only play Ironwood when I can get a discounted rate. There is no value when full price.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"One of the more interesting courses in the Indianapolis area. You must keep your ball in the fairways as most holes have water everywhere. I was told to play the Valley/Lakes which seems like the norm here (only played the Ridge one time in about 8 times booking this course). The Lakes has two of the tougher holes in golf back to back which are sure to make or break your round. The course is in decent shape right now. In order for it to be in better shape, some of the trees would need to be removed to allow more airflow and sunlight to get at the grass on certain holes on the Valley course. I always enjoy playing this course and it's one of my favorites for the challenge."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The rough at Ironwood is longer than I've ever seen it, which added some difficulty to the course. The fairways and greens were all in pretty good shape."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,Paid $13 to play the Lakes and Vallery courses and it was well worth the money. I havent been there in several years but its still as good of an value as I remember.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Staff was very friendly, enjoyed our whole experience!!!"
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The course was in decent shape. However, some of the greens were a little shoddy. Also, there were no ball cleaners at any of the holes. The fairways were in pretty good shape though."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Nice course and very friendly staff, didn't have to wait behind anyone on the course."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"For the money this course was great, I got a Saturday hot deal for $17. The course itself was in pretty good shape. Some of the pin placements were difficult for a Saturday. Overall, I had a good day and enjoyed the round."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,I would play here again for sure. Very nice views also.
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Like most central Indiana courses, there was a lot of evidence of heat/drought damage to the course. Overall however, I thought the course was in OK shape. The layout is challenging and I really enjoyed their signature par 3 hole on the Lakes 9. I would play there again."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Unfortunately the course condition was not at its best (I played 2 of the 9's), however I always enjoy playing here. Staff is very friendly and there are 3 9's to choose from, each with a different level of difficulty."
The Lakes/The Ridge at Ironwood Golf Club,531-the-lakes-the-ridge-at-ironwood-golf-club,"great track...nice layout, fair, but a very difficult scoring course..couple of the holes seem a little trick, but honestly just a tough test of golf...enjoyed the 36 holes we played there"
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Course is in great shape. Bunkers are the only knock, but just don’t hit in them!"
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,The course was in decent condition. The greens had recently been aerated but there were also a lot of ball marks on the greens. The bunkers also all need sand.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,You can tell this superintendent cares about the well being of the facility. Obviously loves what he does. Very good for the long ball hitters.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Very impressed with this course always a challenge. Enjoy every hole great design one of my favorites!
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Golf Course was in good shape. Pace of play was good. Enjoyed it.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Our twosome went off first and had a nice round. The course was in very good condition and we really enjoyed the course layout. We were unfamiliar with the nine holes we were playing and had a bit of difficulty with water and sand hazards. Our bad on that, we should have done a better job researching. Regardless, we had a great time and will be back to play again."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Very beautiful course. Cool layout and did not seem crowded.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,The three different 9 hole courses each bring a different feel and unique challenges. It mixes up the experience each time... don't forget a hot dog at the turn. Best around!
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,I greatly prefer playing the Lakes 9 hole course at Ironwood. It's a nice course overall. I do wish they would have ball washers on some holes. They also didn't have any restroom options while out on the course nor any cold water jugs on a blistering day. I'm glad I brought my own water!
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Great layout, 3 9’s. Scenic. Nice clubhouse and food/beverage options. Highly recommend."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Have played quite a few times over the years. Played the Lake and Ridge courses. I would say the lake course was not in the best of shape on the tee boxes and greens. Some of the tee boxes looked like they had been used like a driving range. The greens had a lot of non repaired divots in them. The ridge course I thought was in good shape overall. Greens and fairways looked good.. Hopefully as the season goes on the Lake course will improve.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Course was in early spring condition. Not busy at all due to windy conditions probably. Great location. Three great nine hole courses.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The lakes is without a doubt, my favorite nine of the Three at Ironwood. In general, the courses is well-maintained, fun to play and fairly reasonable price."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Even thought the course is on the shorter side, the layout makes you play various irons and woods off the tee which is a nice change once in a while. Tips tees were not set out so played the blue tees but was still a very enjoyable time."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"9th hole on the ridge green was under repair and they moved the green to the fairway. When you grabbed your ball from the fairway green in this hole it was covered in water that smelled like sewage. Mowers mowed from 1-18 instead of in reverse so you would have mowers following you, very closely, for several holes. Mowers would not stop mowing during tee-offs. Odd behavior when course charges 60 dollars for 18."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Great course and overall round. Only complaint is the cart was very slow and struggled to get up some hills with total player weight ~410#
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Course was in good shape and pace of play was moving.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Every hole different enjoyable love the course! Great practice area A+
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,My husband and I played and we were paired up with 2 other young men and we had a great day of 18 holes. Pace of play was awesome and we never waited on people in front of us and we were not pushed from behind!
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Worth the money! Excellent condition I’ll give it a 91/2!! Staff is kind and carts were in good shape!
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"We were planning on 3 of us golfing in our groups, but 1 of us were unable to attend. My son and I were paired with a 3rd person and Tony was delightful. The course was very soggy because of rain, and the sand traps were wet and unraked. But otherwise it was a great time and great golf."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Course was wet from a big storm but handled the water well. Apparently there were 9 4somes in front of us scrambling, and 1/2 of them could barely make contact. Add that to cartpath only and you get a 5 hour round. Made for a brutal day. At one point, we waited 18 minutes for our next shot."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Cart girl tried to get things moving as she was upset with the pace as well but there seemed to be no intervention from staff to increase pace. Pretty ridiculous but overall liked the course
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,The course is in great shape and the social anxiety of playing with two others was quickly resolved when they ran late. The two of us played in 3hours. Tee time was 7:36 and it was totally worth it. Great value. Would definitely play again.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Course is somewhat over played or not respected by most players. Lots of divots on the fairways unfixed. Greens have ball marks everywhere that no one fixes. For the price I feel people should repair ball marks and divots.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"If you want to golf on a beautiful course, then you will love ironwood. Wonderful scenery. We love golfing there!"
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Fun course and well maintained. Great staff and bar selection
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Challenging course lined with beautiful woods and lake views. Loved the par 3s over water. Will be back.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Great course with friendly staff. Grounds crew and greenskeepers do a great job. Some of the pin placements on the Lakes really keep you on your toes. Would recommend and highly encourage playing the Lakes in combination with the Ridge or Valley.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,I enjoy playing the lakes and ridges. The valleys isn’t my favorite. Although I like it no one fixed ball marks on the greens. That’s irritating. I usually make a point to fix my own plus 2/3 more. To better the course.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,The course was not in great shape but I’ll give them a pass due to coming out of a really wet spring. I’ll see in a few weeks how the conditions are for the price.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Many challenging holes. Good signage with yardages clearly marked.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Great course and certainly not as bad as the reviews would have one to believe. Loved it and will be back for 27 Holes
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,This course was amazing and in far better condition than the ratings suggest. The only issue which seems to be consistent everywhere is the lack of respect people have in fixing ball marks on the greens.The fairways were great for this time of year and the greens were constantly quick and rolled nicely.Will definitely be back and highly recommend
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Very modern layout. Lots of hazards, greens were in good shape, and not too difficult to put.I was disappointed in amenities, sand is available on cerain holes which was needed because both in our cart were empty. I don't know if I saw any ball washers.I have to be honest, I was disappointedin the conditions of the course in cetain spots.There should be a fence or barrier between the driving range and the 18th hole, not just a Grove of trees and a cart path. Avoid using yellow balls on 18 if you're a newb."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Great 27 holes of golf with tee boxes for every skill level. Super friendly staff and fun weekday league nights. The Ridge is the easiest 9 and the Valley has a nice layout. The Lakes is the most challenging with a signature 6th hole that hugs a lake making for a difficult tee shot. The greens and fairways are usually in good shape except after long dry or rainy periods. The tee boxes could use some leveling but no complaints anywhere else on the course. I’ve been playing as a regular for about 5 years.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,I moved to fishers in 1997….this course used to look like a country club. Now….conditions are alway pretty bad now. Tee boxes were as long as the first cut. Green rolled smooth but didn’t look the best. I usually only play this course once a summer to see if it’s gotten any better….it hasn’t. If this was a $40 course …wouldn’t feel so bad….not a $60+ course.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Course is very different and unique Some holes are really good, especially the ones over the water.Will definitely play again."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Great fun round. The Valley and the Lakes are both really challenging for someone of my skills. Beautiful course, in good condition for this time and year and the lack of rain and the pace of play was ideal."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,The only negative I have for this course is the requirement that the driving range only use matts. I find this a poor way of warming up and does not help in working on my game.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"greens and tee boxs in rough shape. players here need to learn to fix divots, etc. looks like lots of outings were here...great layout, wish they had staff to work on course!"
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The course was in amazing shape. The fairways and greens were perfect. I really enjoyed the course. The staff in the pro shop was very friendly. I had accidentally booked my tee time a different time than I had thought. Even though they had a fullschedule, the worked to squeeze my group in. Thanks and I will be visiting again!"
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Course played very fair and the fairways and greens were super playable. Bunkers have improved a TON from previous seasons. Would recommend to anyone looking to play a fun track for under $100. Beverage selection in the clubhouse is also the best I have seen at a golf course.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,It had been quite a few years since I had played this course last. Remembered many of the holes but not all of them. Course was in good shape. Pace of play was good even on a father's day we didn't have to wait for very many of our shots through our the round. Layout is good and they have 3 nines so that spreads out play as well. Would definitely recommend this course and will return in the future.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Very impressed with the staff course was in terrific shape greens were quick but perfect! I will return because it was a terrific Camus for your money
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,The perfect weather made this round even better. Nicely groomed course and friendly staff. It was a great day!
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,1st round of the year. For it being March the course was in great shape. Played the Valley and Lakes 9's which are pretty challenging. Nice bar area.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Our tee time was booked for 7:54 am, they had 3 groups all booked at the same time. We were told to get inline and it would speed up. It didn’t. We were a two some behind 3 foursomes took over 2.5 hrs to play 9 holes. We paid for 18 and left after we got to hole 11 and had two groups waiting to tee off."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,If you are looking for a super challenging and rewarding course this is the one for you. Beautiful scenery will be back for sure!
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Played nine holes on the valley course, conditions were great despite heavy rain the days before. Excited to come back and play the other courses here."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,3 different 9 hole layouts make this course different every time
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Played here for 20 years and it has been a decline all the way to the bottom which is right now. No attempt to maintain the ridge, and pathetic, but better effort on valley/lakes. Ridge has 0 playable bunkers, rough is complete crabgrass, greens are average but since no ball marks are repaired you have to fix your putt line. Sad since it is a great layout and a highly played course."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"This has always been a pretty cool course with a challenging layout, but had gone downhill for awhile. Kudos to the current employees for bringing it back up to better than ever! Playing in November I wasn’t expecting much, but was shocked atHow good it was compared to prior years."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Impressed with conditions and speed of greens this late in the year. Can tell a lot of work has been done on the course lately.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Pleasantly surprised with the condition and speed of the greens for this time of year. Has some really challenging holes, but some easier ones. 6 & 7 Lakes may be the best 2 hole stretch in Indiana. Can tell a lot of work has gone into the course in the last couple of years."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,The course was in good condition and it offered an average golfer a good challenge. The greens were in excellent shape. The course staff were very friendly and the experience playing there was well worth the cost. I will be back.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Played the Lakes and the Ridge 9's. Lakes was hard, Ridge more forgiving. Course was in excellent shape, not sure what happened in the past as this was my first time playing here. Will come back again. No opinion on the Valley 9 as I have yet to play it."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Just played this afternoon. Absolutely HORRENDOUS and UNACCEPTABLE conditions... I was a member at this course a few years ago and hadn't the course in awhile. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE save your $40+ (RIPOFF) and go ELSEWHERE! Fairways were 2-3 inches long and entire course looked as if it hadn't been mown in 8-9 days. This place is going to pot. Sad to see but can't say I'm surprised. This just seems to be par for the course for this facility sadly... and, oh yeah, don't plan to practice any chipping before your round because the short game area is COMPLETELY overgrown. And, one more thing, the greens on the course are AWFUL. I'm an avid golfer and I play A LOT of golf. These greens are the slowest I can remember playing EVER. Around a 5 on the stimp meter. JUST PLEASE DO NOT PLAY HERE! I'll never go back again. This facility is a DISGRACE to the city of Fishers."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Played the valley/lakes 9 and the course is in horrible shape. Fairways are patchy at best, mostly mud/dirt. Rough isn't too much better. Even the greens are very patchy and bumpy with some greens having nearly half the surface bereft of grass. Not quite as bad as Heartland Crossing on the other side of town, but close. Ranger did nothing to push along a slow group that was holding up the entire course. Even with a couple holes having some character (like 6 Lakes), $44 to play here, even on a weekend, is a joke with these conditions. Do yourself a favor and don't make the mistake we made if you care about conditions."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Played course friday July 6th, it is so much better than last year. Looks like a lot of work has been done since last summer. Great layout as always. Very challenging course. Played the Valley and Lakes 9."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Played in an outing Tue. Weather was awesome, windy, but great."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"I don't play here in stroke play, only in outings over the last few years. A few themes have emerged from year to year...."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"I like the layout: there are some fun and challenging holes out here, requiring placement tee shots, some narrow approaches and the bunkering is fairly placed. There are a few holes that will definitely challenge your game. The par 3s hold up well. I like the green sizes, elevations, even if a little slow. The staff is always nice, the facilities are fair, clean."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The regular problems are persistent: tee boxes haven't been leveled in a while; the fairways and greens routinely have burned out spots. Bunkers are usually in C-minus conditions. The rough is generally pretty consistent, so actually a plus. The range is a strip of green carpet with scrub grass around it, so only for a few loose swings."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"I think they've got too much in cart paths/asphalt. They definitely are mowing and maintaining too much grass (around tees, unused areas, etc). They have areas of heather on the course, they should definitely consider more. They can stand to have some tree management too, nothing crazy, but to improve a few site lines. They have 27 holes, run a lot of outings, perhaps not surprisingly. I think if they took the 27h budget to just 18h, they could really make the place a solid Indy-area choice."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,I just would like to see them achieve their potential. There are a lot of courses in the area that will be better for comparable money.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Tee boxes had not been mowed. Greens burnt in places and slow. Bumpy greens, bunkers in horrible shape. On top of that 5 hrs plus round"
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,I tried to give them a third chance but this course is just not worth playing and I live in the neighborhood.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"I've played this course for a long time and its sad to see the state its in now. The course is in horrible shape. The bunkers are basically mud/dirt pits. The greens are choppy, and the fairways are usually burnt. This course can/should be one of the better public courses in Indy but it is just too poorly taken care of. I hope it changes, but I've been hoping that for far too long."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,First time I have played Ironwood. Played years ago when it was the old Mudcreek golf course. Holes seemed long although it was hard to tell as the GPS on our cart did not work. Lots of places to get into trouble - water and woods. Course was not very well marked in spots - sometimes it was hard to know where to go next. The cart we had was very old and tired - did not make it through the round. We had to call the clubhouse and they brought us another cart.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Staff is friendly and course was in good condition. Traps are not numerous but were like cement. A fairway was very wet and sloppy. Greens and fairways were in generally excellent condition.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Tee boxes weren't in good condition. Fairways and greens were in good condition.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The course wasn't it good condition, and the round took OVER FIVE AND A HALF HOURS! When it was brought to the attention of the pro shop at the turn, they asked me...""well what do you want me to do?"" The experience was awful. I have played there a few times, but 100% will never return!"
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Ridge Course tee boxes and fairways need grass.Lakes Course was in better shape.Fun courses to play.Staff is friendly and courteous.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Ironwood is a great golf course moderately challenging. However, I had great concern about the brakes on the carts. After trying 2 different carts that had bad brakes, a gal walking by said, ""Oh, none of the carts have any brakes"". So we took one of the carts. With the brakes into full lock, the cart would still travel approximately 25 feet. Quite scary when traveling down a hill. On the basis of that I won't go back."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"I played Ironwood several times 2 years ago, a couple times last year, and now twice this year. Sadly, the course condition has gone downhill significantly this year. At least half the fairways were under repair, or poorly cut, and several greens were diseased or in bad shape otherwise. On top of that, the front desk person was not friendly or helpful. I loved this course 2 years ago but now I am discouraged from using it. I will give it another try this year but only thanks to a groupon deal."

The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"This was an excellent round of golf. I was told this course was fun and difficult and it didn't disappoint. Really enjoyed the architecture and layout of this course. Not your typical holes that are bunched together and fairway next to fairway. With that said there lies the difficulty. It's all about course management here, stay in the fairways or just off and you'll be fine. Lots of bordering woods around cart paths and water. I'm a go big or go home and don't lay up often so trying to make big shots out of nothing is risky. That's what makes it fun tho. Overall had a great time, course is in great shape. Don't take yourself to seriously and have fun."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Played the Lakes and Valley courses. It rained and we had to wait out a storm for about an hour but I was surprised how well the course drains. The holes are challenging yet fun. The par 3's will definitely test you skills.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Course was in great shape. Rough was just the right length to want to be in the fairway but still be playable when you were not. Greens were perfect. Lots of recent rains surely helped.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Course in good shape, really like the Lakes course.Gps in the carts was a big help."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The recent rains have everything lush, but the course mowers have done a good job. The rough was thick but not terribly long, so it seemed fair---although one of my balls disappeared.Yardage stripes and in-fairway markers weren't always visible, but my main complaint is about the lazy players who don't fix their marks.Road noise is seldom audible on this very nice course."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Liked the booking thru golfnow but they will automatically pair you up if book online. Did not like that as like to play alone.Thanks, cb"
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Very well cared for and beautiful fairways. Very nice play for the average golfer - not too difficult and not too easy. Flow was excellent for 18 holes and the 'hot deals' price was unbelievable! Will definitely return!
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Nice course. Tee boxes can use some attention. Some of them are really beat up but other than that great course. Love playing it.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Various bunkers, were not playable. Fairways and greens are in nice condition. I would recommend this course."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Greens are extremely slow yet inconsistent. Tee boxes are also in rough condition and many times couldn't find a flat area to hit from.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,The course was in great shape. It is a no=brainer for $25 through GolfNow. We played the Lakes then the Ridge.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Was pretty damp when I played but overall in decent shape. Will play all summer long for the condition and price.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Holes #2, 5, 7 and 9 very tough. Hole #6 as tough a hole as you can play. Course was muddy-but its March-so expected. I was glad to get out an play."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,First green on the Valley 9 had some problems but after that all was well on the greens. Lakes 9 is tough. Had a good time with the Golfnow Hotdeal. I love these prices.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Enjoyed several of the tee box locations, especially the number 6 on The Lakes and number 7 on The Ridge."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,We played the Valley and Lakes courses. The Valley was in very poor condition including large untreated spots on many greens. The fairways were in very poor shape. The Lakes was better but not in the shape that I have seen this course in the past. For $37 it was definitely not worth what we paid to play this course.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"seems like r n Thompson courses all have the same problem, they have fungus on greens and r turning brown and bald spots.can go else where an putt on good greens for same price."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Fairways and greens were in very rough shape on more holes then not. There are a couple of holes that are veryVisually appealing with the use of the pond nearby. There is a lot of nice looking features such as nice stone steps up to tee boxes, but they led to not so well maintained course."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Tough couse, but needs lots of attention and water"
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Ironwood has always been spotty and this time was the worst. Weasther conditions in central Indiana have been great for golf and almost all the courses I have played this year have been in great shape. Ironwood was in very poor shape. The tee boxes were trashed and the fairways were splotchy or burnt or saturated. The greens rolled very well but were splotchy and burnt looking. The staff also putt two groups out in front of us at the turn. Overall bad Ironwood experience.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Able to t off little early and did not have to wait! Played as twosome n finished in 3 hrs. Some areas need to be marked better to find hole, like arrows on cart path. Confusing in some spots which direction to turn!"
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,One of the best values under $50 in Central Indiana.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Pace of play was good. Cart broke down far from the clubhouse and they got another one to us pretty quick. Condition of the course was good and great brauts and corn dog bites.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Too many issues with fairways being patchy, greens needing attention including removal of debris from geese. This course used to be a good value, but not currently."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Now I really enjoy this course typically. However this would not be the case on this particular day. The rough was bordering on obscenely over grown and most of the fairways needed some serious attention to the grass clippings clumped up everywhere. I understand that the rain has made things grow out of control but when you have a course as nice as this one you want to maintain it to the best of your ability. I know I just caught them on a bad day because I've played this course many of times when it looks fantastic. Hope the grounds crew gets caught up and soon.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,liked the course but the rough is a little too rough so thick that you saw area you hit ball but could never find it as long as you stayed in fairway you were safe but once in rough even if you find your ball good luck advancing it very far did like the variety of holes and course layout but they could use some directional hints on direction of next tee on some holes
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The 3 9 hole courses at Ironwood differ GREATLY. The Ridge is a great play and in great condition. The Lakes is average, decently maintained but has the worst par 3 hole I have ever played. The Valley is usually in poor or worse condition."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,When I play Ironwood I generally feel like I am an inconvenience to the staff. The course is often cart path only which means on many holes (especially on the Valley) you are struggling to find and locate balls.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,I only play Ironwood when I can get a discounted rate. There is no value when full price.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"One of the more interesting courses in the Indianapolis area. You must keep your ball in the fairways as most holes have water everywhere. I was told to play the Valley/Lakes which seems like the norm here (only played the Ridge one time in about 8 times booking this course). The Lakes has two of the tougher holes in golf back to back which are sure to make or break your round. The course is in decent shape right now. In order for it to be in better shape, some of the trees would need to be removed to allow more airflow and sunlight to get at the grass on certain holes on the Valley course. I always enjoy playing this course and it's one of my favorites for the challenge."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The rough at Ironwood is longer than I've ever seen it, which added some difficulty to the course. The fairways and greens were all in pretty good shape."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,Paid $13 to play the Lakes and Vallery courses and it was well worth the money. I havent been there in several years but its still as good of an value as I remember.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Staff was very friendly, enjoyed our whole experience!!!"
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The course was in decent shape. However, some of the greens were a little shoddy. Also, there were no ball cleaners at any of the holes. The fairways were in pretty good shape though."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Nice course and very friendly staff, didn't have to wait behind anyone on the course."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"For the money this course was great, I got a Saturday hot deal for $17. The course itself was in pretty good shape. Some of the pin placements were difficult for a Saturday. Overall, I had a good day and enjoyed the round."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,I would play here again for sure. Very nice views also.
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Like most central Indiana courses, there was a lot of evidence of heat/drought damage to the course. Overall however, I thought the course was in OK shape. The layout is challenging and I really enjoyed their signature par 3 hole on the Lakes 9. I would play there again."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Unfortunately the course condition was not at its best (I played 2 of the 9's), however I always enjoy playing here. Staff is very friendly and there are 3 9's to choose from, each with a different level of difficulty."
The Valley/The Lakes at Ironwood Golf Club,530-the-valley-the-lakes-at-ironwood-golf-club,"great track...nice layout, fair, but a very difficult scoring course..couple of the holes seem a little trick, but honestly just a tough test of golf...enjoyed the 36 holes we played there"
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Course is in great shape. Bunkers are the only knock, but just don’t hit in them!"
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,The course was in decent condition. The greens had recently been aerated but there were also a lot of ball marks on the greens. The bunkers also all need sand.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,You can tell this superintendent cares about the well being of the facility. Obviously loves what he does. Very good for the long ball hitters.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Very impressed with this course always a challenge. Enjoy every hole great design one of my favorites!
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Golf Course was in good shape. Pace of play was good. Enjoyed it.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Our twosome went off first and had a nice round. The course was in very good condition and we really enjoyed the course layout. We were unfamiliar with the nine holes we were playing and had a bit of difficulty with water and sand hazards. Our bad on that, we should have done a better job researching. Regardless, we had a great time and will be back to play again."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Very beautiful course. Cool layout and did not seem crowded.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,The three different 9 hole courses each bring a different feel and unique challenges. It mixes up the experience each time... don't forget a hot dog at the turn. Best around!
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,I greatly prefer playing the Lakes 9 hole course at Ironwood. It's a nice course overall. I do wish they would have ball washers on some holes. They also didn't have any restroom options while out on the course nor any cold water jugs on a blistering day. I'm glad I brought my own water!
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Great layout, 3 9’s. Scenic. Nice clubhouse and food/beverage options. Highly recommend."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Have played quite a few times over the years. Played the Lake and Ridge courses. I would say the lake course was not in the best of shape on the tee boxes and greens. Some of the tee boxes looked like they had been used like a driving range. The greens had a lot of non repaired divots in them. The ridge course I thought was in good shape overall. Greens and fairways looked good.. Hopefully as the season goes on the Lake course will improve.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Course was in early spring condition. Not busy at all due to windy conditions probably. Great location. Three great nine hole courses.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The lakes is without a doubt, my favorite nine of the Three at Ironwood. In general, the courses is well-maintained, fun to play and fairly reasonable price."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Even thought the course is on the shorter side, the layout makes you play various irons and woods off the tee which is a nice change once in a while. Tips tees were not set out so played the blue tees but was still a very enjoyable time."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"9th hole on the ridge green was under repair and they moved the green to the fairway. When you grabbed your ball from the fairway green in this hole it was covered in water that smelled like sewage. Mowers mowed from 1-18 instead of in reverse so you would have mowers following you, very closely, for several holes. Mowers would not stop mowing during tee-offs. Odd behavior when course charges 60 dollars for 18."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Great course and overall round. Only complaint is the cart was very slow and struggled to get up some hills with total player weight ~410#
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Course was in good shape and pace of play was moving.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Every hole different enjoyable love the course! Great practice area A+
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,My husband and I played and we were paired up with 2 other young men and we had a great day of 18 holes. Pace of play was awesome and we never waited on people in front of us and we were not pushed from behind!
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Worth the money! Excellent condition I’ll give it a 91/2!! Staff is kind and carts were in good shape!
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"We were planning on 3 of us golfing in our groups, but 1 of us were unable to attend. My son and I were paired with a 3rd person and Tony was delightful. The course was very soggy because of rain, and the sand traps were wet and unraked. But otherwise it was a great time and great golf."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Course was wet from a big storm but handled the water well. Apparently there were 9 4somes in front of us scrambling, and 1/2 of them could barely make contact. Add that to cartpath only and you get a 5 hour round. Made for a brutal day. At one point, we waited 18 minutes for our next shot."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Cart girl tried to get things moving as she was upset with the pace as well but there seemed to be no intervention from staff to increase pace. Pretty ridiculous but overall liked the course
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,The course is in great shape and the social anxiety of playing with two others was quickly resolved when they ran late. The two of us played in 3hours. Tee time was 7:36 and it was totally worth it. Great value. Would definitely play again.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Course is somewhat over played or not respected by most players. Lots of divots on the fairways unfixed. Greens have ball marks everywhere that no one fixes. For the price I feel people should repair ball marks and divots.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"If you want to golf on a beautiful course, then you will love ironwood. Wonderful scenery. We love golfing there!"
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Fun course and well maintained. Great staff and bar selection
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Challenging course lined with beautiful woods and lake views. Loved the par 3s over water. Will be back.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Great course with friendly staff. Grounds crew and greenskeepers do a great job. Some of the pin placements on the Lakes really keep you on your toes. Would recommend and highly encourage playing the Lakes in combination with the Ridge or Valley.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,I enjoy playing the lakes and ridges. The valleys isn’t my favorite. Although I like it no one fixed ball marks on the greens. That’s irritating. I usually make a point to fix my own plus 2/3 more. To better the course.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,The course was not in great shape but I’ll give them a pass due to coming out of a really wet spring. I’ll see in a few weeks how the conditions are for the price.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Many challenging holes. Good signage with yardages clearly marked.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Great course and certainly not as bad as the reviews would have one to believe. Loved it and will be back for 27 Holes
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,This course was amazing and in far better condition than the ratings suggest. The only issue which seems to be consistent everywhere is the lack of respect people have in fixing ball marks on the greens.The fairways were great for this time of year and the greens were constantly quick and rolled nicely.Will definitely be back and highly recommend
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Very modern layout. Lots of hazards, greens were in good shape, and not too difficult to put.I was disappointed in amenities, sand is available on cerain holes which was needed because both in our cart were empty. I don't know if I saw any ball washers.I have to be honest, I was disappointedin the conditions of the course in cetain spots.There should be a fence or barrier between the driving range and the 18th hole, not just a Grove of trees and a cart path. Avoid using yellow balls on 18 if you're a newb."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Great 27 holes of golf with tee boxes for every skill level. Super friendly staff and fun weekday league nights. The Ridge is the easiest 9 and the Valley has a nice layout. The Lakes is the most challenging with a signature 6th hole that hugs a lake making for a difficult tee shot. The greens and fairways are usually in good shape except after long dry or rainy periods. The tee boxes could use some leveling but no complaints anywhere else on the course. I’ve been playing as a regular for about 5 years.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,I moved to fishers in 1997….this course used to look like a country club. Now….conditions are alway pretty bad now. Tee boxes were as long as the first cut. Green rolled smooth but didn’t look the best. I usually only play this course once a summer to see if it’s gotten any better….it hasn’t. If this was a $40 course …wouldn’t feel so bad….not a $60+ course.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Course is very different and unique Some holes are really good, especially the ones over the water.Will definitely play again."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Great fun round. The Valley and the Lakes are both really challenging for someone of my skills. Beautiful course, in good condition for this time and year and the lack of rain and the pace of play was ideal."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,The only negative I have for this course is the requirement that the driving range only use matts. I find this a poor way of warming up and does not help in working on my game.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"greens and tee boxs in rough shape. players here need to learn to fix divots, etc. looks like lots of outings were here...great layout, wish they had staff to work on course!"
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The course was in amazing shape. The fairways and greens were perfect. I really enjoyed the course. The staff in the pro shop was very friendly. I had accidentally booked my tee time a different time than I had thought. Even though they had a fullschedule, the worked to squeeze my group in. Thanks and I will be visiting again!"
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Course played very fair and the fairways and greens were super playable. Bunkers have improved a TON from previous seasons. Would recommend to anyone looking to play a fun track for under $100. Beverage selection in the clubhouse is also the best I have seen at a golf course.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,It had been quite a few years since I had played this course last. Remembered many of the holes but not all of them. Course was in good shape. Pace of play was good even on a father's day we didn't have to wait for very many of our shots through our the round. Layout is good and they have 3 nines so that spreads out play as well. Would definitely recommend this course and will return in the future.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Very impressed with the staff course was in terrific shape greens were quick but perfect! I will return because it was a terrific Camus for your money
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,The perfect weather made this round even better. Nicely groomed course and friendly staff. It was a great day!
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,1st round of the year. For it being March the course was in great shape. Played the Valley and Lakes 9's which are pretty challenging. Nice bar area.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Our tee time was booked for 7:54 am, they had 3 groups all booked at the same time. We were told to get inline and it would speed up. It didn’t. We were a two some behind 3 foursomes took over 2.5 hrs to play 9 holes. We paid for 18 and left after we got to hole 11 and had two groups waiting to tee off."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,If you are looking for a super challenging and rewarding course this is the one for you. Beautiful scenery will be back for sure!
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Played nine holes on the valley course, conditions were great despite heavy rain the days before. Excited to come back and play the other courses here."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,3 different 9 hole layouts make this course different every time
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Played here for 20 years and it has been a decline all the way to the bottom which is right now. No attempt to maintain the ridge, and pathetic, but better effort on valley/lakes. Ridge has 0 playable bunkers, rough is complete crabgrass, greens are average but since no ball marks are repaired you have to fix your putt line. Sad since it is a great layout and a highly played course."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"This has always been a pretty cool course with a challenging layout, but had gone downhill for awhile. Kudos to the current employees for bringing it back up to better than ever! Playing in November I wasn’t expecting much, but was shocked atHow good it was compared to prior years."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Impressed with conditions and speed of greens this late in the year. Can tell a lot of work has been done on the course lately.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Pleasantly surprised with the condition and speed of the greens for this time of year. Has some really challenging holes, but some easier ones. 6 & 7 Lakes may be the best 2 hole stretch in Indiana. Can tell a lot of work has gone into the course in the last couple of years."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,The course was in good condition and it offered an average golfer a good challenge. The greens were in excellent shape. The course staff were very friendly and the experience playing there was well worth the cost. I will be back.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Played the Lakes and the Ridge 9's. Lakes was hard, Ridge more forgiving. Course was in excellent shape, not sure what happened in the past as this was my first time playing here. Will come back again. No opinion on the Valley 9 as I have yet to play it."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Just played this afternoon. Absolutely HORRENDOUS and UNACCEPTABLE conditions... I was a member at this course a few years ago and hadn't the course in awhile. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE save your $40+ (RIPOFF) and go ELSEWHERE! Fairways were 2-3 inches long and entire course looked as if it hadn't been mown in 8-9 days. This place is going to pot. Sad to see but can't say I'm surprised. This just seems to be par for the course for this facility sadly... and, oh yeah, don't plan to practice any chipping before your round because the short game area is COMPLETELY overgrown. And, one more thing, the greens on the course are AWFUL. I'm an avid golfer and I play A LOT of golf. These greens are the slowest I can remember playing EVER. Around a 5 on the stimp meter. JUST PLEASE DO NOT PLAY HERE! I'll never go back again. This facility is a DISGRACE to the city of Fishers."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Played the valley/lakes 9 and the course is in horrible shape. Fairways are patchy at best, mostly mud/dirt. Rough isn't too much better. Even the greens are very patchy and bumpy with some greens having nearly half the surface bereft of grass. Not quite as bad as Heartland Crossing on the other side of town, but close. Ranger did nothing to push along a slow group that was holding up the entire course. Even with a couple holes having some character (like 6 Lakes), $44 to play here, even on a weekend, is a joke with these conditions. Do yourself a favor and don't make the mistake we made if you care about conditions."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Played course friday July 6th, it is so much better than last year. Looks like a lot of work has been done since last summer. Great layout as always. Very challenging course. Played the Valley and Lakes 9."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Played in an outing Tue. Weather was awesome, windy, but great."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"I don't play here in stroke play, only in outings over the last few years. A few themes have emerged from year to year...."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"I like the layout: there are some fun and challenging holes out here, requiring placement tee shots, some narrow approaches and the bunkering is fairly placed. There are a few holes that will definitely challenge your game. The par 3s hold up well. I like the green sizes, elevations, even if a little slow. The staff is always nice, the facilities are fair, clean."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The regular problems are persistent: tee boxes haven't been leveled in a while; the fairways and greens routinely have burned out spots. Bunkers are usually in C-minus conditions. The rough is generally pretty consistent, so actually a plus. The range is a strip of green carpet with scrub grass around it, so only for a few loose swings."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"I think they've got too much in cart paths/asphalt. They definitely are mowing and maintaining too much grass (around tees, unused areas, etc). They have areas of heather on the course, they should definitely consider more. They can stand to have some tree management too, nothing crazy, but to improve a few site lines. They have 27 holes, run a lot of outings, perhaps not surprisingly. I think if they took the 27h budget to just 18h, they could really make the place a solid Indy-area choice."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,I just would like to see them achieve their potential. There are a lot of courses in the area that will be better for comparable money.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Tee boxes had not been mowed. Greens burnt in places and slow. Bumpy greens, bunkers in horrible shape. On top of that 5 hrs plus round"
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,I tried to give them a third chance but this course is just not worth playing and I live in the neighborhood.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"I've played this course for a long time and its sad to see the state its in now. The course is in horrible shape. The bunkers are basically mud/dirt pits. The greens are choppy, and the fairways are usually burnt. This course can/should be one of the better public courses in Indy but it is just too poorly taken care of. I hope it changes, but I've been hoping that for far too long."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,First time I have played Ironwood. Played years ago when it was the old Mudcreek golf course. Holes seemed long although it was hard to tell as the GPS on our cart did not work. Lots of places to get into trouble - water and woods. Course was not very well marked in spots - sometimes it was hard to know where to go next. The cart we had was very old and tired - did not make it through the round. We had to call the clubhouse and they brought us another cart.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Staff is friendly and course was in good condition. Traps are not numerous but were like cement. A fairway was very wet and sloppy. Greens and fairways were in generally excellent condition.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Tee boxes weren't in good condition. Fairways and greens were in good condition.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The course wasn't it good condition, and the round took OVER FIVE AND A HALF HOURS! When it was brought to the attention of the pro shop at the turn, they asked me...""well what do you want me to do?"" The experience was awful. I have played there a few times, but 100% will never return!"
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Ridge Course tee boxes and fairways need grass.Lakes Course was in better shape.Fun courses to play.Staff is friendly and courteous.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Ironwood is a great golf course moderately challenging. However, I had great concern about the brakes on the carts. After trying 2 different carts that had bad brakes, a gal walking by said, ""Oh, none of the carts have any brakes"". So we took one of the carts. With the brakes into full lock, the cart would still travel approximately 25 feet. Quite scary when traveling down a hill. On the basis of that I won't go back."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"I played Ironwood several times 2 years ago, a couple times last year, and now twice this year. Sadly, the course condition has gone downhill significantly this year. At least half the fairways were under repair, or poorly cut, and several greens were diseased or in bad shape otherwise. On top of that, the front desk person was not friendly or helpful. I loved this course 2 years ago but now I am discouraged from using it. I will give it another try this year but only thanks to a groupon deal."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,The staff is awesome! Probably the best in central Indiana. Truly nice guys and gals here. +5/5
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Food is good +4/5.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,The course is challenging for me (+18). +4/5
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,The variety of three 9-Hole courses is great!
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,I will play again and again.

The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"This was an excellent round of golf. I was told this course was fun and difficult and it didn't disappoint. Really enjoyed the architecture and layout of this course. Not your typical holes that are bunched together and fairway next to fairway. With that said there lies the difficulty. It's all about course management here, stay in the fairways or just off and you'll be fine. Lots of bordering woods around cart paths and water. I'm a go big or go home and don't lay up often so trying to make big shots out of nothing is risky. That's what makes it fun tho. Overall had a great time, course is in great shape. Don't take yourself to seriously and have fun."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Played the Lakes and Valley courses. It rained and we had to wait out a storm for about an hour but I was surprised how well the course drains. The holes are challenging yet fun. The par 3's will definitely test you skills.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Course was in great shape. Rough was just the right length to want to be in the fairway but still be playable when you were not. Greens were perfect. Lots of recent rains surely helped.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Course in good shape, really like the Lakes course.Gps in the carts was a big help."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The recent rains have everything lush, but the course mowers have done a good job. The rough was thick but not terribly long, so it seemed fair---although one of my balls disappeared.Yardage stripes and in-fairway markers weren't always visible, but my main complaint is about the lazy players who don't fix their marks.Road noise is seldom audible on this very nice course."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Liked the booking thru golfnow but they will automatically pair you up if book online. Did not like that as like to play alone.Thanks, cb"
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Very well cared for and beautiful fairways. Very nice play for the average golfer - not too difficult and not too easy. Flow was excellent for 18 holes and the 'hot deals' price was unbelievable! Will definitely return!
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Nice course. Tee boxes can use some attention. Some of them are really beat up but other than that great course. Love playing it.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Various bunkers, were not playable. Fairways and greens are in nice condition. I would recommend this course."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Greens are extremely slow yet inconsistent. Tee boxes are also in rough condition and many times couldn't find a flat area to hit from.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,The course was in great shape. It is a no=brainer for $25 through GolfNow. We played the Lakes then the Ridge.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Was pretty damp when I played but overall in decent shape. Will play all summer long for the condition and price.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Holes #2, 5, 7 and 9 very tough. Hole #6 as tough a hole as you can play. Course was muddy-but its March-so expected. I was glad to get out an play."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,First green on the Valley 9 had some problems but after that all was well on the greens. Lakes 9 is tough. Had a good time with the Golfnow Hotdeal. I love these prices.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Enjoyed several of the tee box locations, especially the number 6 on The Lakes and number 7 on The Ridge."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,We played the Valley and Lakes courses. The Valley was in very poor condition including large untreated spots on many greens. The fairways were in very poor shape. The Lakes was better but not in the shape that I have seen this course in the past. For $37 it was definitely not worth what we paid to play this course.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"seems like r n Thompson courses all have the same problem, they have fungus on greens and r turning brown and bald spots.can go else where an putt on good greens for same price."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Fairways and greens were in very rough shape on more holes then not. There are a couple of holes that are veryVisually appealing with the use of the pond nearby. There is a lot of nice looking features such as nice stone steps up to tee boxes, but they led to not so well maintained course."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Tough couse, but needs lots of attention and water"
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Ironwood has always been spotty and this time was the worst. Weasther conditions in central Indiana have been great for golf and almost all the courses I have played this year have been in great shape. Ironwood was in very poor shape. The tee boxes were trashed and the fairways were splotchy or burnt or saturated. The greens rolled very well but were splotchy and burnt looking. The staff also putt two groups out in front of us at the turn. Overall bad Ironwood experience.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Able to t off little early and did not have to wait! Played as twosome n finished in 3 hrs. Some areas need to be marked better to find hole, like arrows on cart path. Confusing in some spots which direction to turn!"
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,One of the best values under $50 in Central Indiana.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Pace of play was good. Cart broke down far from the clubhouse and they got another one to us pretty quick. Condition of the course was good and great brauts and corn dog bites.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Too many issues with fairways being patchy, greens needing attention including removal of debris from geese. This course used to be a good value, but not currently."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Now I really enjoy this course typically. However this would not be the case on this particular day. The rough was bordering on obscenely over grown and most of the fairways needed some serious attention to the grass clippings clumped up everywhere. I understand that the rain has made things grow out of control but when you have a course as nice as this one you want to maintain it to the best of your ability. I know I just caught them on a bad day because I've played this course many of times when it looks fantastic. Hope the grounds crew gets caught up and soon.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,liked the course but the rough is a little too rough so thick that you saw area you hit ball but could never find it as long as you stayed in fairway you were safe but once in rough even if you find your ball good luck advancing it very far did like the variety of holes and course layout but they could use some directional hints on direction of next tee on some holes
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The 3 9 hole courses at Ironwood differ GREATLY. The Ridge is a great play and in great condition. The Lakes is average, decently maintained but has the worst par 3 hole I have ever played. The Valley is usually in poor or worse condition."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,When I play Ironwood I generally feel like I am an inconvenience to the staff. The course is often cart path only which means on many holes (especially on the Valley) you are struggling to find and locate balls.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,I only play Ironwood when I can get a discounted rate. There is no value when full price.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"One of the more interesting courses in the Indianapolis area. You must keep your ball in the fairways as most holes have water everywhere. I was told to play the Valley/Lakes which seems like the norm here (only played the Ridge one time in about 8 times booking this course). The Lakes has two of the tougher holes in golf back to back which are sure to make or break your round. The course is in decent shape right now. In order for it to be in better shape, some of the trees would need to be removed to allow more airflow and sunlight to get at the grass on certain holes on the Valley course. I always enjoy playing this course and it's one of my favorites for the challenge."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The rough at Ironwood is longer than I've ever seen it, which added some difficulty to the course. The fairways and greens were all in pretty good shape."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,Paid $13 to play the Lakes and Vallery courses and it was well worth the money. I havent been there in several years but its still as good of an value as I remember.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Staff was very friendly, enjoyed our whole experience!!!"
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"The course was in decent shape. However, some of the greens were a little shoddy. Also, there were no ball cleaners at any of the holes. The fairways were in pretty good shape though."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Nice course and very friendly staff, didn't have to wait behind anyone on the course."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"For the money this course was great, I got a Saturday hot deal for $17. The course itself was in pretty good shape. Some of the pin placements were difficult for a Saturday. Overall, I had a good day and enjoyed the round."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,I would play here again for sure. Very nice views also.
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Like most central Indiana courses, there was a lot of evidence of heat/drought damage to the course. Overall however, I thought the course was in OK shape. The layout is challenging and I really enjoyed their signature par 3 hole on the Lakes 9. I would play there again."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"Unfortunately the course condition was not at its best (I played 2 of the 9's), however I always enjoy playing here. Staff is very friendly and there are 3 9's to choose from, each with a different level of difficulty."
The Ridge/The Valley at Ironwood Golf Club,532-the-ridge-the-valley-at-ironwood-golf-club,"great track...nice layout, fair, but a very difficult scoring course..couple of the holes seem a little trick, but honestly just a tough test of golf...enjoyed the 36 holes we played there"
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,I SUGGEST NO ONE EVER PLAY AT THIS COURSE!
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,OWNER BEWARE OF BAD EMPLOYEES!!!
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"Scheduled two threesomes to play on 04/20/24. Their website even accepted the reservation as two threesomes. (mind you it was 45 degrees and hardly no one was on the course). We arrived checked in and paid the guy behind the counter. He then told us we had to play as a foursome and twosome. They would not let us use two carts per threesome. We explained that we just got done playing 36 a day for the past 6 days as two threesomes on a golf trip and have never heard of such a thing. Also that we were playing a certain game for threesomes, but he said he wouldn’t allow us to do that. We then talked to the manager and he told us that was their rule, take it or leave it. And then the manager had the idiocracy to ask us if we wanted to talk with the Pro next. We were never rude or argumentative to either guy and totally were confused at such a crazy thing for them to do. I have never in my 35 plus years of playing golf have been denied playing as a threesome using two carts per group. So this manager just turned down a guaranteed 348.00 plus beverage and food purchases because of his power trip ego. I hope the owner reads this and gets rid of them both as they certainly are not there to help his business. We left and will never suggest anyone play at this course."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"When I first played West Chase some 25 years ago or so, it was a beautifully maintained course with a terrific set of interesting and unique holes. I've probably played it 8 or 9 times since in those 25 years. Well, the unique layout is still there, but it is not in very good shape. Many fairways were stressed out with either some type of disease or lack of water. A number of the greens were in sketchy shape too, not to mention SLOW. Bunkers were filled with rocks of all types of sizes - one of which certainly left its mark on my sand wedge. Many tee boxes were chewed up. On the positive side, the course staff was friendly and attentive and the greens' fees were at an acceptable rate (but just barely because the course was so rough).I'll probably give West Chase another chance in the future and hope that what I played on the other day was an aberration but right now, I can't recommend it."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"This course does. It make any of the best public courses list for Indiana, but it should. The course has a terrific layout, limited housing on the perimeter of some holes, modern undulating greens and a great hilly back 9."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"We played west chase a while back, and I am just now getting to a review. The course offers a fun layout with a wide variety of holes. The 9th hole is a challenging par 5 with lots of visual appeal. The greens were fast and rolled true. The sand was actually in pretty decent shape. Some dead patches and tall grass in places."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"Course is well worth a go, and I would gladly make the trip out there again."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"First time playing this course and thoroughly enjoyed it. I walked with a push cart and the back nine is a real challenge physically; that is also what makes it so much fun. Lots of elevation change, some trees on certain holes, water, and postage stamp greens."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,A fun challenge.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"West Chase never disappoints. Excluding a few bunkers and water damage (which they appear to be working on or filling in), it was in good shape. The layout is cool with links style on the front and tighter wooded holes on the back. There are some beautiful and memorable holes such as 9 and 16. It’s just challenging enough to make it fun but you can definitely score there. Highy recommended for the price. If you live on the west side of town, no brainer."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"West Chase is a sneaky, but fun course. The front is fairly open while the back is a little tighter with more elevation change. Greens are smaller than a lot of places around town, though not the smallest. All of them though have some slope but do not break as much as they appear, and roll true. Fairways were pretty narrow but the rough wasn't overly thick. There was some spots where water damage would've caused issues in some fairways, and the tee boxes were a little chewed and shaggy. Sand throughout the course was packed down mud and needs updating or removed (as they appear to have begun to do around the course). Even with these detractions it was a visually appealing course."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,They have a good internet deal that includes a 6-pack with the round which is a nice touch if you can find it. Its a little out of the way but definitely worth a play.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"This is one of my favorite courses I have played since moving to Indy. I played about a month ago and the fairways and greens were perfect. Front 9 is wide open while the back 9 has more trees in play. My only complaint is that the last time I played I was the first out on the course, but when I got to the back 9 I was backed up due to lessons being taught to kids. Just would have been nice to know before I paid to play that day."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"I played the first time here and will be the last time. Greens were soooo slow, grass wasn't cut, bunker is just a dirt, no sand whatsoever. Hirroable experiance."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"Course was in really good shape, and I enjoy the layout at West Chase, even after I've played probably 50 times. New management is re-doing all the traps so some are still under construction, but the new ones were in phenomenal shape. Can't wait to see what the course looks like once they are finished!"
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"For the money Great place to golf , good scenery , good layout very nice course. I've played there before and it's one of my favorite courses"
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"Nice good ol golf course, long par 4s. Fun to play. Staff is always a little snobby when I go thou. This isn't crooked stick hahahah good course thou."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"The West Chase fairways and greens were in really good shape. Had it not been for the water in the sand traps I would have rated this course excellent this season. This is a challenging course and if you take advantage of the ""hot deal"" you will enjoy your round even more!"
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"Love the course, about every hole has character , we just picked wrong day, heavy rains"
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"West Chase is a beautiful course that has plenty to offer as far as challenges on the course. There is plenty of sand and a little bit of water to contend with. The two things I would love to see improved is the height of the rough and the signage on the course. When heading to 10 and 14 both it was a bit confusing. There were other times a well placed sign would have been great since the course isn't laid out in a straight forward manner. The rough was also a problem. It was so tall that we lost more than one ball just 6-12"" off of the fairway. If you weren't right on top of it, it was invisible. It may be the intention of the course design but it makes for a very frustrating round if you aren't consistently in the fairway."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,The course layout with narrow fairways and well placed bunkers also punished Mis-hits severely.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"In my opinion, this is a must play course."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"Always enjoy playing at West Chase ... a fun layout that offers challenges and rewards good shots. Cool thing about this course is the difference between the 9's ... mostly links style on the front, more challenging on the back with more trees. Will definitely return!"
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"We enjoy playing this course. It is challenging for everyone. It has now become my favorite course as I got a hole in one on hole #5 which was a par 3, 101 yards for women."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,Great course for all levels of golfer.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,The older staff at the counter was rude/not friendly at all: he said something about not caring for golfnow booked tee times.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"I was amazed at how much better this course looked compared to the last few years!! Fairways and greens were as good as any course around! I wondered why they raised their rates so much, bit once I got on the course and started playing it was easy to see! Fantastic overall with a great layout that gives plenty of challenges."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,Played on a HOT Sunday and the course was in great shape and the water coolers were full and cold. I was playing alone and arrived about 1/2 hour before my time to make sure I wasn't late. They let me go off early and saved me some time.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"Seems like every time I play this course, and I've played it a lot, there is water in the bunkers and the bunkers have no sand, all dirt. Now don't get me wrong I love the course, but sand can't be that expensive! Also, they always seem to be mowing grass when I'm out there. If I was a member I would be going bonkers over the bunkers. Get some sand!"
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,West Chase is a great course! It will test your skills! Magnificent par 5's and challenging par 3's! The front 9 plays like a links course! The back 9 you get trees and incredibly difficult rough! Overall a fantastic course!
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,My brother and I played 18 holes. We booked online thru Golfnow for a hot deal. The course was in really good shape. We would recommend playing here to any of our friends and family.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"this is bay far the best course I ha play, guys this place is beautiful I love it ......"
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"The greens were a bit damaged, probably some winter kill that hadn't healed yet. They were, however, fast and pretty true despite the damage. Fairways were in good shape. The front nine was kind of blah, okay but not particularly memorable. The back had a lot more character, Overall, it was an enjoyable round, and course conditions should improve as we get later in the year. Played in about 3 1/2 hours."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,I've never had any major issues at this course. Greens are nice. Staff could be friendlier.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,Course is scenic and fair. I like that it favors those who can hit the ball left and right. Not overly tough but has a few challenging holes. Fun for all skill levels!
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,The course was a little rough but I think that was due to the amount of rain and being early in the year. Greens are small which was a challenge on a very windy day. The gentleman in the clubhouse was very nice and as were the grounds keepers I interacted with. I think the course could have been marked better for those trying to play for the first time. Was confusing at times trying to get around.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,Course was in great shape. Lots of water and an over water driving range for your entertainment. I strongly recommend practicing in the range bunker to get acquainted with the sand - very fluffy. One significant event I was impressed with...I couldn't find my watch after the round and I asked at the desk - they asked for my cell number just in case. At dinner that night with my group they called and indicated they had my watch - i had assumed I would not see it again. They indicated that someone would be at the clubhouse at 6:30 AM. I was there at 6:20 and the pro who opened the shop led me to recover my missing timepiece. Thanks gentlemen. I will be back.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,Good course for the money! The green were just aerated and sanded heavily. But otherwise a good course.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,New ownership is improving this great layout. A must Play!
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,Never have understood how this course charges what they do. The sand traps are awful. I've played here multiple times because it's close to home and have never seen it in tip top shape
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"Course was great, but we had several people who would not let faster golfers to pass. They claimed to playing a tournament (they may have with 2 other foursomes) we started at 2:30 finished at 7:00.we usually take 3 hours. My golfing partner had to leave after 13 holes, had to make an appointment.Last time we played had a similar problem. I guess if you plan on playing here plan on 5 hours :("
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,The worst experience by far at a course in Indy area. Staff not very friendly and the pace of play was super slow that day.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"But not spectacular. Front 9 plays relatively flat, back has more elevation changes."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"Course is lush and in good shape as are most in tube area due to a cooler, wetter summer than usual. Greens are decent, if a bit slow. Bunkers are an issue, many in poor shape."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,Challenging but fair course for average players. Bunkers still under repair.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"nice course, need bunker work, had been wet...friendly personnel Is getting better since new ownership,"
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"Although it had been raining for days prior and the day of play, the course was in very good condition. Can't wait to play on a dry day! Pricing through Golfnow is good. Great value. Beautiful clubhouse. Will go back often."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"Coarse was in decent shape. no real complains except the sand traps are DIRT TRAPS!! out group of 16 deemed them unplayable and didnt play them,"
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"This was my first time here. 15 mile drive and worth it. Now it was a slow day so that helped. But the course was in good condition, especially the greens."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,Good variety and challenge. Some elevated tees and plays through some nice scenery.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,Due to recent rainfall course was wet but I had expected that. The black tees looked very difficult as were the gold's. I chose the greens which for me were still difficult. No roll on the fairways due to conditions.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,First time player here. I liked the course and the people. No hot food available that day is only reason rated lower.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,My twosome just played 18 holes in just over 5 hours. No starter or ranger to govern speed of play which was very surprising on Memorial Day weekend. Some sandtraps were under repair. Fairways were cut too short. Hit off of dirt in the fairway a few times. There are some nice elevation changes on the back nine but overall it's an average housing edition course. I will not play this course again. There are better options at this price range.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,Paid 15 plus book fee for a 6p tee time. If you hit em straight course is in great condition gets a little unkept on stray shots. The pace was quick but i did not play during peak hours and the elder gentleman at the pro shop was not the most efficient but hospitable. Great value will play again not big on their customer service. Thanks
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,You can't beat a $35 rate for this course. A couple long par 3s that will challenge any player. A creative layout that you must have an accurate tee shot to score at all.Highly recommend to anyone looking for a new course to give them a test.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"New owners have stepped in to keep this course, which has an excellent reputation, up and operating. Clubhouse pro shop gradually being restocked as of early May. Overall course condition is good, sand bunkers overall are in poor shape. Rocks and stones in bunkers, shallow coarse sand in many bunkers, and some bunkers are circled as GUR. Usually there is sand or turf mixture to scoop into divots, but there was no treatment provided on brand-new golf carts. Greens are in excellent shape. Rough needed mowing on Wed. morning we visited, white dandelions concentrated in many locations. Hoping for quick improvement over the course of the spring, but it would appear there's a long way to go in improving the condition of sand bunkers."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,I really enjoy playing here. There are a variety of hole designs to keep things interesting and elevation changes so that some holes play uphill while others play downhill. Even though it is surrounded by homes there are several holes where it feels more private and the houses are far enough from the fairways and greens to keep golfers from feeling too nervous about letting a shot get away from them. Did I mention how well the greens putt? One bit of advice however...keep the approach shot below the hole.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,This course is a nice course in decent condition. Front 9 challenges and back 9 is a little nicer. Overall I had a good round at a nice course. I hope the new management spruces up this course in the near future!
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"GREENS HAD BEEN PLUGGED AND SANDED [POORLY] BUNKERS HAVE NO DRAINS AND SOME FULL OF WATER OTHERS HAD BEEN RAKED BUT NO SAND IN THEM,CONDITION OF RANGE BALLS A JOKE.LAST COMMENT: NICE LAYOUT AND COULD BE NICE COURSE WITH SOME MAINTANCE AND GPS"
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,Scenic view is amazing . Great had sand but still great.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"After playing 1st nine holes, back nine was backed up with foursome, threesome, and twosome. Guy behind counter said that's the way they do it. They start players on back 9 when # 1 is backed up. So if you want play 18 holes without waiting, you might have to wait on back 9. Sand traps are full of water. If your ball goes in, forget it. You can't find it."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,The back nine is worth the wait. Terrain variations provide beautiful and challenging golf.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,Very good course to check my ball hitting technics is correct or not with this hilly course.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"Greens in good shape. Bunkers have drainage problems which made most of them unplayable. Interesting layout and friendly staff make it a nice place, but in need of some TLC."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"The front, except for holes 4 and 9, is unremarkable and scoreable. The back 9 is tough, esp from the back tees. Par 3s (12 and 14) are 230 and 215, into tiny greens, with hazards present. 16 is 480, par 4, into a tiny green. 15 is also a tough par 4 into a tiny green. I had a good rd going thru 10, but the last 8 proved to be an unexpected challenge. Greens were good, rolling around 9.5, mostly smooth, with a few fungus spots. Fairways and tees were shaggy, and a bit sparse. Not a bad deal, for the twilight rate."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,Overall great experience and round of golf. I had my in-laws in town for the weekend and they loved the course. The course was in good condition and the weather was perfect. I scored a few brownie points by taking them to West Chase for sure.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"We played the course on 7/29, the greens were in good condition and overall rolled pretty well. The bunkers were pathertic and playing off the dirt outside them was a better option. The fairways were good and tee boxes in average to poor condition. Overall the course was a good value at $25, but in need of some tlc."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,Staff was very friendly. Course was in great shape. Weather was perfect. Pace was great.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,sand traps need alot of work. the others were all compacted. Greens were in fine shape and putted true
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,Everything but some of the bunkers are in good shape
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,The course was nicely laid out. The staff was very friendly and the course had some challenging hole. We'll worth your money.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"Greens were in very good condition. Challenging course with lots of surprises. Without local knowledge, this course can humble low handicappers. Fun and interesting layout."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"We did not have the environment we thought we were going to have. We went out on Sunday afternoon at 4pm. Thought we'd have a nice quiet round. When we arrived a private party was utilizing the banquet facility. Members of the party were running all over the practice putting green and practice sand traps. Children were screaming at the top of their lungs and crying on the putting green. No staff from the course seemed to notice or ask them to please stop. A group behind us had jeans with a g-string hanging out and a halter top on. She cut in front of us, stole our balls, and then held us up the whole front 9. Once we got to the back away from the banquet facility and the improper group things went well. Sure wish the staff would monitor visitors a little better!"
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,Nice course. Greens are in great shape. I would say it's worth the money...
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"When I played; it was wet and windy, cart path only. I used every club in my bag, I liked it so much I played a second round!"
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"My first time on the course. It was ok The greens are way to fast and not all the holes where marked to indicate which hole I was at, I only aged the front 9 so I'm not sure about the back 9. Not that bad of a course if your a beginner."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"This was my first time playing this course and I can't wait to play it again. The people were extremely friendly, the course was challenging and I had a wonderful time."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,Grabbed a hot deal although it is a course in my groups rotation. it is always fun to play with a good challenge.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,The course has very strong set of par 3's and par 5's! The par 4's are average in length with a few short ones. No two holes are much alike. A nice challenge for any golfer.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,The course is just OK. The greens are only fair......don't roll fast nor as true as they should. Rough is quite ragged. My complaint on this day was the pace of play. It wasn't all that busy and it still took close to 5 hours. No course marshal the times I've played it. Low budget operation perhaps?
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"Course in good shape except 13th fairway was under major rework and all the greens were just aerated, making putting difficult. Otherwise, course is a combination of links and traditional golf and was enjoyable to play. Back nine all traditional and requires placement of shoots to avoid creek, trees and rough."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,Friendly staff. Fun course. Really enjoy the back nine's elevation changes.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,Course has a number of challenging holes. Long par 3's. Front nine is pretty flat. Back none has a lot of elevation change. Great new rates and afternoon discounts.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"Nice lay-out, I like the backside better than the front. Need to cut down tall weeds on #10 creek."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"I love the layout of this course. The greens were in good shape and all the traps were raked and maintained. There is a little different flavor to each of the sides of the course, one more links-like and one more tree-lined. Some of the tees were not in great shape, though, and at least one of the fairways was very poor, probably because it is in a low area along a creek. I plan to play it again next week."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,This course is in SERIOUS need of attention! The greens fees are entirely unreasonable for the condition of this course. Our group expected a lot more and were VERY disappointed! I would recommend to not waste your money and find somewhere else to play in the area.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,I found the course to be in much better shape over the last few years. The course is well laid out and diverse which brings a lot of fun times. The front nine is very different than the back nine as the back nine has a number of elevations to work with. The course is on it's way back from some serious lack of maintenance. It is a fun course and in good shape.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"Great course for the money. Friendly staff hole 13's fairway is rough due to a flood, but overall this course is in my top 5 for the Indy area."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"This was the first time ive played West Chase in 10 years, seems like theyre tryin to get the course back to the way it used to be. But the tee boxes were horrible! all were pretty chewed up and/or needed to be cut. Sand traps were being worked on but very damp. Greens were so-so, mostly from disrespectful players not repairing their ball marks and scuffling their feet. Still a beautiful course with a lot of potential. Wouldnt pay full price for the way the course is now...hot deals or twilight is the way to go"
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,Greens are good but fairways lies are inconsistent. Traps are bad. Lots of weeds in the traps and sand is poor.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,The course was maintained to the best it could have been for the weather that we've had. Very friendly staff a great course for the money.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"Tee'd off at 6:30pm and got through 18 holes in a little over 2 hours. THe course is not in very good shape. Not many people repair divots or ball marks on the greens. It is a fun course to play, but needs alot of attention. Would not pay the rack rate ever. It's not worth $50."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"It was only $15 on golf now so I figured...It looked like the mower they cut the fairways with had one square wheel. I'm not joking, had this wavy gouged pattern. greens needed cut and/or rolled bad. the reason it was $15 bucks was because there was some co-ed league thing going on and was the slowest round of golf I have ever played. It's a shame cuz it looks like it could be very pretty. I wouldn't play it again even it were free."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"As many know, the course suffered in the past couple years. Now, the course has undergone significant improvement and is playing almost like it did six years ago. Even in the past month, I have seen significant improvement. Excellent work and excited for the future of the course. I play here a few times per month but used to play every day when I worked there four years ago."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,San traps need maintenance. Some fairways were not in great shape either. The rest of the course (tee's and greens) were in decent shape.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"Drove the 35-40 minutes to play West Chase today, I used to love that course and they have let it go to waste. The gentleman working the clubhouse was a jerk, there was no water on the course to drink any where, many of the sand traps were in terrible shape some had giant mounds of sand in them where they were replacing sand but had not rake out the 2 foot tall mounds, the rough on the back nine looked like it had not been cut in weeks you had to literally step on your ball to find it and forget hitting out of it, and worst of all, the greens look like they had not been cut in 3+days, like putting through your grandma's 60's shag carpet. Like I said, it is really too bad, it used to be such a great course, I can not recommend it to any once the shape it is currently in."
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,Booked this for me and two friends on the Sunday of the Masters. Was a very good deal for the money. A little wet still from previous rains but well maintained.
West Chase Golf Club,515-west-chase-golf-club,"Great value thanks to golf now and the discounted greens fee and cart price I paid. I played in with two other people that had bought the same deal on golf now, can't beat it."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"Pete Dye must be spinning in his grave. The greens are fine, but the rest of the course is in awful shape. There were bare patches everywhere else: in the fairway, on the tees, in the rough. Some places had more crabgrass than turf grass. Some tees you had a choice of standing on dirt, teeing up on dirt, or both. The course was so dry that a number of my drives kicked up plumes of dust when they landed. The course is very flat except for mounding around the greens and the layout is pretty uninteresting. The only saving grace is that the fees are low, but for a few more dollars you can have a much more fulfilling round elsewhere around Indy."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"I can't say enough good things about the owners and staff. They have gone out of their way on numerous occasions to accommodate and are always friendly. Love the course, love the layout but most importantly the customer service is A+. Thanks! - Forrest"
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"That's the best I can say about this course... it's blah. The holes are boring and mostly repetitive doglegs or straight in the trees. Some greens have slope (especially on the front 9 that Dye designed) but most are small and very slow, bumpy, and grainy/unevenly cut. Fairways and rough are also uneven and patchy, and most tees were messy with weeds, crab grass and bare patches. Dandelions everywhere. Club house has very little in terms of food/drink and supplies. Driving range was not mowed and was like hitting from the rough."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"If you find yourself in their parking lot, before you get out of that car enter ""deer creek golf course"" into your maps app and go to a much better course right down the street. Unless you're a beginner looking to learn on a beat up cheap course this isn't worth your time."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,I purchased 2 gift certificates from Oak Tree golf course. There are no expiration dates or restrictions on them. Management would not honor the gift certificates even though they were valid. Oak Tree golf course has been going downhill since the new owners took over. There are much nicer golf courses in Indiana for money.
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"This a very walkable course, and you will be challenged from all tee boxes. Back tees better be a long hitter and the front tees (Gold) better have a good wedge game.The real challenge is the greens; Side hills fast greens, very subtle breaks that you wont read unless played many times. the only weak area are the sand traps, some are packed very tight others play as no sand at all. Overall you will have a good time and will be challedged."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,Way too expensive for what you get. Drive a couple miles farther to Deer Creek you pay less and have 100x more challenges and scenery. Oak Tree is flat. Good to tune your wedges. Greens are best in city but the staff is awful & the price is way too high. Facilities should want to grow the game. Oak Tree doesn't allow children under eight out. What a joke. Not family friendly.
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,Showed up to play and meet some new golfers. Had a great time playing Oak Tree
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,Enjoyed the round. Meet some new and friendly golfers. Will come out again and play soon. Great staff and course.
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,fairways hadn't been mowed so the fairway was as rough as the rough
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,Oak Tree was in good shape-greens were great and the fairways were good; they were were cut appropriately! Decent course! Go play it!
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"Staff was friendly, other golfers courteous and course in good condition. Fairways look open but ball placement key, greens in good shape and challenging."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"Quit after 11 holes. Back nine was backed up and not moving. If pin placement for remaining holes was anything like front nine, weekend play will take way too long! Estimate that we were on our way to a 5 1/2 to 6 hr round on a short track."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"Go value for your money, courses need a little work . I'll play again, staff was very nice."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,Lots of par 4 and long fairways. Everyone was friendly. Looking forward to going back again.
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"I would definitely play this course again. We were able to get on the course as soon as we arrived. The staff was friendly and accommodating. Other golfers on the course were friendly and respectful. The pace of play was good, but we did have a husband/wife twosome cut in from somewhere on the fourth hole that slowed everything down. They let us through on the seventh and the pace of play from then on was excellent. The greens were fast and in very good condition. A few of the tee boxes were a little rough, but did not detract from the enjoyment of the round. I would recommend this course to any level golfer for an enjoyable round of golf."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,Unfortunately I was unaware of a golf outing that day and we teed off a lot later than our tee time. Our front 9 was excruciating slow but by the time we got to the back 9 the outing was finishing up and we breezed through.
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"I have played on this course several times before over the course of the last 12 years and have to say it's in some of the best condition I've ever seen it. The green were in great shape, the fairways were cut short and were in great shape, the rough was thick and lush, but.....the tee boxes were horrible. They were choppy, over grown, tore up, and really unlevel. Please fix the tee boxes!"
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"Played around noon and started the back nine at 1:15, course very open that afternoon, no wait until back nine and the four some let us play through. We had a great time, value was good with purchase through golfnow. I wouldn't pay there regular prices to play this course, its close by and convenient. Yes I would play again for $20 or less."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,I will never come back to Oaktree to golf. I bought a tee time on golfnow and I showed up with my 5 year old son and they would not let me play because he was not 8. Not only did I feel horrible but my son was stunned because he talked about going golfing with his dad the whole day. We should want kids to get into sports and other activities to stay off the street but I guess that is not what Oaktree golf course wants. I will never go back there and I hope no one else does either.
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"Needs a ranger on the weekends to ensure a proper pace of play. While my wife and I played as a twosome and understood that we would have some time between shots, the course really got backed up on the back nine by an intoxicated foursome a couple of groups in front of us that shouldn't have been allowed to run amuck."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"Designwise, the course was one of Pete Dye's earlier products (sans railroad ties) and had numerous forced carries to greens that often sloped front to back, making it difficult for us to hold a shot. Several of the forward tees were not in good condition and needed to be rebuilt or improved to justify the regular cost of the greens fee. There were no senior rates for weekend play...which didn't make a lot of sense for this ""senior citizen."""
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"The weather was fabulous, however, and any day on a golf course far exceeds any day not on a golf course."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"While I recommend the course to others, I would not likely play this course again unless I could do so for a reduced rate from a golf discounter such as GolfNow.com."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"Staff was very helpful. They offer 10% back rewards so you are basically getting 10% off everything(food, range balls, pro shop, green fees, etc. ) I will be playing again."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,Course in good shape for so early in the year andfollowing the tough winter. Course staff friendlyand accommodating. Played as a two-some.No pressure. Finished 18 holes in 4 hours.Enjoyable time. Will definitely come back again.Staff was complimentary to GolfNow.
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"One really nice benefit was the golf cart cover at no additional charge, very nice. The tee boxes were closed due to the weather. We had an enjoyable round and will be back."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"It's a fun course, the greens are great and undulating. The only draw back, they close their tees in October and don't open them until April"
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"Always love playing Oak Tree. The course is always in great shape, and the staff is very accommadating. It's nice that they have a starter and ranger helping making the overall expierence a great one."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,There was an outing going on. I went with a group of 3 for my friends birthday. While teeing off we were told to hurry up because the group behind us had rented the place out. On their way to the tee the group behind us seemed a little upset they had to wait a couple minutes for us to tee off and asked what was going on and if we were part of the scramble. The staff was friendly and we had fun but felt a little rushed at the start of the day.
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,The course is a challenging course yet fun. When I played the rough needed to be mowed (I was told that the mower was being repaired) plus they have had a lot of rain recently. The greens were in great shape. The tee boxes were a little on the rough side but functional. The front nine is designed by Dye and had some long fairways.
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"I took my wife for her first round ever and felt pushed around by the marshal and the manager. We arrived early and were asked to start ASAP (about 5-10 minutes prior to our scheduled tee time). We did take our time on that hole, but it was my wife's first round. Before we even made it to the green, we were told by the marshal that he ""needed us to move to the back nine as he had 2 foursomes that use the course weekly, and a group of 24 just after them"". I wasn't very understanding with the marshal because of his unfriendly and demanding tone, but my wife tugged my shirt, so we agreed to move. Then on 18, he stops us mid hole to ask if we would be playing the front 9. I was baffled at the question. He complained that we had people coming up on us #they were on the green at 16#. Yes we were slow, but not so much of a worry that he needed to stop our play. He could have waited until we reached the turn, and then could have been cordial. At the turn, I made an attempt to explain my frustrations with the marshals demeanor and was essentially met with a very uncaring and cavalier attitude by the Manager and Course Pro. I attempted to reason with him and was essentially told to go pound sand."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"Will I play here again, yes because it is the closest course to me. My wife states that she now loves the game, but will not play here again. The staff makes this course not beginner friendly if you don't start out playing a fast pace. The marshal is non-existent when you need someone to keep the pace #I have played numerous rounds here where I was behind two foursomes and waiting 10 minutes a hole to tee off, then additional time mid hole#."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"greens are ok, and most fairways are decent, but the tee-boxes on every hole are HORRIBLE. This is NOT a $35 - $40 course."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"The fairways, rough, and tees need some attention; however, that said, the condition of the greens were among the finest I have played all year (Sept). Their speed was at least 10 and were smooth and true. The greens were expertly designed and were a worthy challenge to read."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,There is a very little interesting here to this one. Only a couple of interesting holes here. It is pretty straight forward. If you do not hit the fairway they are lined by trees that will end up costing you a shot to punch out of to avoid trouble. All the par 5's are very reachable in two. It is worth it if you find a good deal.
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"Several long holes on the front nine, back was easier, watch out on the back 2 holes have water that you cant see until you get up to the green. Only bad thing I can say about this course is on 1 & 10 you have to hit over a tree from the tee box, that seemed weird to me."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,Play here often. Good moderate difficulty at a reasonable price.
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,What a beautiful course. Should have played this long ago. All of us was in amazement about how nice this course again. Will definitely play again soon.
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"I played this course 6-16-13 because my dad wanted to play this course for Father's Day. When I went inside to get my cart and pay for my round, I realized I had accidentally booked my tee time for 6-14-13. The First lady I talked to was very nice and explained she has seen numberous people make the wrong team on online websites. So see got the course pro to come over and he was very rude told me there wasn't nothing he could do about it and since it was Sunday he wouldn't give me the rate I found on golfnow.com. So I said that's fine how much will it be and it was 40 a person with senior and military discount. Once on the course it's straight as could be except one dog leg left on the front and one dog leg right on the back. The tee boxes look like kids have been on them digging in the dirt and making mounds. Standing on the tee box is very hit or miss your feet are never even with the ball they are always above or belove them. If I could get on golfnow.com and pay 20 a round a wouldn't do it Iich rather drive the extra distance to play nicer course for the money."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"beautiful course. Front nine was tree lined with undulating greens. Great for 3 putting. Back nine is newer, not as many trees. Greens just as tough. I will go back."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"Been here before front is more difficult than the back. Course looked shabby, however we were warned by the Ranger that there are lawn mower problems at the start of the round. Fairways and green were ok, teeboxes and other areas looked shabby. An interesting aspect of this course is that the front nine is a Pete Dye design. Nice place to go every now and then, as long as the price is right."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"I have played this course on Memorial Day as a tribute to an old friend that lost his battle with cancer. It is typically in average to above average shape. This year it was obvious they had not cut the grass for about a week. We spent more time looking for our balls in the fairway than hitting them. I can understand if you are behind, or had equipment problems, but I would think out of courtesy they would at least tell you so when you checked in. Truly disappointed and considering another course next year."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"Some of the best greens I've played this year. Too bad the rest of the course was in horrible condition. Fairways longer than rough, grass clippings everywhere, tee boxes not mown and some completely bare."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"Tee boxes are horrible (could not drive a tee in the ground with a hammer) Fairways were not cut, ball hard to see in middle of fairway, piles of dead grass in 1st cut"
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"They should not charge full green fees until the course has been properly manicured. The greens are good to excellent, but unmowed fairways and tired hole placements are no doubt the result of the 6 inch above avg. rainfall we've had this Spring. There is every reason to believe this well run course will soon have all their ducks in a row, but for now I'd check before paying top dollar to play. The staff at this course is friendly as are most of the players you will encounter out on the course. An easy to walk, but challenging course that requires some thoughtful play if you want a good score. I recommend it."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,The Groupon price was higher that the standard senior rate at the course.
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"Slow play on a Sunday afternoon is very common.... though this was a lot slower than normal. My biggest complaint was the tee boxes. They were in deplorable condition. Yes, ALL of them! That is unacceptable on any course! The course offers a decent amount of challenges and it's an easy walk or riding course. I've played here many times before, and usually enjoyed my round(s). But, the slow play and the conditions of the tee boxes are not worth paying full price form which I did not pay. Never-the-less, I cannot see myself playing here again without... better tee-boxes. They were worse than the out of bounds areas."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,When we arrived we was greated by a very friendly staff. They asked if our party was all there and let us go right on out to 1st tee. We used hot deals to book ahead of time. For the 2nd time out the course was in really good shape. We will play there again in future.
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,No problems with the course or staff. We waited for the group ahead all day long. They never offered to let us play through and we didn't push the issue.
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,this cousre is good for the average golfer and the back 9 is much more difficult. for the price i would recomend it to anyone.
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"I booked the HOT DEAL ($15 for 18 holes w/ cart) normal price of $36. I live near this course and play it quite often. It is a goodcourse, but if you are looking for a country club type course keep looking. Not real long, about 6000-6300 yards depending on the tees. Nice greens, undulated but fair. Front nine has a couple long par 4's, but back nine plays a few strokes easier. Sand traps are not country club type, but there are not a lot of traps. I would compare it to the city courses, such as South Grove, Sahm, Pleasant Run."
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,Play was so slow and so poorly managed that it was hard to enjoy. On the second hole there were 3 flights of foursomes waiting to tee off (play ahead of the group on the green was stacked up as we could see the other holes too so it wasn't that there was just one slow group out there) Have a starter with a clue. It felt like agony as it took 3 hours to play the front nine and we had to leave after the 10th because we were out of time. The course itself wasn't in that great of shape. I wouldn't play it again for free.
Oaktree Golf Course,5915-oaktree-golf-course,"Fairways need were ok, a little to long. Rough was tall, i lost 3 balls in the long grass. Tee boxes needed some work."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,The course was in excellent shape across the board. Had a frost delay which is understandable. Once the course was playable they started groups on different holes to get the groups out faster.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Conditions are nice, layout is a bit jumbled which causes backups starting on hole 2. even though there is a starter you won't tee off on time. 5-6 hour round bc of this and was told by a member it's normal. Well kept course but doesn't have the x factor or character that draws me back. greens just aerated/sanded but no mention of that after paying full weekend rate."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Is a good course. Front nine is the better side but a bunch of nice holes.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"great layout. playing from silver tees all the holes were reachable. greens are a challenge, no easy putts was a bit frustrating."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"They have improved this course considerably the last couple of years, bunkers have improved but could still use a little more sand. Greens and fairways are in nice condition. Enjoyed playing and will play again."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Course was in excellent condition. All bunkers had soft, white sand. Greens were very smooth and putts rolled true. Five sets of tees made it easy for long-hitters and short hitters to play together. Got around in under four hours."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Friendly staff in the pro shop and in the pub also.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"The greens were in great shape. We had 2 different groups of a two some and a single that came up on us, so we let them play thru."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,A very nice course and facilities. They’ve made major improvements from last year the bunkers are in good shape and so are the fairways and greens. Definitely a nice course to play
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"As my title says, it was a perfect day. Got paired up with another single and a husband and wife. The course was in great condition, greens were fast on some putts. The key to this course is about positioning yourself for the next shot. Keep the ball below the hole or you can have a difficult breaking putt. The tee boxes could use some TLC due to play not bad course conditions. I always try to play this course when I’m in the Indianapolis area"
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"I have played GCI several times over the years. Unfortunately the pace of Play keeps getting worse. This time they allowed 3 walkers on Saturday morning and 1 of the players didn't have clubs so he was borrowing from his playing partner. To top it off, they were beginner golfers. No matter where you were on the course, you could look around and see everyone was waiting. We had to wait on every shot. It's a shame, cause the course is in good shape and they have a nice facility. Management needs to get involved."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Course is in great conditionGrounds crew has done a great job keeping course well groomedVisited from Florida will return for more rounds when in town
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"The courses in really good shape. Was paired up with two other players and Pay play was good. Not sure if it’s because it’s The beginning of the season or what, but it seemed hitting into the greens your ball would release and roll off, but putting the green seemed slow, even going downhill. Not sure if they need to be cut, but that’s my only “negative“ thought of the course. Fairways, tee boxes Are in great shape. I would definitely recommend this course, especially if you can get a GolfNow hot deal."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Great golf facility. Extensive practice areas, solid conditions tee to green (especially for December), and a decent variety of holes. Very flat, tree lined design which offers plenty of room to miss for the majority of the round. Great value at the hot deal price. I’d play here all the time if it wasn’t just over an hour long drive."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Played GCI after seeing a great GolfNow hot deal. Range and practice greens were in great condition. Loved the layout of the golf course and the bunkers were in great shape. Going to make this one of my regular rotations!!
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Some challenging course, fair bit of water but a fun round for sure"
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Start with been 2 years since played hereStaff very helpfulMix up on tee times but got 11 of us outPrice 39$ fairLots of houses surround course, more being builtTees goodFairways very goodGreens very good, fair speedBunkers have had a lot of work doneCart paths have had a lot of work and more in progressWorth playing 4out of 5 stars"
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Electric carts, good pro shop, worth playing at least once."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"I booked this one the night before the round, and I had never played the course before. When I arrived to the course, I could see by the signs that there must be an outing going on, no big deal, those usually shotgun start so I headed into the clubhouse and checked in. The lady said I was good to go, so I got in a cart and sat near the practice tees, waiting to see a starter or ranger but there was no staff around. Eventually I just asked a fellow player and he said 'go for it.' I took off and played the first 3.5 holes in about 15 minutes as a solo player, but then I stacked up behind a bunch of slow 4-somes that were in the outing. That's when a ranger showed up and explained the situation - again, this is what I expected as I arrived to the course, so I said no big deal. And it was supposed to clear up at the turn because the group ahead of me had teed off on #10 at the start of the outing. Unfortunately, I was still stacked up behind players from the outing until the 14th green, presumably because some of them were playing their 19th, 20th and maybe 21st holes of the outing... aka stealing golf holes and playing quite slowly. As for the round itself, the course was in moderately good shape, but the day was VERY windy and I had perfectly good drives get blown off the course and into the surrounding new undeveloped housing lots. Overall a decent day, and I'm glad I played here. Just might not be in a rush to try it again very soon."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Played on Race Day. Found a decent price on GolfNow and booked. Booking was easy. In fairness, I haven’t played this course in over ten years. It was in okay shape, but many bunkers were Uber repair. I hate that there is no mention of that on GolfNow or from the staff when we checked in.Greens/fairways are in decent shape.Some cart path work being done.Staff friendliness needs to be improved (except for Mr. Bartender). Maybe it was a bad day….?I like the course, but not enough to pay the full asking price. Just my preference."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Very fair course but not easy . Good course to test your skills
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Best bang for your buck in the Indy + surrounding area
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Bunkers are almost all under construction, unplayable. They are building houses all around the course so lots of construction traffic and noise plus some areas of the course that are affected by the construction. Several of the water coolers had no water in them or no cups, not a good thing when temps are high."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Hadn’t played the course in 7-8 years and it was in the nice condition I remembered. Greens and fairways were very well maintained. The only downside was that many bunkers were under construction (to improve drainage as I understand). I don’t mind inconveniences like this if the result is a long-term benefit.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Hard greens and fairways. Course hurting for irrigation. Pace of play slowed significantly. Pins in ridiculous positions (balls rolling 8 ft away if dropped by hole)
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,What a great course on a perfect day with my friends and my son playing his first round of golf. Thank you and look forward to the new cart paths and joining soon.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,It was cold and windy. The course played extremely difficult. It is early season so the course has not grown in yet
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Nice course lay-out. The course should be nice in another month or so, as going into late February they were still working on repairing sand traps, tree trimming, new cart path on 11 or 12, I think, etc. The greens were either long or dry, and the latter doesnt make sense because it was cart path only due to recent rains, (it didnt need to be ""cart path only"", I've played on much wetter courses that were not) which led to the slowdown of play and a 5-hour afternoon."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"My biggest problem with this course lies with the driving range, which makes a mess. Practice balls are all over hole #1, #10, and another hole, which I cannot recall. Your car/vehicle is completely unprotected driving in and out from a hit stray ball, and there are plenty. No nets, very little fencing, few, if any natural barriers, nothing to stop balls from going all over the place."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"GCI has become the go-to course on Indy’s northwest side. Well conditioned, excellent layout and challenging. The tees allow you to pick your medicine. Choose wisely."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"It’s a good course but not worth $80 green fee on regular weekend rate. Would only go back for hot deal around 40 or 50, that’s seems more reasonable."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,The bunkers need some work the heavy rains ruined them hopefully they put some time and money into them then I might give it a higher rating. I will play again. Layout is a classic dog track not sure what they can do about that but it was a good round so worth the time to drive up and play it
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Played back too far (don't we all?). Lots of tough pins and angles. Kind of course where you want to attack and be close to greens because a lot easier place to play with wedge vs 6 iron. leaving yourself 40 footers will lead to a long day (think greenskeeper had a bad night). But it is a fun layout, with some really fun holes."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Had a very slow group in front that was playing 9 as we were trying to play 18. Almost did not finish before sun went down since the group that was playing 9 slowed us down.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"First time playing GCI and definitely felt it was worth the discounted hot deal rate I got it at (awesome to see a weekend hot deal for once!). The drive onto the property and the clubhouse felt like I was in the South playing a Georgia or Alabama course. The clubhouse was gorgeous and the pro shop selection was fantastic. The course itself was in decent shape despite the lack of rain we've had again lately. The course is challenging yet very playable for a mid-to-high handicapper like myself. Overall, had a great day out on the course.... my only recommendation would be they need to get better Blood Mary mix. That pre-made tomato juice or whatever they use was not good haha"
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,The amount of tee times they had booked back to back made the experience awful. I understand on a Saturday a twosome isnt the ideal choice and we knew we would have to wait but 4 hours and 45 minutes for 18 holes is ridiculous. We became great friends with the 2 groups behind us because of the backups on every tee box. Nice course awful management
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Course is a beautiful well maintained layout. Facilities and practice areas are really, really nice. The challenge and frustration comes from wanting to play the course but you cannot because of a complete lack of pace of play. It's not that pace of play is slow, it's the fact there is no pace of play. We waited over 10 minutes or more per hole on every hole. They have active course gps installed on every cart so they know how bad the pace is. There were times we had two groups on the tee box, a group in the fairway and a group on the green. On par fives we had four groups at various points along the hole. For the money paid it is unacceptable to not get rangers out on the course to ensure people keep things moving. Very disappointing. Hope they address this issue and get total round times down."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"The Overall course being the first time I've played it was not bad. A good test but definitely scoreable... The Greens were ROCK hard but rolled very true and consistent.Now let's talk about the elephant in the room, The Pace was horrendous !!! It was a 5hr 40 min round that we waited on EVERY shot to hit. The first 2 holes took 56 minutes to play. The 2nd hole had 6 groups on it when we approached after the first hole.I'd like to play it again but won't be anytime soon and definitely not on the weekend when all the Hacks are out."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Tee time scheduled for 8:36 didn’t get out until 9:00 am. Round lasted over 5 hours. Nobody out there to move things along.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Easily one of the top layouts in Central Indiana. Immaculate greens, generous fairways, five sets of tee boxes, great pace of play, outstanding clubhouse staff, driving range and large practice putting green.Ask for PGA professional Brian Robertson...this man will provide any accommodation necessary to make this day of golf one of the best you've ever had.Gabbi and the pro shop will take care of you with loaner clubs, golf ball selection, anything you need. When you're finished playing golf here I promise you'll think you underpaid for what you got as far as value."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,It had been a few years since I had played Golf Club of Indiana. Remembered most of the course while playing. The course conditions were very good. The greens rolled true and fair. Some of the pin placements can make it tough especially when you are on the wrong side of the hole. Fairways and tees were in good shape. Nice driving range and practice area as they also had a chipping only green with bunkers and a good size putting green. Pace of play was great as we did not have to wait to hit anytime during our round. We played on a Sunday morning of Memorial Day weekend.Definitely recommend this course and will playing this course again soon.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Greens were extremely hard and would not hold. That would be acceptable if they were fast as well. They were not. They were very slow. So they wouldn’t hold and were very slow when putting. Very frustrating. Beautiful course, friendly staff, and pace of play was good. Greens just need some attention."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Didn’t rain for 3 days prior and it was cart path only that was the biggest disappointment other than that really good course
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Nice course design. Meandering creek, trees, ponds and bunkers protecting the greens make this course a good challenge. Fairways and greens in good shape for early spring. Definitely a must play in Central Indiana."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"The golf course is in good shape! Greens are very firm, not very receptive but that could be a player problem more than anything. The food in the clubhouse was delicious and very nice staff. There is a ton of construction going on around the course, not on the course, but hat makes for some noisy holes. I will be back."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,The course is overall a nice course. The issue is there is no starter or real ranger. We had a tee time for 9:56 and were greeted by 3 foursomes waiting to tee off at 9:52. It took 90 minutes from our tee time to get through the first hole. If you have 5 plus hours to play great course if not steer clear.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Late in season and the snack bar was fully stocked. The turkey wraps were fresh and awesome!!
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Payed $40 on golf now. Got to the course and we’re charging people $35. Greens were being aerated and we found out on the first hole no one told us. Should have charged $20 and alerted the condition of the greens.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"The golf course was in excellent condition this late in summer season with all greens holding shots like a championship course. Only issue were the pin placements which seemed pretty tough for a11 handicap like me. Short sided, on slants made them hard to make even with a good line."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"I had played this course before but had not played it in several years. I am impressed by the positive changes they have made to the course, practice facilities and the clubhouse. The course course was in great shape, especially the greens. It was a Saturday so pace of play was VERY slow but aside from that it was a very positive experience. I play several times a week and am a member of a private club. If I’m looking to play with friends who aren’t club members I will definitely look in to t times at the Golf Club of Indiana!"
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Was visiting rom Georgia which has much more challenging courses as far as layouts and designs.Course was well maintained and I would recommend.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Greens and fairways are nice to play on and in great condition.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"This course was in no shape to open for the year. They hadn’t touched a bunker or green for months, and expect players to come out and enjoy the course. At least take and bunker and blow the sticks off the greens with a leaf blower???. In addition, there was no ranger and tee times were stacked every few minutes. It was a 6 hour round. Absolutely horrible experience at GCI. I won’t be back this year."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Sunday late morning not mowed Slow play tooDisappointing
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Played on Saturday they had an outing on the course extremely slow no beer cart even though the temperature was in the upper 70s hole in the back nine was being restructured shortened significantly. Played the course because of the hot deal otherwise wouldn’t have been worth the money very flat lay out very little imagination to the course
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Very average course and nothing else to really say about Golf Club of Indiana.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"This is a course that's a perfect example of how to build a natural feeling course in Indiana. There isn't much forced elevation change, but instead hazards placed in areas that make golfers make decisions about their next shot."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,It's a wonderful challenge and a great atmosphere. I only wish it was a bit cheaper so I could play it more often.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,End of season drought has the course pretty hard and we somehow got stuck in the middle of an outing but overall a good course.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,There is some water hazards and a creek that wanders through the fairways making shot planning/club selection very important.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Greens in good shape, and bunkers were raked and playable. Course ground is very hard so if you miss fairway ball will run forever since there’s no rough to stop it. Worth the price you pay and a good backup if premier Indy courses are booked."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Course is in great shape. Greens are beautiful. However, the staff takes your money and doesn’t care about the pace of play. Called the clubhouse on #6 to tell them it was extremely backed up. There were 5 groups on the hole. Their comment was “you can see the course is busy.” Played behind a 5-some all day and a 2-some that hit 2 shots all day long. Waited on every shot and had they cared to put a ranger on the course, it could have been managed. The 5-some was 2 holes behind the group in front of them. For the money, I would expect them to keep groups moving. I doubt I’ll be back."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Hadn’t played the course in years. Pleasantly pleased.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Very good course! The setup is great! Very well maintained
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,We booked a Hot Deal on Golf Now for Sunday morning. We started out behind a threesome but partway through the front nine we ended up behind five players that looked like a family. They were really slow but stopped after nine holes. The back nine was much better. I really like the course.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"This was a great day: weather was fantastic, course was in great conditions, staff was wonderful, I played well, and thoroughly enjoyed the day, however I used one of the last monthly tee time credits to fully pay for my round which GolfNow has decided to stop issuing."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Without warning prior to renewing my subscription as a GolfPass+ member, GolfPass has reduced the monthly promotion to only $10. In a recent call to a Customer Service Rep, he advised that members had requested this. So instead of receiving free round valued from $20 to $62, subscribers would rather save $10. Hard to believe."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"A lot of cargo pants, untucked polos and black golf shoes in this golf crowd. Painfully slow."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Played silver tees today. Greens in great condition. Hazards well placed to keep me accurate and on my distances. Really fun!!
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Course was in great shape. Very good greens. Excellent practice facilities.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Waited on the first tee, and Every single shot after. All twosomes ahead of us, yet it never got going. We could only take nine holes of that and left. They got my money once, but never again. Maybe someone should tell them theres a thing called Ranger."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"The course layout is fairly straight forward and interesting (with some interesting doglegs, a few raised greens, carries over a creek etc.).The greens are what really make this course somewhat challenging because if you have never played the course and don't know the undulations, you can hit a great shot and watch it roll away from the pin.The other interesting course feature is the creek that runs through it. You need to hit a good drive on a few holes to carry the creek on your second shot. The nice thing is that the carts all have GPS systems and give you a good view of the hole and distance to the creek or other hazards."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"A few Par 3s are actually quite long from the forward tees. For example, Hole 3 (longest par 3) was 171 and for most women that would be a driver. Another par 3 required you to hit a 3 or 5 wood (depending on your distance)_"
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Pace of Play was 4 hours and 40 Mins. A bit long for a weekday. The front nine was played in 2 hours which was OK the back really slowed up. There is no starter so I suspect that a group jumped on the back nine. So my 4-Star rating was really due to pace of play since I have played a number of courses (mid-week) in under 4 hours.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Also, if you like to warm up before your game there is a nice driving range, putting green, and a very nice bunker and chipping area too (which you don't see at too many public courses)."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Overall, if I lived in Indiana, near the course, I would be happy to play it all the time. It has enough variety to keep it interesting. I would guess that it can get really ""interesting"" if you play the course on a windy day!"
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Love GCI. I could play it everyday and not get bored. I dig the classic layout and routing. Sneaky challenging course and some of the toughest greens in town. Condition was great considering the time of year and recent weather. It’s always in great shape. Can’t wait for the next time.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"For a busy Saturday, place of play was awesome. The greens are the best i have played in Indianapolis this year by far. Great practice facilities. Staff in the golf shop couldn’t have been more friendly. Awesome value."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Caught a HotDeal for $25...GREAT value. Got stuck in traffic and staff was very accommodating. Course is beautiful and in great shape. Some of the toughest and truest greens in Indiana.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"First let’s start with the course. It’s quite good. Greens are great. Fairly quick and not beat up. Fairways are nice bent grass as are the tee boxes. Now to the staff the guy we checked in with fine no issue. But Caleb, the other kid behind the counter has no business being there with his attitude. He was rude he was unwelcoming and I witnessed this with more than just myself but several other customers that were in the shop as well during a brief weather delay. Overall I recommend the course just stay out of the pro shop."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Played Saturday morning, weather was pretty nice, a little breezy."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"This is a really great course & establishment. With a plantation feel to the clubhouse, solid turfgrass, mature trees and a creek snaking around the course I wish I lived closer because I'd be here a lot."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Surrounded by cornfields, they've crafted a great course here. The place is well grassed, the greens are huge & fast (took me a while to get that speed down) . The tees could stand to be leveled some, but it's not a distraction; the bunkers are in great shape. We got stuck behind a really slow twosome (a 20 minute par 3 wait comes to mind); I think eventually the ranger got them to speed up a little."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"I'd say some local knowledge will help you get around a little better, but I still had a blast. Most holes kinda dog-leg, and there's a few lines off the tee that are risk/reward (over bunkers, etc). With the greens being so big, you need to get your approaches right. The par 3s are a little feast or famine; a couple are long, a couple are short and I like the mix. The par 4s blend longer holes with some scoring holes. The place is flat-out fun."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"The clubhouse has nice porch area and an old-school vibe. They've got a really nice double sided range & practice facility. The carts are upgraded with charging ports & the seats are The Goods! I guess they've recently added an annex building for events, etc."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Great place, I'll be back. You should definitely visit too."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Had I known there was an outing going on I would have considered another course. Great course, just couldn’t enjoy it with the extremely slow pace. The Marshall “Larry” was terrific. He brought us some bottles of water and each of us a sleeve of good balls, hoping to smooth over our wait. He told us they host 60 outings a year.Nice course and facility. Just check to see if there is an outing going on."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,6 hours to play. Staff did not seem to care or offer any remedy. No apology from the course. Frustrating!! FInd another course to play.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"The course has a nice, classic layout. Lots of trouble in the form of sand or water seem to be in play off nearly every tee. The course is in good shape, unless you spray into areas that have the predictable damage from the recent rain where it would not drain. But the fairways and tees are all good. Greens rolled true and all have a little tilt to them. The warm-up area and putting green was a really nice set up as well. Overall it was a good experience and worth a trip."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Have played this course for many years. It is a decent course, not great, but has usually been kept up nicely and was enjoyable to play. While I admit iit is early in the season, I have to say that I was disappointed to find that almost every bunker on the course was bad and we never saw anyone doing any work on any of them. Only saw a couple of persons who were mowing. Also, not sure what is going on on hole #2, looks like they are trying to add some bunkers or waste areas on the left side but all that I see is a large area with zero grass and large rocks making it impossible to play out of??? Looks like they have spent a lot of dollars on the practice facility and the event center, but the course is being neglected."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Very nice golf course to play I will play this golf course again it is in very good shape it is very good layout people are very friendly around you
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"To high priced for this type of course, greens everywhere was in bad shape restrooms were nasty"
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"The course was very nice and quite fun to play. Unfortunately, there were a couple of people that stood out. There were two different groups of two that felt as though they deserved special treatment. The twosome in front of us were playing other fairways more than the ones they were actually playing. The twosome behind us, a father and young son continually hit in on us."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"There is a lot of construction going on at this course. However, the fairways and greens are immaculate! The course plays well if you're long off the tee and have control ariund the greens! Simply great golf!"
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"The course is in very good shape. We were challenged with slow greens. As noted, there is some construction going on throughout the course in spots, it does come into play on a few holes but is manageable. Pace of play was affected by a foursome playing nine holes for the first time this year. The layout is slightly old school with mature trees lining some of the fairways. Water in some hidden spots so make sure you drive up and locate where you want to land the ball. Bunkers were in good shape."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Staff is easy to deal with and was helpful as we needed it. Great practice facility also. We try and play this every other year and each year we have a very good experience.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Booking through GolfNow and paying additional fees over the course fees is absolutely uncalled for. Then to show up and see all kinds of construction taking place near the clubhouse and several different holes.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,No way I play this course for the full price again!
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Great place to play. Green conditions were fantastic, even though some players don't fix their ballmarks. Consider watered rough as improvement, otherwise a very playable track from any tee box. Wide open on Saturday afternoon. 3.25 hr round."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"I am local to this club. Really like that it is close and not crazy expensive and has great layout. I must say thoug, I have never played a course that people don't fix the ball marks or divots as much as this place. It's sad really, great layout, I don't care about the staff, I'm here to play golf. It is at times super slow as well. I think the average rating on here is WAY to high. just 3 stars."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,I have always enjoyed playing this course but the pace of play was so slow that I left after 9 holes. They could really use a starter and ranger to control the course better.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Course doesn't travel much, however it is maintained very well. Bunkers and greens were in very good condition. Carts were equipped with a nice GPS that was helpful for a first time player. Also would be a good course for young kids (course has forward tees)."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Nice course, but I don't it is a 60 dollar course. Over all very good."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,We played this course when they decided to aerate the back 9 during playing hours so there was mud plug all over fairways. Wish the would have done that when closed. Otherwise beautiful challenging course that was very well kept!!
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"First time playing GCOI. Great course and facilities. Holes are challenging, several featuring water and multiple - large bunkers. Greens are in great shape - also very fast and easy to role your putt well past the hole. I would recommend this course to anyone who enjoys golf and hope to play it again soon."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Excellent course in excellent condition. Challenging length or casual stroll depending on tees you choose. Staff is great. The red golf carts with tabletGPS are awesome.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Hadn't been here in several years because of the drive across town that's lengthy....wanted a change of scenario though..... Was better than I remembered. Very good test of golf and solid course condition. Greens are severely sloped and wouldn't allow for lightening pace cut, but could have been a little firmer/faster. Hard to make putts at proper pace because of crowns near the hole. Overall, very GOOD test of golf and very enjoyable track to play."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,I always enjoy the chance to play this course. The course is not difficult if you can execute your shots. I like it because you get to use every club in the bag. The greens are huge which gives you a lot of options depending on where the pin is located. The course was in excellent shape and I would recommend it to anyone.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,The course was packed and never saw a course ranger once. The group behind us hit into us 3 times when we had I where to go. People all over using every 4 letter word in the book. The course seemed to be full of rednecks.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,The course was in good shape. The only problem was there was a foursome ahead of us that was extremely slow. We could have played the round in 45 minutes less. That definitely lessened the enjoyment.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Last played this course 23 years ago while marshalling PGA that John Daly won at Crooked Stick. Grown up since then. I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Quite challenging for 7 index at 6500 yards. Water and bunkers are strategically placed which compensates for very little elevation change. I hit 9 bunkers which is quite unusual for me. Greenside bunkers are large and tend to extend further back along the sides of the greens than appear from the tees. Sand was not perfect but playable.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Awesome course at a great GOLFNOW price.This course is great shape. The course is fun to play and challenging at the same time. Lots of bunkers and water to navigate, but not impossible if your careful. Friendly helpful staff. Beautiful facilities. Overall my favorite for the year so far."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Quality course, facility and staff. Always enjoy the round."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Course is easy to get to off Hwy 65 (exit 130). A little wet in spots, but there's been significant rain recently. Like the practice facilities. Was a busy day but still got 18 completed at reasonable pace."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Excellent driving range area, along with practice greens for putting and chipping. Good mixture of difficult holes and very reasonable holes. The small ponds of water need better taken care of. Attention is lacking by grounds crew. Greens very fair, traps in excellent shape, well taken care of."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,First time we have played here. Course was in excellent shape. A fun course to play. Will be back to play again.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Waited for rain to pass. Course was in excellent condition for playing after rain.Utilized special golfnow rate saving 42%. Making the 40 mile drive a value to play even in poor weather. Staff was very accommodating.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Great course, pretty straight forward but is challenging with plenty of sand, trees, and water. the greens are enormous, better hit it close or you cold easily have an 80 foot putt. New owners have done extensive upgrades to the pro shop, snack bar, including a new wrap around deck with tons of outdoor seating. Also, there is the brand new Cardinal Room for banquets that is spectacular. All and all, a great place to play."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"As I read in a couple of reviews, the greens were firm, but they were fair and perfect for putting. The greens were super quick. The course was in great shape and is a fun one to play!"
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Course was in fantastic shape, greens were amazing. Clearly the course greens keeper is a perfectionist. Kudos.Staff was friendly at every 'turn'.Great Experience. Will definitely be back again and again.Well worth the 40 minute drive."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,I played this course for $33 with a Hot Deal. This is a great Indiana golf course. They had a juniour tournament that afternoon so the course was set up nicely. However the rough was deep and so thick you almost had to stand on the ball to see it. We actually ran over a couple because we didn't see them! The greens were slower than the practice green but rolled truse. Overall a good and fun day on the course.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,The Golf Club of Indiana is a fantastic golf course that has a history of hosting some really strong tournament golf tournaments over the years.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,It is extremely well manicured and has a wonderful practice facility with an even better host staff.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"I have always enjoyed playing this course over the years. My only complaint for the end of May 2014 was that the greens were too hard already. My hope is they can keep them from getting any harder. I hit the ball very high and routinely see my approach shots stick to the green or even roll back toward me a little bit, even from 200 yards out and especially from 150 yards or less,. Yesterday, I hit approach after approach from around 100-125 yards out that hit the green and then rolled about 20-30 feet. My balls remained on the green but were not at all staying as closely as I had hit them."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Other than that, the greens were very smooth, had a great quick pace to them, and had very few ball marks (probably due to the hardness of the greens -I know my marks were pretty shallow when I found one.)"
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"The course was in the best condition I have seen it in during the last 4 years. The greens could have used a little more watering as they were very fast, yet in good shape and very challenging due to their undulations. Unfortunately I found 6 bunkers, and their sand is great to hit out of as it is real sand and predictable compared to a lot of courses in the state which are filled with some dirt and some sand... It was a little windy and that presents a lot of challenges at this course as it is fairly open. The course is very challenging compared to most others.. yet a lot of fun.."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Excellent place to play. The staff really make this course. The greens and fairways were in good condition and play was challenging but at the same time enjoyable even for a novice golfer.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Played the course for the first time and loved the layout. The course was in great shape a we played in under 4 hours with foursomes lined up in front of us. Great pace of play! The greens has recently been top dressed so they were in fair condition, but the course as a whole was in great shape."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Front 9 took close to 3 hours, but besides that everything about this course was fantastic. Must get the focaccia wedge at the turn. Solid deals on miller lite pints as well."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Course looked great! Good value for the money and practice facilities were some of the better I have played. Will definitely play again.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Great condition even in late October. Loved the round and the price of the Hot Deal. Thanks
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Love this course.. greens are very fast -I love that.. If you don't pay attention to every shot - this course will eat your lunch. trouble will come into play very quickly and every shot needs your attention.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"at this time of year,,,,yaa. course in great shape sorry to see summer go. Was a cold day greens a little firm green all over no brown patches,just beautiful !!!"
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,The greens have been sanded and holes poked in them. The bunkers were in poor shape. I know this place is usually in decent condition but right now it is not. Wish I had known would have driven a little further to play The Trophy Club.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"The GPS was not working in the cart, but to be fair I did not say anything. Large bucket of range balls was reasonably priced."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Good coursegreens putt well.All in good condition.Bunkers could use a little more sand in them.gps on carts is nice and pretty accurate.Great practice areas to hone your game.i would reccomend this course and will play againthanks golf now for a great value!!
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,I love golfing in the early fall because the weather is ideal and the courses are in better shape than in mid summer. This course was in great shape and a lot of fun to play.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"The only reason why I didn't give the course 5 stars is because on a busy Saturday morning, they really needed a ranger. One the back 9, we caught up to a group playing as a 5some which caused us to have a 3.5 hour back 9. Yikes. Other than that course and facilities are very pretty with a lot of southern charm. Course was very green, but fairways seemed really hard and every fairway shot we had bounced from the center of the fairway to 10 yards off the fairway. Greens were consistent and readable. It was just a shame about the 5 some, if it weren't for them, it would have been a perfect day."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"The course is amazing, kept in excellent shape and has excellent customer service! What more can you ask for?"
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"I've played this course several times each of the last 10 years or so. It is always in good condition - this year as good as ever. The course is generally flat with water hazards on most of the holes, and a good number of sand traps. At this time of the year, the traps don't have much sand in them. It's better to just play a straight pitch out of them. The greens have a lot of undulation on them. Nice practice facility at the course with driving range, putting green and practice trap."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Too many back and forth holes causes delays waiting oncoming players to get clear. Also tees and greens are so close you have to wait for noise to clear before putting. Pace of play way to slow. Should be a 3 1/2 hour course.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,This course isn't my favorite because of all the side-by-side fairways. Had to wait numerous times because of people coming into my fairway from errant shots. Play was slow! two threesomes in front of our foursome and we were pushing them the whole round.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,The course is s great layout and is kept in great shape. Definitely will play again
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,You are going to be hard-pressed to find this caliber of course for the price ($39.00 - 18 holes + cart). The course is in great shape; especially the greens. The pace of play was the fastest I've experienced on a public course in Indy. GCI has more of a country club feeling than a public course.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,played course right after hard rain.....course drained well and was in great condition.....best twilight deal in town
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"The course is phenomenal, one of my favorites locally, but there were more ball marks than I would have liked on the greens- which are huge! And if you were hitting fairways but missing easy approaches like me, it really drives you crazy and requires some solid up and down play to still have a chance at par."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"This course was in great shape for a novice player like myself. The greens are very large, yet very challenging. We weren't being pushed nor having to wait to hit at any point of the round. Overall great place to play!"
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Being a public course, the usual slow play issue arose. The new management needs to address this or they won't get repeat business. Players on the WRONG tees for their skill level means course back ups. Too bad as the course is is better shape than prior years. Firm but smooth greens, tightly mown fairways, and fair rough. Clubhouse has been spruced up and looks good."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"We played the course as a twosome and finished in less than 3.5 hours. Greens were fast but had a nice roll. Rough was thick enough to be a challenge, but wasn't unruly. Fairways were very nicely maintained. I found quite a few bunkers so I can attest that they were well maintained too, despite a lot of rain over the weekend. We played the ""green"" tees and loved the variety of choices. On more than one hole you could play it safe with a hybrid or ""go for it"" with a driver. Greens are tough (lots of undulations), but not unrealistic. I would play this course again in a heartbeat!"
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"It isn't the fault of the staff that I didn't give this course an excellent review. The course was covered, and I mean covered in un-repaired ball marks and un-filled diviots. It is beautiful, plays long and tough, & I love it. At least four times, my tee shots or seconds landed in a divot that was left un-filled. Be honorable, clean-up after yourself."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Course is in great shape and has plenty of obstacles. We played on a Tuesday and there were a couple leagues going so play was pretty slow. Overall great course though and will be back.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,I have been playing GCI since the late 70's and before all the more modern course built since the 90's. GCI since can stand toe to toe with any course around. I course always looks like they are getting ready for a championship of some kind. GCI is one of the best maintained courses in the state. I play all around central Indiana and I always make sure I visit GCI at least once a year. GCI - Keep doing what you have always done!!!
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,I normally really love this course even when it kicks my butt. On this particular day it was a lot more difficult than normal. The rough was extremely long and over grown due to the volume of rain as of recent. If you did not hit a fairway there was a strong chance that your ball was not going to be found in the deep stuff.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Course was in really good shape and the staff was friendly and pleasant!
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,This course is near the city and freeway but all that seems to get lost the moment you get on the grounds of this great golf course. The GCoI was in great shape after a brutal summer. The greens were terrific. It was the last warm day of fall so the course was crowded but the marshals kep things moving. The fall price through Golf Now was 25% off the regular ....how could you go wrong?
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,I could not move the sliders to rate........
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"I am not sure, but I think I remember we had trouble finding the ball just off the fairway this day and the grass clippings were noticeble where it was cut - I could be wrong - this course is nearly always pristine........"
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,Good layout of course. Set up for long hitters. Greens are challenging but not too fast.
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"Fairways, sandtraps and greens where in very good condition."
Golf Club of Indiana,563-golf-club-of-indiana,"The range was pretty beat up, unless you like to hit off mud, then it was perfect. The rough was certainly rough, but it has been a dry summer. The layout is solid, and the greens were in good shape. If you can get it for a good price, it is always a good track."
Hawthorns Golf & Country Club,5726-hawthorns-golf-country-club,Excellent course. If you ever get the opportunity to play don't pass it up.
White Lick Golf Course,29707-white-lick-golf-course,This is barely a golf course. The greens are barely distinguishable from the rest of the grounds. They charged me an extra $5.25 for a cart.
White Lick Golf Course,29707-white-lick-golf-course,"Staff very friendly, my buddy and I play first thing on Sunday, meeting there for years. Can pay at the end if we want. Fairways can provide a little roll. Greens usually in very good condition. Great value, cart if you need it. A couple of fun holes, one par 5 with a challenging green depending on pin placement. Not a lot of trouble, good place to warm up in the spring."
White Lick Golf Course,29707-white-lick-golf-course,"This course is a great one to start your golf season on, especially when you can catch 18 for $7. The course itself is in rough condition. The fairway grass is a little longer than ideal and can result you actually losing a few tee shots that fall on the fairway but cannot be found. The greens are poor (this may have been due to us playing early in the season) and at beast you are judging distance with absolutely no way to read the lines. Some fun holes but none that are overly challenging. Overall, I would only play this course again if I could once again get a deal of 18 for under $10, especially with better courses with close to equal value deals at this point in the season."
Quail Creek Golf Course,29729-quail-creek-golf-course,Very nice course nice lay out not to hard but you can get in trouble. I drive 40 minutes each way to play it several times a year.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,The greens can get pretty quick but the team placing the pins makes you really challenge approach shots.Like the pro shop area and staff are super friendly.I will be going back for sure.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Like most of the golfers who played this course for years I hate what they have done to this once great course. Due to greed and mismanagement it has been turned into a course that is not very enjoyable. The worst part of the whole deal is that 3 years after the course was reconfigured and new holes added, the place still looks like its under construction, however, almost nothing has been done to address the areas where there are bare spots with nothing but dirt or mud. And it is obvious that current ownership/management has little interest in at least keeping the course in decent shape. We have decided that this visit was our last."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"I’ve seen a lot of reviews about pace of play. We were the third group out and finished 18 fairly quick however we had people behind us throughout the round. Seemed like they were members and stayed on us throughout the first few holes. We let them play through and it was not bad after that. As far as the course goes it was a very fun course although you do have to make sure you pay attention or you can easily go to the wrong hole. (8 and 9 are behind the clubhouse. Course was in pretty good condition however $83 for 18 holes is steep for this course. I saw another review where someone pointed out that you can play bear slide, purgatory, etc for less and both of those courses are in better condition. I will def be back but will look for deals for the next round. Only strange thing I found was no range. Not a deal breaker but for what you pay you should have a range to warm up if you want. Everything else was great."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"A course for all skills sets, a great place to play"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"This is a good course and should not be rated 3 stars. The course is in great condition especially for this late in the season. I played here first time and the greens were good. A little dry so they were fast but flat and taken care of, barely any divots. The tee boxes were great. Carts have GPS. Some fun holes too."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Only complaint is there needs to be more signs for the next hole. It was hard to find some of them as a 1st time player by myself.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"First time playing here and skeptical based on some negative reviews. Staff was super friendly, course was in excellent shape, big flat tee boxes, and overall great experience. Highly recommend"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Pro shop should have told me about aerated greens. Not worth the money at 34.00 $. The creek must go! People skipping holes and cutting in front of me. No organization. Not going back!
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,This is a $30-40 course—the fairways and greens are in terrible shape.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"They need to revise the hole numbers. Cross crossing the road twice in a round is strange. Just change the numbers and have the last few holes end by the clubhouse. The pace of play is slow, partly because it’s hard to tell where to go. The course was in fairly bad shape. The landscaped areas are full of weeds and the steps leading to the tee boxes are falling apart. It’s way overpriced which is typical for Indiana."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"I dont understand how they can charge $80+ for a round. The course is nowhere near worth that. Don't get me wrong though, the course is fine, just not worth anywhere near that much.None of the holes really stand out as very interesting from a design perspective. You can tell they really struggled to squeeze in 18 holes within the land. Its mostly just elevation changes with mostly back/forth par 3s/4s."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,I use to go during twilight hours when there were deals for $30-40. Will not be going back here until they offer rates in that range again. There are far better courses you could go to for $80.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Prairie View, Purgatory, even Plum Creek, as a few examples."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"I am going to give the course a little break here because the night before big storms came through and I don't think they were able to mow the greens (they were very slow). That being said, I was real disappointed in the condition of the greens. There were numerous ball marks on most of the greens which is caused by Players not repairing and no good maintenance practice in place. Also, most of the holes go back and forth so there were a lot of times where other players were in your fairway going the opposite direction. I cannot recommend the course because of the ball marks and the poor layout, if you play there rather than a hat you might consider a helmet."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,No parking 9/10 times you try going so then you have to go to gravel lot which is really just an additional 10 spots. Super expensive $75 for an extremely small course. If they charged closer to $50 a round that would be more justifiable.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"I'm still blown away by the prices they charge. This is a $40-50 per round course at best, probably closer to $40 and yet they are $65-75 for 18 even during weekdays. My wife and I played 9 holes w/cart on a Friday morning and it was $90!!Typical local course with plenty of back and forth holes. The shared green par 4 and par 3 is a cool touch and makes for an interesting look into those holes, but overall the course only has a couple holes that offer any sort of unique layout.You're better off playing Purgatory, Bear Slide, or Plum Creek for the same amount of money.No range, only nets to hit into. Chipping/pitching area is the nicest in the area though."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Played this course 3 years ago and now this week. It was a work in progress 3 years ago and not much is changed. The front nine had 4 holes with cart path only aside from the usual 2 par 3s. Six holes were cart path only. One the back nine, it was 3 holes plus the par 3s. It rained 5 days earlier, so there was no need for restrictions. Maybe the golf super was preserving the course for the member twilight play on Fridays, and the member leagues on Saturday. Who knows? The course is rather boring. Lots of uphill fairways and elevated greens. The creek runs throughout the course layout and has no real layout reasoning in my opinion. Then there are water ponds additionally that are just ""there"". Seems like to make the course challenging the uphill and water make the yardages all play longer. The last time we played it was (and still is) primarily a Pulte housing project around a golf course that was there before the housing project, which is still being constructed. The cart paths are rugged and deteriorating. A number of the bridges have been improved, but several still need work. Players should plan on walking a lot as the cart path is a fair distance from most of the greens. Signs for tee holes still are temporary, although the tee signs are new. A few holes on back nine have new landscaping around the tees. And what were they thinking about placing number 8 and 9 holes on the club side of the road? The two holes are a rugged, unfinished, sloping fairway, run off holes. Of course, it takes you back at the turn to the clubhouse, but for what else. If you play this course, plan on a long round of a lot of sloping hills, elevated greens, and many teeing areas that are uneven and sloping."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,This is close to home so I would consider it my home course. I have golfed there several times and always had a pleasant experience. Elliott in the pro shop is always friendly. Would definitely recommend for a fun and pretty well kept course
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Course in good shapeNo real driving rangeCouse us a great course for beginners
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"This course advertises online booking tee time rates of $70 to $75 on weekends, so you might think this is a great track.I played this course many times back when it was called Hanging Tree, then later Bent Tree."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"This was my first time playing since the developer took out 5 great holes and turned them into short, flat, straight nothing holes, so he could sell overpriced houses. What a disappointment! Tee placements are not well thought out at all. The new greens are extremely firm and in several cases, sparse."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"On one par 5 with a creek crossing the fairway, my playing partner chose, 7 iron, 7 iron, 7 iron and made par. I chose 3 wood, 3 wood, chip, putt for birdie."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"The GPS provided by the course showed that #5, the first of the ""redesigned"" holes showed it as 479 yards...but it is actually 260. The old par 3 #17 is now a 250 yard par 4 and cart path only, with the path far from the fairway, requiring lengthy walks from the path, if you don't go for the green from the tee."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"All 5 par 3 holes play almost exactly the same length. Seriously, what course designer would do this??"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"From a distance (where they are selling homes from $700k-$1M, the course might look good, but trust me, it's a huge disappointment, even when using a greatly discounted coupon from Group Golfer."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Poor layout, poor service, slow pace, no course rangers. Paid $50 per person, which in hindsight was too much. Several public courses within 15 minutes of this course, all of which are much better courses."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,I've been to this course quite a few times over the years and this year the overall condition of the course just keeps going up!
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"The course has been under pretty major construction for the past few years and it has finally for the most part come to an end. All holes are now open and the new holes are about 90% fully grown in, there are a few bare spots in the new areas from irrigation issues from heads being runover and whatnot. The other reviewer who said the course was covered in bare spots and in terrible condition must be blind or just very drunk because the course was not bad at all."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"The new layout of having to cross the street to play #8-#9 is very strange and honestly creates a lot of congestion around the front of the clubhouse, and having to cut across 2 neighborhoods to get to 2 different tees is also a little strange but besides that it's not too bad."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"The worst part about this course is that a lot of the golfers don't follow the ""cart path only"" signs or when it is very wet out, you can see many spots around the course where golfers have made ruts in the rough or even fairways, I've even seen a few carts in the creek so I think they just have a lot of golfers who really really like driving through puddles."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Near bare fairways with weeds; Ridiculously unfair pin placements; many bare areas; inconsistent rough; poorly maintained and an illogical, generally boring up and down layout - almost parkland without the park."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Slow pace of play, concrete greens, the course value just doesn’t really match the price."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Front 9 was the better 9. Back 9 was extremely confusing. Through out he course you never have a sense of direction. Constantly flipping the scorecard over to see how to navigate. When to cross the road etc. a lot of holes share a cart path so it’s a bunch of intersections. Course was wet and cart path only so trying to not let that affect judgment.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Overall the course was in great shape, had some challenging holes and some not so much. Really enjoyed playing here and will definitely come back."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"I’ll preface this review w indont mind and often pay north of $75 for a round, but this was probably worth about $30 or so. 4:40 to play 18. Multiple groups ahead of us we’re super slow. At times we had 2 groups waiting w another on the tee on par 3s. One group finally just quit but it was still slow. No ranger, no starter, just kind of a free for all."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"The redesign of the course doesn’t make any sense. You cross the road for 8/9 then drive back for the back 9. The old holes were in fair shape for April in Indiana but the new holes were similar to a $30 course. It may turn out ok, but I’d wait a couple years before trying it again."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"For the $ I’d go play the Fort, or Bear slide, or make the drive and play Rock Hallow up in Peru. I might try it again in a couple years, but it needs some TLC and some course / pace of play help on the weekends."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Course was in great shape for early in year Still construction for housing and limiting to paths only made a bit challenging. Traps need more sand
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Course was still partly under revision construction. It should be good, once revisions are complete."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,The whole course remodel has ruined this course. The fact you pay for 18 holes but since one hole is closed down you get to only play 17. Very frustrating when you’re paying full price. Will no longer go to this course as it used to be a favorite but $60+ to play a partial course seems ridiculous. Would never have played had I known the condition and the course restructure.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Course is still undergoing big renovations but it very playable and greens were really good. Fun track. Cheap drinks. Nice staff and great pace of play. I would buy stock in this course, seems to be on the right track."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Only 17 holes are open, which was only downside (free par???)."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Course is in rough shape due to construction of housing developments. Once it’s finished it will be nice, but definitely not worth the money in the current state"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Lots of construction on course. Holes closed and relocated. Group of 5 playing holding up play. Lots of singles. They need to join them up.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Scheduled a last minute quick nine for Sunday morning for me, my wife and son. Staff was very nice and helpful. Course was being worked on but didn’t influence play. Will be back thanks."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"There were a few holes completely closed do to construction around course and others where the tee boxes were moved up. Currently it’s not worth the money. Hopefully, the owners will put some money and TLC into the course when construction is complete."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"The course was in good shape however, the course only has 17 holes open and to play the “18th” hole you have to figure out which additional hole you want to play. The rate ($65) on the weekends, given only 17 open holes and construction throughout, is too high. Please reconsider your rate. Hole 16 has a closed tee box and the tee box is a very short par four. It’s just under a lot of construction. Please reduce your rate as this did impact our experience.Thanks"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"They’re trying their best. But the course is under construction. So, for a discounted price this course is worth it. Staff is great."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"While this course is still under some construction, the whole course still plays well. Great staff, great people, great time."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Multiple holes were under repair and/or missing completely. Club house attendants did not mention the course was under construction and for the holes not under repair, the rough and bunkers were in very, very poor condition. As for the amenities, the course does not have a ""true"" driving range; Wood Wind's driving range is comprised of turf mats which require you to hit directly into a net approximately ten feet in front of you - no range at all. Overall, I would not recommend anyone spend $65 on a course of such poor quality - play elsewhere"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Course is under major construction yet they continue to charge full rates, terrible value. Layout is absurd, hopefully only due to the construction? I won't be back anytime soon and would avoid this course right now....maybe for the next couple years until construction is finished."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,I wish we had known the course was under significant construction and renovation before we booked. We encountered a group of 8 playing together. They eventually let us play through right before we were going to skip a hole to get past them. New holes have been constructed and one of the holes is currently unplayable. The scorecard gives Everyone a Par for that hole. So you are paying for 18 and playing 17 holes.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"I never really write reviews but Woodwind deserves a bad one. I used to love this course as it was typically in good shape and a good amount of the greens are challenging. Another benefit was that it's less than 1 minute away from my house. However, they started construction some time ago then raised the prices. Pace of play was excruciating. 5 1/2 hour round for a solo player is ridiculous. Constantly waiting 5+ minutes to tee off every hole. At least it was a beautiful day outside."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"The raised price of $65 is absurd, especially considering that the course is tore up in many spots. 6 par 3s, 400 yard par 5s? It's a joke. At best I'd maybe pay half to play here until the construction is completed. It seems that people have caught on and realized it's way over priced as the tee times appear to be wide open now."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"One thing Woodwind appears to have going for them is their head Pro, Elliot. He was very laid back and a pleasure to talk to during my checkin. Seemed to be an awesome guy."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"I know they need the money. But paying $52 for a long confusing par 3 course is a bit much. This course maybe done right when it is finished. But for right now, it is a mess and certainly not worth the money I paid. I’m sorry to say that. Because I want truly to support all things golf. But we played nearly 4 par 3 in a roll. One of my biggest complaints from both rounds I played there was the color of the tee boxes. I play blue normally and the blue they have is very close to the black. There were a group ahead of us that lived there. So during the round, they needed more beer. So they stopped at their house right after their tee shots. Carts left on the fairway, while they stock up for the back nine. This is a huge problem on Fathers Day, Sunday golf day, and golf etiquette. Sprinklers going all day. Got to 17 and 18 and was showered with water as you chip and putt. On 17 we were almost fire hosed down as the cycle randomly came on to water the green with a direct stream of heavy water flow. For what it is, that price needs to come down. Or they need to close until they have a golf course that can really be played and enjoyed. Also, if folks who live there want to play golf, that’s great. But if they want to stop off at home, it should be like going to the shack; you don’t tee off and sit your cart in the fairway."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"The course is still getting it's ""sea legs"" with the updates and construction winding down. We could have used better signage to know where to go, especially the new holes. The pricing is a bit high. Other than that, Woodwind is starting to come together nicely."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"50% of the course is basically under construction! There is major work being done on many holes and not just the ones involved in the housing development portion of the course. Almost all of the bunkers had little to no sand in them. Many areas where the grass has not been cut in a while, grass 8""-12"" high. The water sprinklers kept coming on during much of the round right when we were hitting and only a few feet away causing several of us to get very wet. It seems like they have way too much going on at one time while still keeping the course open and very busy with golfers. And despite all the construction and torn up sections they still are charging full price to play. We all knew that tearing up this course to add houses was not going to be a good thing, and it has proved true. This was a very good course prior to the plan to build houses on the property. There was absolutely NO need to do this as there was plenty of land close by to be used for new housing developments. Just another greedy land grab by developers and officials. Not the kind of experience we were expecting. We will not be returning!"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Good course, challenging and very well maintained. Renovation/updates made it a bit challenging in knowing how to finish the front 9, but still overall it was a great course!"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"I understand the course needing renovation but to tear up as much of the course as they have at one time impacts play tremendously!! Wish they would have spread things out. Also, the yardage on the new holes seems off to non-existant. Curious how league play will be affected by the construction b"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,I thought the course was a very cool course. I’m glad I got a chance to play it. My review is a bit under rated only because of the construction improvements they are currently doing. I walk and the walk from #4 skipping #5 to resume on #6 is a bit far. I would also like the tee boxes marked a bit better. Played the back tees and sometimes they are paired with the blue. With so much elevation change; it’s hard sometimes to tell where the separate tee boxes are. But course experience can fix that. Greens were firm and moderately quick in places. Really liked the two new holes on the north side. Need improvements to the cart path there though. Seen a single I played with try to squeeze through and no room to stay off the soil which will leave holes pretty quick once the season gets in full swing. A very good course overall really. Practice area is a good representation of the course.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Our first time on this course, reserved through golf now. It’s was quite windy! I understand that it was above and beyond normal wind conditions. The staff were nice in the shop and at the snack bar; didn’t see any staff directing starts. LOTS of construction going on which keeps this in the 3.5-4 star rating. Pace of play was good and greens and fairways in good condition considering the time of year. Bunkers need some work. I imagine when the construction is over it will be a nicer experience.. If you live north of the beltway, probably worth the drive. We are located centrally so may not return for awhile."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"I was nervous playing this course as people have mentioned there is construction. There definitely is and it’s noticeable. Ideally, you won’t be bothered by it by not ever shot is ideal. I had to pick up out of the dirt construction zones a few times and play from there. A couple holes are completely out of play but they do have two new holes to make up for it so you get the full 18. Overall, it wasn’t terrible since I got it for a hot deal but I wouldn’t have been happy if I paid clubhouse price. The course would be very nice without active construction. Conclusion: ~$25 or less, yeah play, anything over that I’d go to a different course"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Challenged by traps and the occasional water. Great layout!
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"The course, with construction of a housing development on both sides of the course, is difficult to maneuver. holes #10 and #18 are closed and a new par three and par 4 are being used in place of these holes. I was disappointed with the course conditions where construction is taking place. The greens were great and the other holes are in great condition."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"The course is torn up with all sorts of construction going on for a housing development that is being implemented on both sides of the course. #10 and #18 are closed and a new par three and par 4 are being used in place of these holes. I will not be back to play this year. Very disappointed with the course conditions where construction is taking place. The greens were very good and the other holes are in fine shape, but it is a shame the course is experiencing this kind of construction."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,No where on the website did it say they would have construction on the course. There were multiple times I had to pick up my drive to move around construction equipment in the fairway. I will not be back this year.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Used to be a good golf course. Now, with the encroachment of housing developments, the course has been fragmented and slung all over the place. I quit after nine. Won’t be back."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"The course was in great shape especially for this time of year. As finances allow, the concrete cart paths need serious attention."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Given the time of year this course is still in fabulous shape
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"The staff were great. Very friendly etc. We were told to go to the first hole and pair up. No one showed except two guys who said they had the tee time after us but were in a hurry. We let them go first.The layout was fine but the signage was lacking. Since it was our first time there, it was sometimes difficult to know where to go next. The cart paths were in disrepair and some fairways were not the best.I would recommend playing with someone who knew the course."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Slow play, forced to join another group. Course condition...needs a lot of work."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Have played course 4 times this year. Sand traps need sand and drainage fixed.. pin placements today on minimum 9 holes were at edges of green on severe slopes.. obviously greens keeper was in crappy mood.. they were ridiculously impossible on some holes. Like a challenge but....
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Greens are in very good shape . Fairways are wide and well maintained. Ranger should encourage slow players to move up to shorter tee boxes and spend less time ball hunting. Dig a little deeper in sand traps so the hard pan is deeper.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,No a lot of choices on the nw side this one is worth a play. They have it in good shape and have some good deals compared to the others.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"This course is just 7 minute drive from my house so I played here several times this year.Basically fairly easy course except few holes and fairways are wider than average.You can expect many slow players especially on weekends so please be patient if you think you are an above average golfer.Overall this is well maintained and nice course, but I would give 5 star if this course has actual driving range."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,We used to live 3 miles from the course and moved away 3 years ago and the course has had only super improvements.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Holes like #10 which was really hard hole in past ihad some trees removed.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Similarly par 3 #17 which was pretty hole is gorgeous now.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Practice chipping area is amazing.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,If you play in a foursome be prepared to be followed by singles and twosomes who want to play through. They also sent off 9 hole groups ahead of us on #10 as we made the turn.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,We had a great day. Staff super friendly and helpful. Pace of a play was great even with the typical slow downs on par 3s. Course was in great condition too!
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"The layout features some very good holes and the course was in good condition (at least by my standards anyway). It was cart path only when I played and that can get a bit annoying when you aren't very accurate. I had some problems figuring out the cart paths (I usually walk, but the cart came with the golfnow rate), but that was probably just me. I doubt I would ever pay $49 to play here, but I wouldn't pay that to play anywhere given the state of my game."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"The course was in great shape, except for several of the sand traps. They were mostly mud with a thin layer of sand on top.The course and pace of play were excellent! We played 18 in 3.5 hours on a Sunday morning.I was not a fan of the new tee box set up. I’m not sure why all of the tee boxes were moved forward. Are they trying to speed up play? I. Any event, when the tee boxes were back, the little creek came into play on several holes, making strategy more fun."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Course is in great condition. Grass is green everywhere in spite of semi drought conditions. Staff is super friendly and the food in the snack bar is best around (especially the cheese burgers)!
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Course seems to be makin large improvements over last several years. Future plans show the course is adding two new holes in the future. Chipping area is amazing. Greens could use some work.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"A great affordable course near home, but offset by no ranger on duty again. Single players jump in ahead and behind and disrupt the rhythm of groups playing holes in order. Paid for 18 but left after 9 when another single cut in front on 10 tee. Getting worse every week. Lodged a complaint in the clubhouse, and the teen running it said he’d “pass it along....”"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,I’m a member at the club and I have been running into pace issues almost every time I play... today was the worst however. The group in front of me had 2 groups in front of them and I was unable to tee off until 1:50 for my 1:30 tee time. The time added up and by the time I finished my round I was an hour and 15 minutes behind the typical 4.5 hour pace it normally takes to play 18 at woodwind. There was no martial to be seen all day (on a Sunday) arguably the busiest day for golf. The course is wonderful but the pace is a real stick in the mud.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Wood Wind Golf Club in Westfield, IN. proved to be a very pleasant surprise. While it was my first round there my son had played it before. In his words the course ""has been seriously better maintained"" then when he last played there 2 or 3 years ago. We played from the blue tee's and found the course to be pretty straight forward with some challenging par 4's and par 3's. The par 5 holes were a little shorter which was fine for us. What us noteworthy here is the swale and hills that are noticeable as you travel the course. The greens were well kept and fair with a good amount of break in play on many holes. ALL the sand traps are being repaired and re-filled with a higher quality material. They are getting to the point of finishing those and they are very well done.So overall a nice track that is fairly priced. I recommend it for a casual, fair round for the casual golfer."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,The greens did not hold but they putted true. The fairways were too hard.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"As mentioned above, Wood Wind has a great short game practice area that I really liked a lot as I was warming up. The course was just average for me though. It was nearly impossible to find your ball in the rough if you hit it off line. The greens were healthy, but rolled a bit on the slow side. Hole # 6 and #13 were my personal favorites, and while the course does have a few really nice holes, there are also some rather boring holes mixed in. All in all, 3/5 experience."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"First time playing this course, wasn’t sure what to expect. Pleasantly surprised.The course layout and condition are top notch.Pace of play was excellent.Staff at pro shop was very friendly and courteous.Greens look faster than they really are and they will challenge you as they don’t always break like you think they will.There are some bunkers under repair but it didn’t interfere with our play.I would recommend this course without hesitation. I have every intention of playing this one again, many times!"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Expect this course to be in great condition as the weather improves.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"We were able to get the Hot Deal here. Despite all the rain and wet weather, the course was very playable...Fairways and greens were in great shape. We will be back soon."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Course updates from previous year are really good. Played course last year....and it’s in much better condition. Greens were a little slow and hairy.....but overall great course.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Nice course in good shape and has an enjoyable layout! Open enough for a slight wayward shot to recover but challenging enough to keep you on your game
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Booked Through golf now, arrived a little early the staff was friendly very courteous and let us go off 15 minutes early which I appreciated the course was in immaculate shape, also love the layout of the courseI would highly recommend this course to my friend"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,I had an amazing round of golf. I played 18 holes in just over 3 hours. Even during these crazy times the staff was friendly and attentive.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Good course conditions, can see the work and improvements being done. New holes are shaping up nicely. Best of all scoring requires good play, period."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,The course was in great condition. Greens well healed from mid October airation. Sand traps were raked. Some greens were dew covered but I don’t expect them to be mowed this time of the year.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Couldn’t pass on 50 plus day middle of Nov. course in best shape in last several yrs.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"after getting over 2 inches of rain the day before, and battling 20 mph cross winds, WoodWind was a strong challenge and in great shape. Friendly staff and I am looking forward to future rounds!"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Played course after 1 inch rain the day before. Course drained very well. The layout was fantastic, challenging all types of golfers. The greens had recently been aerated and with time they will roll well. Only complaint was the placement of some of the holes on the greens. Had a couple placements on horrible slopes making putting next to impossible. Those however are easily addressed. Course is also tough to trace and find the next holes, especially for newbies. Identification of holes could be better. Very good experience and well worth my time to play. Would certainly go back, and recommend to others!"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Played a morning/afternoon round after a night of heavy rain. Course was in great shape and not many soggy areas. Bunkers had water as expected, but don’t hit them there...Overall not a very difficult course. Fairly open layout let’s you tee it high and let it fly on many holes with little risk. Would recommend and look forward to playing again."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Except for some of the sand bunkers, the course was in excellent condition. fairways were close to perfect and the greens were very good. Very much worth the price."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Greens were fairly fast and firm. Would like sand to be less hard packed around greens. Beauty fairways. Great value for money.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"It's been many years since I last played Wood Wind, and I cannot believe the difference. The greens are in marvelous shape - and fasssssst! The staff was very friendly.I think it's the best golf value in Central Indiana. Like The Terminator, I'll be back - and bring my friends, too."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Course was a little short, but had some difficult greens to make up for it! A couple of the hole transitions were confusing for first timers. Staff was friendly and helpful as well. Great course overall!"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Don't know if all the construction is to blame but the course has a lot of areas that seem neglected. Many of the sand traps are just dirt with lots of pebbles/rocks. Lots of crabgrass and weeds. Cartpaths are deteriorating and need some attention. Last few times we have played there we saw ZERO maintenance people anywhere on the course. Will have to wait and see what the new holes are like next season. The short game practice area looks nice but the removal of the driving range is sad. Paying to hit balls into a net is a joke,."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Right in the middle of our round they started a girls high school golf match. A shotgun start on several of the holes with no notification from the clubhouse that they would be starting right in front of us. We weren’t even able to play all the holes in our round. Very disappointing
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,The course was very well maintained. It has GPS in carts. There was a snack/drink cart that came around. The clubhouse had some good options to choose from in the snack bar. the staff was very polite and friendly. I will play there again.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Drove up to Westfield to play this course. Greeted with a small net as their “warm up area” - no range. $5 to hit balls into a net is your warmup. Practice putting area was tiny and not well managed and only had 3 practice holes to putt at with about 6 people already on it. Needless to say, I wasn’t thrilled with the warm up.Luckily, I played pretty decent and the course had some good looking holes after you get past #5. It was really busy and the holes wind back and forth over each other so about once a hole you hear “FOUR!” as a ball wizzes close to your cart.If you find a deal and can’t play anywhere else, it’s a decent course. But if you live anywhere more than 10-15 minutes away, I wouldn’t make the trip."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"WoodWind is a nice easy course with good GPS information and greens that are pretty well maintained. The course was nearly wide open, so our foursome played at our own pace and probably took too long, but never had anyone waiting on us. I would have liked more visible water stations and trash cans. The cart came around with drinks and snacks three times and that was perfect. I hope to play here again very soon."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Played Woodwind for the first time in many years. Course was in better than average condition for our recent dry conditions. Couldn’t stay long, but played 15 holes in three hours, so pace was quick. I’ll go back soon."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"I must admit, I was pretty hard on the conditions of this course in the past. I was extremely impressed with the condition of the course during my round. This was the first time playing this course this year. The greens are much more receptive to approach shots and the fairways and tee boxes were very well manicured. Elliot was very attentive during check in as well. Woodwind is headed in the right direction and it shows. Nice to see the improvements especially in a time when we have had very little rain and some extreme heat. Well done!"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,We enjoyed the course it was in very good shape except the bunkers were very rocky. The staff was friendly and the cart serving beverages came by several times which was nice on a hot day.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,overall a wonderful course to play at and the food and drinks are very reasonably priced compared to other courses. this is a course that is perfect for any skill level and still provide a challenge to seasoned players. my only real issue would be that they need to have pest control come out at some point for the sand traps i hit out of one and wasps started flowing out of a hole in the ground. over all a good experience and i plan on coming back some day in the near future.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,This course has quite a few stand out holes that you will remember.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"I live very near Wood Wind, but have only played a few times in the last 10 years because of the declining condition of the course. Decided to try it out last week on a weekday afternoon because of a special deal. Was very happy to find the course in great condition. Greens, fairways and teeboxes were all in great condition. Only disappointment was the sand traps - while raked well, seem to be almost as much ""dirt"" as good sand. Very difficult to hit consistent shots out of them.Overall, though - very happy with the improved conditions, and have added Wood Wind back on to a course I would be happy to play any time."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Wood Wind Golf Course is a strong test of golf. The layout of the course is interesting and there are a few holes that are difficult to know where to place your tee shot in order to be in position for the approach. There is a lot of elevation changes that challenge your accuracy. My only complain is with the greens. I thought the speed was inconsistent from green to green. I would play Wood Wind again and definitely recommend it to friends!
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"The instability of the golf course, rumors of closing, has had an effect on it. They have clearly been working on the greens, and they are coming around, but the fairways, fringe and rough are below average at best. Bunkers are mostly dirt, and that is unacceptable, even with the amount of rain we have had. The GolfNow got Deal is the only reason I was there, and will be the only reason I might go back."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"We played on a day with weather that was horrid....wet, windy and the course was soaked. OUR choice to play, so no fault of the course. I enjoy this course, and so will you."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Visiting and playing golf in Indiana for the first time. Playing at Wood Wind golf course was a great experience. The wind was really blowing and the fairways was a little wet. The tee box and putting greens were in great condition.The golf pro was really helpful and friendly. I would recommend this golf course to all my friends to come out to Westfield, Indiana and play this golf course. This town is really booming, houses are going up all around this golf course. Come out and visit this upcoming town. The PGA should think about having one of there tournament here! This course have a tee box from : Red, White, Gold, Blue and Black! The Par-5 was a little short, but the Par-3 were long. They were 175 and above and playing around 190 with the wind! I probably play here one more time before I go back to Connecticut!"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,My first time out early in the season. Course in good condition with exception of bunkers which were excellent. I’ve found public courses struggle to keep enough sand and manicured.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Greens were a bit slow, but probably due to early in the season. Typically, the course has fast and fair greens."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"I played mid-day and it was busy, but played fast (3 hours for 18)."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"A lot of construction in area, but it did not affect the course."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,All and all would recommend and plan to go back.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"I played the course many years ago...and frankly the course wasn't as good as it should be. BUT NOW with new management and capable/caring course superintendent,, the course is as good as it has been in years. I found the staff to be super-friendly and that the food and beverage department has really improved. I encourage you to come check it out!"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"I have been playing 1-2 rounds every year for last 3-4 yrs, and I have seen this GC maintenance sliding below average. If it is not for Hotdeal round I played today, I wouldn't have chosen this round. On regular days this GC rips $60 for a golf round, which is not worth the money."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,I thought the staff was awesome! She was informative and very nice. The course was in outstanding shape for the time of year...the bunkers were even groomed! Thank you for having me!
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Lovely Course w some beautiful holes on a beautiful day, hard to beat it!"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"This course was in excellent condition from tee to green. The new short game practice area is a great concept and well designed.Using the hot deal let us play for $40 per person which is a great value for this type of course and the area.My only criticism would be the cart paths were rough and a few spots too rough, but the course itself was immaculate."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"My fiancée and I went to play golf there for the first time, we had a great time. Easy to play and get around, however it could get a bit crowded since the layout has different holes very close to each other."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"The course was in great shape the greens were perfect the course layout is great and the staff was very friendly , I will definitely play this course again"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Woodwind is undergoing changes to make it astate of the art practice facility. The course ischallenging even though changes have been madeto make it more player friendly and improve pace of play. The carts have a GPS yardage device, butunfortunately ours was not online yet and we couldfind only a few physical yardage markers.Very fun course, tho, and the pro shop staff were very friendly and helpful. Can’t wait for a returnvisit!"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Course is solid...and challenging. Staff is the best around (tied with Trophy Club). Great beer for a fair price. I'll be back!
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,My first time playing here and it was cold and windy. Started to sleet on our 17th hole. I felt the course was a nice layout and challenging. Greens had been aerated and I think that effected the roll and hold.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"The course is in very good shape. I brought a few friends that had not played here before, and they enjoyed their round."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Course was in great shape but the restrooms were. filthy with no tp or towels. Looked a hundred years old and the worst I had seen on high dollar course.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Course has a good layout with challenging par 4's. Staff was great and friendly. Tee boxes are covered in crab grass and bunkers are dirt boxes with rocks in them. Fairways & greens are in good shape. Not worth $45 in my opinion in those conditions.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,New tees and layout since last played. Good time and a great day
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Enjoyed the open fairways and overall course conditions.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"There are definitely better to places to play compared to this. I enjoyed playing here when the course was newer, but now it is very run down. I couldn't tell the different between the rough and the fairway. The pace of place was horrific, so much so that we had to quit with two holes left. The pro working that day was also very unfriendly and really unwelcoming. I was genuinely excited to play because I used to love playing this course, but I was thoroughly disappointed, so I would go play somewhere else."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"I hadn't played here in a few years. I thought the course was going to close. So I was pleasantly surprised to find the course in such good shape. Pace of play was a little slow, but it was Father's Day.We will be back."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,It had been several years since I last played the course (it had a different name the last time I was there) and I was pleased to find it just as good. I mistakenly reserved a tee time for Thursday and showed up on Wednesday. They were kind enough to transfer my tee time over and still charged me the Golfnow rate. The course was in great shape and remains a good test. I'll be back the next time I return to the area.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Course tee boxes weren’t in the best shape. While playing, the course had water sprinklers going on a couple of holes.But all in all, was good."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"First time playing this course - we had a great time. Fun layout, challenges abound without overtaking the round. Small creeks on many holes but fairly wide open makes for a fun time. Will definitely return!"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,First time out this year. Extremely windy early spring day. Had to pull out the sand wedge many times. Several bunkers around most Greens. Greens were very small and challenging. Most Fairways were wide open but the creek running through the course made the drives a bit more interesting on several holes. Will definitely play again this summer.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"The course has a very interesting and challenging layout, though it does get a little crowded together in a few spots. There is a lot of elevation change and a stream that cuts through several holes. You need to play it at least once to know where to go/miss."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"The problem there is the conditioning. the 6th green is under repair, and you play a temp green in the fairway. Several other greens were patchy in spots. All were rock hard and impossible to hold if you flew it to the green, especially in the gusty winds we played in today. Even chips just ran forever and the greens were extremely fast. Several fairways had some patchy spots as well, and many tees were pretty chewed up."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Overall if you can get a good rate on it it's worth a go. Not sure the conditions are worth full freight right now, but maybe as the summer commences it will improve. I enjoyed the layout enough that i'll go back and find out."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Played in 3 hours, tee boxes in pretty bad shape, fairway very good, sand was ok, greens rolled pretty good pretty fast. They are working on a few greens one is completely closed."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"One round is all it took to remind me I would prefer to play anywhere else but this course. Lost $10 in cooler deposits because the clubhouse was closed when we finished our round. (closes at 8pm) Not to mention, a $5 deposit per cooler for coolers that tiny, leaky pieces of junk is absurd. They were supposed to mail me my $$ back but it has been over 2 weeks and nothing. This is on top of a course that was poorly designed when it was built, is never in good shape (tee boxes look like they have not been mowed in days, some greens have large bare spots, and crab grass everywhere, and bunkers, yeah let's not talk about that), and is obviously understaffed. The city of Westfield should have allowed this place to be turned into a subdivision, no one will really miss it. Do yourself a favor and just drive 10 mins east and play that other Westfield course, it is cheaper, nicer, and well staffed. And they have the nicest golf carts around."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"In the last few years this course has been on a rapid decline. From the friendliness of the management staff to the quality of the course, everything about this course has been on the decline. It is not worth the time (expect a 5+ hour round on the weekend), not worth the money ($40 greens fee when bunkers, tee boxes, and greens are all in need of work), or hassle (better customer service needed from entire management staff). There are plenty of other courses in the area at this price point that are better worth your time and money."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Wonderful late season value. Course is in very nice condition. It wss wet when we played but the course does a good job of absorbing water.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"I had not played Wood Wind in several years. The course has been improved considerably since then. Fairways and greens were in very good shape. Pace of play was exceptional in that our foursome played in four hours. A very scenic course with lots of mature trees and just enough water to make the course a challenge, If you have not played Wood Wind in a while I would suggest you go back for a solid golf value."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Hadn't played the course in over 25 years when it was known as Hanging Tree GC. The course was as I remembered with lots of forced carries over a meandering creek that still presented a challenge for me, even from the Senior (gold) tees."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,My wife and I were behind a twosome which was behind a disgustingly slow foursome that was oblivious to the groups that were playing behind them. Further compounding our situation was a foursome behind us that kept hitting into us.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"The course was in good condition overall, and we rationalized the experience that a bad day on the links was definitely better than a good day working for a living."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Excellent condition considering late summer drought conditions - very challenging creek running through 10 holes - very cordial staff
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"This was my first time at Wood Wind. I was expecting an average golf course. In contrast to my expectations, I experienced a wonderful golf course with a very friendly staff. I went to the course by myself and the starter allowed me to begin my play at hole four. This was convenient and I was able to play at my desired pace. In addition, the course offered many challenging and entertaining holes with difficult but fair greens."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Wife and I enjoyed the course with grandkids. No pressure. Family friendly atmosphere. Good value on Golf now.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Need to know where the creek is for shot placement. Play the right tees for your game. Some par 4 over 400yds. good layout that held my attention.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"The course was in decent shape the greens however were very hard and would not hold a shot. The staff seem to be very unfriendly when we checked in and one of the marshals actually stopped us and let a twosome through which I don't normally have a problem with, I will let any buddy who plays faster go however they seem to know the Marshall. He called them by their first names, my guess was they were members. Then told us we need to speed up, we were on pace and there was nobody pushing from behind. Not sure where the twosome came from. All in all a decent course however I will not go back. Too many other nice courses with friendly staff to deal with that"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Course in great shape. Surprized not busier on a perfect/80 degree/sunny Friday in July. But just proves-Indianapolis has a lot of good golf courses-so must remain competitive on price.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"This course is in beautiful shape, the staff is awesome, friendly and courteous. I was waiting for my friends and the starter was giving me a nice rundown of the course. Would highly recommend Wood Wind golf club!!"
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Good course for the money. Greens and fairways in good shape for a public course this time of the year. The rangers are good guys, always friendly and funny."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Good value, course in good condition. Best condition greens have been in."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,We had an 11:57 am tee time on a Saturday and the pace of play was great. Course was in good condition. I would definitely recommend this course.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,This was my first time playing this course. Our party had a great time. The course was in great condition with the exception of one or two holes where the fairways were a little torn up. But for a beginner golfer it was great. The course has water and plenty of bunkers that come into play. I will play at this course again.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,This is a good moderately difficult course. The staff was very friendly and accommodating especially with my young grand son. We will be back!
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Needs attention bc they were overbooked. Did not get my money's worth. Text text text text
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Course was not in the best of shape. It was fun to play, but it should have been in much better shape this time of year. We have had a lot of Rain this Spring and there were some areas that were browning already. Would have expected more from the course. It has been one of the top courses in the area over the last 10 years."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"This was my first time playing Wood Wind. I got a Hot Deal, so I only paid $20. After playing, i would be willing to pay full price to return. Great course. A lot of different holes, with water and sand. Greens were very fast, but in great shape. I would definitely recommend trying this place out."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,I had heard some good things about this course via word of mouth so me and a friend decided to check it out. The staff/starter was by far my favorite part of this course. The course itself was a lot more worn than I was expecting. The fairways seemed to be brutalized and no one had bothered to try and repair them. The bunkers needed attention because it was like hitting out of packed mud. Greens weren't too bad but still it was like the people that play this course on a regular basis don't repair their divots in the fairways or ball marks on the green. There were a few interesting holes including #15 that made it better. I guess because of the location they like to charge a little more but if they are gonna do that at least take better care of the course. Try it if you would like something new but I'm not gonna recommend it to any of my friends.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Greens and fairways in very good condition, for this time of year. Rough has some areas with tall grass and clumps of dead cut grass, but in general most roughs were cut to an acceptable length with no signs of dead cut grass. Pace of play was very good. I will play this course again."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Very wide open lay-out, you can make a big mistake off the tee & still play it from most anywhere. It was very well maintained for a very wet last few weeks & staff is awesome, though not sure it's a $40 plus course, but we will be back."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"We were able to get a 12:00 hot deal tee time. We had one group in front of us and after playing through them the course was clear. We were able to play in about 3.5 hours, which was nice. The course was in good shape. Enjoyed the day."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,I will definitely play at Woodwinds again. Hopefully Soon!
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Nice course with a variety of holes that force a variety of shots. There is a shared green, which is the first time I've played a course with that. The practice facility is also nice with a chipping area right next to the range so you can chip from a simulated fairway which is not common around here. It was early in the year so the grass hasn't had a chance to allow me to fairly rate the course conditions. Judging by what I saw, though, I'm sure the conditions are well maintained during the normal golf season."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"The only reason it took 4 of us 4 1/2 hours is, we were in no hurry and it was cart path only due to the recent weather."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"My home course is going down hill (PB) so we playedwood wind for a third time, and it hooked us."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Greens roll very nicely, the starter was kind, and what really showed the attention to detail was....it was 50dg out and slightly breezy and they still had a refreshment cart out on the course I love that...! I think it speeds up the turn...."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"Well done Wood Wind staff, you just landed 4 new players."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Shawn.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"I played in nine hole Masters Par 3 Contest that they we're having.It was very fun to take part in. They took the the first nine hole made them into nine Par 3 holes. It was 20 dollars to play it and 5 dollars for entry fee. On Golfnow the tee time when I played was 22 dollars for 18 with cart, so the golf club let me play the Par 3 Contest two time and all I had to pay for was the two 5 dollar entry fees. So I saved 18 dollars on what it would have cost me at the club house to play."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"This course is fun to play. A bit challenging, and plays longer than it's yardage. Always in good condition, and offers a good combination of distance with green slope/hills. Unfortunately, it also always takes too long to play (average 4.5 hours)."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"For what the fees are without Golf.now,seems like GPS is in line this day and age to speed play or at least easy to find 150 and 100 markers."
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,Course was in great shape for late November in Indiana. Staff was very friendly with lots of great deals in the pro shop.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,The course has great challenges but very difficult
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,The course was in pretty good shape considering it was the first week in november.
Wood Wind Golf Club,5984-wood-wind-golf-club,"The course was in good shape but some of the greens were pretty beat up. Didn't really fit with the overall shape of the course, but I would definitely play it again, as I know it was a tough summer for golf courses."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Everything was perfect except they couldn’t make it warmer.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,We love playing here. Course is nice and the staff is so friendly and helpful!
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Staff is always friendly and accommodating. Was not too busy on a Wednesday, which they say is their slowest day. Course could use some rain for sure, but fun to play."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Very good layout. Very fast greens ! Sand traps not ready for play ! Some very tight holes such as #3.Lots of hard holes as well as some easy.I like this course!
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,We had such a good time. The hotdogs were good too
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"The staff we saw was super friendly but the course was in pretty rough shape. I used to play here around 10 years ago and it used to be a great value for a nice course. Now, it’s the same price by the cart paths were in bad shape, the greens were incredibly hard and had several patches of just black, and the carts were incredibly slow. There were only 2 ball cleaners on the whole course, neither of which had any fluid in them. It’s still a nice setting outside town, but the course has not been kept up as well. It used to be a good value, now I feel like paying that much is overcharging for the course."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"First time playing this course. Extremely nice people and the best chicken salad sandwich I've every had. The greens are fantastic. The course however is quite challenging and requires you hitting it straight. If you don't hit it Stright most of the time it much more difficult. Heavy tree lined with overhanging branches on tee boxes too! Even some Par 3's have overhanging branches you have to avoid. One par 3 you can 't see the green from tree and high grass around the pond. From the back tees it's 195 mostly all carry. Some strange holes too where even if you are in the fairway, you don't have a clear shot to the pin. Pacesetters were hitting mulligans all day, so it was super slow, and the course was packed. It's a very tight course so be prepared."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,This course is really improved throughout the years. It is a very challenging good good place to play golf.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Played this course twice in the last couple weeks. Course is in good condition, greens are good. Staff is super friendly."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Not a particularly great layout. Lots of tree lined repetiveness but a few holes were intriguing. Not very busy on a weekday. Played 18 in less than 3 hours
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Different kind of course and a bit of a throwback. Just a par-70 and the layout uses well-placed trees and doglegs to provide various risk-reward options. The staff was super-friendly, wisely sending me out on the back nine to keep the round moving. Definitely worth the occasional visit as a change of pace."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,I really enjoyed the layout tight conditions on certain holes water hazards in critical places really enjoyed
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,This is not a $60 a round course but a good place to go for a round with friends they are play ever once in a while. Not overly challenging but still not boring.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Played this annually while visiting friends in the area. It is a nicely maintained course and provides good value for the money, especially on a Hot Deal Tee Time. Staff is always friendly and appreciates your business. Playing on a weekday usually provides a very relaxed pace of play. Greens were in great condition and rolled nicely. I recommend a visit if my description is what you are looking for."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Been playing there for years and it’s never been in better shape. Golf course is beautiful
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Good condition overall.Course layout requires controlled shots to avoid hazards. A good challenge and greens in very good shape.Enjoyable.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"The course was fun and I plan on going back. There did not seem to be markers for distance to the green and no GPS on the carts, so determining what club to use was not easy for people playing the course for the first time."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,The staff that I spoke with were very friendly and helpful.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,First time playing this course in about 5 years.It was me and my son..After we played hole 4 we had to call the front and ask where hole 5 was. We looked for a about 15 minutes. .Lady up front was very helpful. But after she came out to show us where hole 5 was. Me and my son was talking and said that looks like we played on the wrong hole at 3 & 5.With it still being early in season they didn't have the Hole #'s Marked and it was difficult to stay on track. So it was very frustrating for sure.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,We will be back but differently not early in the season.I do believe all locations should but if the golf course is open.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Great sunny day out and the course was packed on a Sunday, so overall play was extremely slow. Unfortunately came behind a group of 3 on the 14th or 15th hole that just appeared out of no where. The first 2 guys hit 2 balls each, and the third guy hit 2….three his club wasted more time, then hit a third ball into the water…..threw his club and wasted more time. When he asked his friends for his 4th ball I drove around them and just skipped that hole."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Everything was great. Course was in good shape the winter time the way it is trees. They finally took down because they were dead opened up the course a little better and shatter too recommended.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,This course is well maintained and challenging. Greens extra fast this round. We enjoyed playing here and will be back
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,We always have a great time playing here. The course was in good condition.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"We absolutely love playing this course. The course was in great shape, the staff was ultra friendly and we had a wonderful round."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,First time playing here and would come back. Nice layout and in good shape. Provides chances to score. Played on a Monday and pace was great. Owners and staff were super friendly.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,This course was in great shape. We always love playing here.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Driving into the parking lot, looked like the maintenance side of a country club, club house was more like a bait shop at a fishing lake, but the course was great. Layout was tough yet fair. As a first time player, even the blind drives were open enough for forgiveness. The fairways and greens were in great shape. Only complaint, didn’t seem to group singles and couples together. We paired with a single, we were a twosome.and still found us catching up to the pair and single in front of us. While the twosome behind us on our heels. Luckily they played 9, we made the turn and finished just over 4 hour round."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,as good as shape as I have seen. greens rolling well as well as fairways. only drawback was no water coolers out. kudos to maintenance crews.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"After reading some of the reviews I was somewhat skeptical about what the course would look like and even whether I wanted to play it. I must say though I cannot seem to figure out why some of the negative reviews are there. I guess people expect every golf course to be a PGA style course.The course was in great shape. With the normal few issues on the tee beds ( which is to be expected with a lot of play) and a few areas on the greens ( which I don't recall ever came into play when putting ) the course and the experience was great.Loved the layout as no two holes were really the same. The greens rolled great and consistent.So disregard the negative reviews and go experience this course,"
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,I was trying to enjoy my day off and play some golf well I finish up my front 9 and head to the back 9 and the guys in front of me were playing rlly slow and when I asked to play through they very rudely told me that I needed to find another hole to start on bc they’re in a “league” so I just left terrible experience and would recommend bluff creek to anyone In the area
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,The course was nice the greens need some help. The greens are challenging but some rough spots. Cart had a flat half way through then the next cart seemed loose steering. Lost several balls on decent shots.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"I visit annually from Colorado, and have found Eagle Pines to be a great value. I play with someone who doesn’t play regularly, so we use our phone GPS to set up par 3 lengths on the holes. Makes it a nice warmup and allows me to figure out my clubs’ yardages at lower altitude than I normally play. Lady at check- in was very nice, and maintenance crews were respectful when they were near us during play. No, it’s not Bandon Dunes, but I’m not Scottie Scheffler either. 😄"
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,We had a great round of golf. The course was in good shape and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Fun course to play. Little tlc needed on fairways and greens. Staff could have been a bit more friendly.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"The course had some rough spots, but they appear to be working on them. Good value."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,I’ve played here 3 times now over the years. This is definitely a last resort type of golf course. The lady/owner working the counter is definitely not in the right industry. Show some hospitality. Do yourself a favor and pay a little extra to go play a real golf course.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Cart was filthy, and limbs were down all over the course. Otherwise, it was ok."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"It’s a decent course that’s fun to play, for not a lot of money. They could use newer carts and ball washers."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"We always have a great time playing here. The course was in good shape, and we had a blast. The hotdog was pretty tasty too."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Some of the greens where not in great shape. Course itself, fairways in good shape. Need water coolers on course with cups for drinking."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,I thought the course was a great course to play. There were a few interesting holes that I will be going back to just for those holes. I played for $17 including cart through the GolfNow app. It was absolutely worth it.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Fairways and T boxes are very ragged. Several greens have large brown sections and few of the greens offer true rolls. Some of the holes are overly protected with overgrown trees that overhang the fairways making an approach shot impossible from a drive in any part of the fairway. Correcting these problems would make this a 4 star course, As is, it is a 2."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Don’t play here for 30 bucks expecting the world . A little easy but a fun course
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"This is not a top tier track, but a well maintained every-man course which is very affordable. tee boxes and greens were well attended. Fairways were a little long, although I'm sure that is a function of the hot weather. Not the most challenging or scenic course around, but hey, it cost under $30. In fact, the only thing keeping me from playing regularly is the 55 minute drive from my hood."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Staff is always friendly. Always free refills on fountain drinks. 4 hour pace of play on a weekend is appreciated.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,This course was in the best shape since I started playing 8 years ago.Greens were smooth and fast !Fairways were bouncing and rolling.It has some very tight and tough holes.Staff bent over backwards to please us.Very enjoyable !!!Bill G
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Overall, the course was in great condition. Roughs were a bit overgrown and in need of mowing. Greens were decently fast. Not pool table fast, but good. The layout is not overly challenging. The staff is super friendly and outgoing. I would not hesitate to recommend this course."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Nice layout with good conditions. We actually used a gps to set par 3 distances to greens and played Eagle Pines as a par 3 course. This beat driving to a true par 3 course. Always a good value here.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,No major consBunkers need filled in as with a lot of courses that can’t maintain themNeed a few better yardage markersProsCourses in good shapeGreens pretty smooth and consistent speedFairways goodLadies in clubhouse couldn’t be any nicer seem generally really like to have your business
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Always love playing this course. It is well taken care of, and they have good hotdogs!"
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Love this Course been playing here for years. But we were behind a foursome that was extremely slow. Some holes they were waiting for the green to clear before hitting their drives. At times 3 groups were backed up. Turned out being an expensive 9 holes because we didn't have the patience to play the Back 9.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Good early in the year, before the need for irrigation."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"The one complaint I had was that there were no yardage markers on the course, unless I just didn’t see them. It made it very hard to judge distances and hit the right shot."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"This place is a joke. The pace of play and the locals make it extremely ridiculous. Even for $40, it’s not worth it. $25 for 18 would be fair for this place. Trash everywhere. People included. Don’t waste your money or time. Go somewhere else!!!"
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"So, I shot so-so again."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"The way they had the course is exactly how it needs to be. Fairways clipped short leading up to the greens rewarding the golfers who stay in the fairway.Then, The Rough on the side."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,The greens are good. Some narrow fairways.Challenging holes on some. Easy holes on some.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,The staff was friendly. Thank you for an enjoyable day.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,greens had been cut and pressed and rolled nicely. fairways in good shape although 17th fairway and rough needed mowing. played in 2 hr. 40 min. Only drawback was no water coolers on course and hopefully will appear as it gets hotter.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,We always have a great time playing here. If you get a chance you must come here. This is a wonderful course and the staff is amazing too
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"This was my first trip over to the course. Toughest hole was a Par 3 over a lake playing back into the wind a bit. Played 194 yards which for me is normal choke down 5 iron or full 6. Most holes were under 500 yards. Which requires you to be accurate. It’s a Parkland layout. So if you can’t control your ball, you will need to stock up prior to play. I liked the greens. Overall, it was a fun relaxing place to play. Only downfall is the same old thing, other golfers pace. We all love the game and we flock to the courses. So we slow down ourselves because of it. Some tee boxes were soft. And the overall ground was just field. But it is a golf course to be fair and a divot can be had without breaking a club or your wrists. I liked it and will play there again."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,ProsLady in pro shop very niceGreen speed and smoothnessOverall great price at 20$ConsCourse little firm but good if in fairwaysTough to figure shots to front pinsBunkers poorFairways little sparse of grass
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Great round of golf. The greens are excellent. Everything is good.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Very challenging for short yardage. The only thing that was disappointing was the bunkers. Natural sand for the area but turns to concrete after a rain. Other than that we loved the place. Peaceful and quite. Will definitely be back.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Love this course. The greens need some work but overall a great experience.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,The course was in amazing shape after a long hard winter. I would recommend playing here. It has many risk reward holes.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"I love this course. It is March and the course is in good condition. Greens have been mowed at least once. This is a great country course. A great place to develop different parts of your game. A good variety of holes allows the golfer to use all the clubs in the bag. Enjoyable round, as usual."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Friendly owners. Friendly golfers.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,heat. were decent speed and rolled well. fairways showing some stress due to heat. glad to see some aeration being done in selected areas.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,greens and fringe areas were in good shape. fairways were OK but showed stress of extended heat.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Fairways & greens were nice . Second cut just as it should be .
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Played this course maybe 6 or 7 times so far this year. It is becoming my favorite course. No complaints today (other than leaving putts short). I like everything about it.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"I play this course about once per year when I am visiting friends in the area. Course has lots of trees lining fairways, most of which I have hit or landed directly behind, over the years. Course was freshly mowed this morning; guessing the fairways are bluegrass or similar. Greens were in great shape this year. Staff is super friendly! Had some big rains in past couple of days, but course handled it well with only a few puddles in low spots, and some in the cups. Staff was spraying greens in the middle of the day, which was concerning, not knowing if it was fertilizer or herbicide. I will be back next year. Give it a try. Pricing is good."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,This course is in great shape today. Greens are excellent. Great fairway and rough lengths. Teeboxes are perfect. Great course.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,The course is in great condition. If only my fairway shots were. The greens are good. Tee boxes are excellent. Great country course.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,I happened to find this course using this app. So glad we did. The course was overall in good shape. The staff was very friendly. And the layout of the course made you think about your shots before you hit them. It was challenging but any level players can play. Trees lined the fairways but they keep the ground clear so you can still find your balls and hit out. I definitely would recommend this course.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Perfect Autumn beauty course that falling red and yellow leaves and breeze. I was happy to play seeing and feeling nature.Unfortunately, it was crowed and some team was slow play so you need have a plenty of time comparing with normal season."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Another fine round of golf at Eagle Pines. A challenging and fun course. Greens are excellent but I can't putt. Tee boxes are acceptable. Crews are working. I have no complaints.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Great course. Many holes require a straight drive because of narrow fairways. The trees are the main hazard, so ball control is a must. I love this course. It sharpens my skills with accuracy. Greens are good. Tee boxes are good. Friendly staff, friendly golfers. Shot it maybe 6 times this year. 6 times had a good time. I play Fluff also, to some degree, and I recommend it for enjoyment of your game."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Great course. No rain in 6 weeks so things are dry and such. We all had a great time.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"I golf at Eagle Pines at least 3 times a year. I only golf here however when I can get a hot deal around $30. I am the type of golfer that never golfs at the same place two weeks in a row. So I see my fair share of courses around the central counties of the state. I am no golf course manager and will never claim that I know it all. But looking at everything the course has to offer or doesn’t offer in comparison to other courses. I will never understand why this course costs as much full price as many nicer courses within 25 miles of it. I know it is my choice whether or not to play here and I do enjoy the wooded challenge of the course, just never understood the cost. Fairways and rough are always cut nicely but greens always have many dead spots and are over watered."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Course fairways and greens very hardcould not land a ball on greens to havehold.Fairways very hard as wellStaff gave 18 hole rain check which theydidn’t have to do.Overpriced at 37 dollars for layout andcondition
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Throughout high school I played Eagle Pines multiple times a month and loved it. As a beginning golfer I loved the open-ness of many holes, but even the ability to get back on your fairway from another without much trouble following an errant tee shot. After getting older and playing tougher courses it was good to come back and see the course as I remembered. Pretty good shape, lots of birdies are possible with the flat greens, although the greens are a bit smaller than the greens at other courses. Water poses a challenge on a couple of holes, it was great to be back. Hope to be back soon!"
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,I played twilight with a friend it was still daylight and I was told we had to quit playing golf . I asked for some of my money back was told no but it was still daylight . I would not play nor recommend this course to anyone tge way we were treated .
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,This is a course we have played before a few times. Employees are always very friendly and welcoming. Unfortunately the area has had lots of rain and quite a few holes have standing water. This made play a bit tough. There were some cart path restrictions on certain holes; might have been best to make all holes the same to avoid further damage to course. Will certainly be back to play Eagle Pines.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,ProsCourse to our selfGreens would be great for any time of yearSmooth and consistent speedTees and fairways goodConsCarts on pathsCourse really wetTraps need played as ground under repair
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Very friendly staff but not familiar with course details. Very inconsistent course conditions. Open/forgiving with some challenging spots. One and done due to course condition.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Nothing special at this course, but it’s cheap, the people are great, and no crowds. Front nine is at straight forward as it gets, the back has a couple tough holes."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Always injoy this course it is in great shape after 10”snow melt.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"From the time we walked in the clubhouse and were greeted by the amazingly friendly woman, until when we left, our experience was fantastic. The other golfers we encountered were friendly, even the course kitty cat was friendly too."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"If you get a chance to play here, you have to !"
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,I book early tee times to ensure I don’t have anyone in front of me since I play fast. This course let a large group of senior golfers do a shotgun start after I made the turn and they were in my way the whole back 9. I finally quit after Hole 15 because I was so irritated that they were acting like they were doing me a favor by letting me play through! What’s the point of making an early tee time if a golf course is gonna let big groups out ahead of you? No mention of any outings or men’s league when I started.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"This was a nice course. We had an absolutely great time, which is most important. The course was great. I would definitely recommend playing here!"
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,The course was very well kept. I got stuck behind a mens league but I just skipped the holes and went back. Course was very nice and I will recommend to people and definitely be back.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Eagle Pines is a decent older course. Several tight tee shots can be found through narrow windows of trees, that perhaps could use a little trimming (especially 13, a par 3 that requires a slice short iron/wedge from the blue tees around the overhang). It was in firm shape throughout despite recent rain, though there was some evidence here and there of water damage. It's not a long course, so you can put away the driver if you're prone to spray. The holes looked like they haven't been moved in a while given the condition of the lips, but the greens rolled at a decent pace. Sand was a bit thin and pounded down, no rakes to be found when I went in. Water here and there was mostly pond scum."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Overall you can do better, but you can do worse too. It'd be a solid course for beginners or walkers as it's pretty flat. Just wear sleeves - it's apparently a problem there as 2 signs remind you of the requirement."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Not going to lie, we meant to book 'Eagle Creek Pines' but got this course instead. It's a very scenic course, with lots of tree's and no residential houses in sight. Don't expect perfect quality on the greens, bunkers, or even water hazards, but for the price we paid and the beautiful scenic course, it was worth it. Some holes the farrow was pretty narrow, having me use my 3-wood to be safe. You won't find many bunkers along the path to the pin at this course either, pretty much straight shot fairway to pin every hole."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Don’t blow off greens! Clumps of dead grass everywhere! Sand traps are HORRIBLE!! Glad I only paid $11.00 hot deal. Going to Martinsville Golf Club from now on!! That course is TOP NOTCH
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Overall course is nice. Sand traps are HORRIBLE and have been for years! Super needs to address this. Still a lot of leaves all over course (been to other courses this year and hardly any leaves). Overall greens are nice. A few have some rough spots but still very playable. Overall nice course to play, especially with Hot Deal."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Golf course is in good shape after a long Cool winter looking forward to spring Golf here
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Wintertime Garth is the best at this courseGood place to go and play golf he keep your swing up tIn winter
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,This course may not be long but certainly has it’s challenging holes. It is in pretty good shape considering all of the various types of weather we have had this year. Enjoyable round of golf
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"In spite of all the spring rain, the Maintenance staff of Eagle Pines has managed to get all the grass mowed when other local courses have struggled to keep up. The golf course was in excellent condition and very playable. We had a really good time as pace of play and weather were almost perfect. It was like finally spring time golf as it should be. I would and have recommended Eagle Pines to friends and associates. My hat is off to the Maintenance staff. What a herculean effort to have the entire course mowed and greens tended while up against one of the wettest springs ever."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"This is a great, affordable course that the ownership does a great job of maintaining."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,This is a very nice course to play I always enjoyed playing this course it is in very good shape right now the fairways were coming back I recommend this course to play with anybody recommend I recommend
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"My brother and I got a hot deal thru Golfnow and decided to come play Eagle Pines. We have played there many times but not in few months. Course was in really good condition, there was a few fairways being reseeded but very playable. Highly recommend playing here."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Golfed with friends had a great day, staff very friendly."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Course is in good shape. Fairways, tee boxes, and greens are maintained. All was freshly mowed. Greens were fairly slow and cut to be somewhat thick.Was very hot, so not many players out that afternoon making for comfortable place of play.Don't expect much with food and drink selections as it's a small clubhouse. My sandwich was good and there is enough for some basic choices.Always enjoy playing a round here."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,We decided to play at noon on Wed 6-6-18. I looked on GolfNow and there were 2 T-Times open for 1pm. I made the reservation and we headed to Mooresville from Plainfield and got t here just in time to t-off. We had a really great time the course was in really good shape for as dry as it has been this year. Very friendly staff and good concessions with free refills which really helps in a hot day! I highly recommend Eagle Pines to an golfer.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,New grass in fair ways it was injoy able my hat off to the superintend greens great shape sand in Bunkers I will play this course many times this year.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"I found this course on Golfnow.com. What a great experience! Maggie in the Pro Shop made us feel welcome. For late October, the course was in fantastic conditions...greens, fairways, tee boxes. You name it, excellent. Fair price, outstanding value. Highly recommended!"
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Very nice course to play. Greens was a little slow but in good shape. Well worth the money!
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,I really like this course however..2 thursdays in a row they did not have water in any of their 4 water coolers. I played between 12pm & 4pm. No excuse for that !!
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"It is a fun,friendly and challenging course that i enjoy playing."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,This course is a nice course it is a lot of fun and challenging the ball rolled out very well I have had a rain fairways were in great condition the course to play
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Staff was very friendly. It is a quirky, short short course that was enjoyable. Local knowledge would be very helpful. It was a windy day but holes always seemed to play shorter than yardage marked. There were quite a few dead areas, and greens were somewhat shaggy. It was enjoyable, and a value as a hot deal."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,This course is a very nice horse they're really making it a nice place to play golf I recommend it to anyone though go play at sea for yourself
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Course was in good condition. Shorter course and perfect for me as a bogey golfer. Will play again.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,This course was in good shape the layout was nice and the staff was very nice. I will definitely be back.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,The course's layout is prefect for ever golfers game. Gives you a challenge on every hole. Really a nice well maintained course for your money.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"This course is fun to play but.....they need rangers! There were two groups of two in front of us and the wait time on the tees was never less than 15 to 20 minutes. This is always the slowest play course I have ever seen. Staff is great, members rude."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,nice course and well maintained - average difficulty - good pace of play for a holiday
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,The course was in great condition. The fairways and greens were beautiful. The staff is always friendly. This has become our favorite course west of Indy.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Great round of golf! Excellent course. Very good value.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Haven't played this course for a couple years and purchased a ""Hot Deal"" round through GolfNow. Was in relatively good shape for early Spring and wet. Tee box markers would have been nice. Yardage display readout in cart was a plus. Not a lot of people out in a mid week afternoon which made for an easy going pace."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Fun smaller country course. Nicely maintained. It's not a championship layout but good place to play a casual round with friends and family. We got a nice deal on Golfnow:)
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Had a very nice time playing this course. Had some challenging holes and the greens were in great shape for this time of year. I will be coming back.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Enjoy playing the course very very very much this time around is getting a little bit cooler and the grass is really starting to come back
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Based on the reviews I chose this course to play. When I saw that it was in the top 20 Indiana courses for 2015, it got my attention. I was anticipating a more picturesque clubhouse, driving range, course ranger, etc. Don't get me wrong, it is a nice course that I would play again, but it should not be the #8 best course in Indiana. The clubhouse is very small, and that's ok. Chipping and putting area is good, as were the fairways and greens. GPS in carts had ""just the basic GPS yards to the center of the green"", no hole layout, etc. That's ok as well, probably a step up from similar type courses. Staff was friendly. A good experience overall, but just not a top 20 type course."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"I played Eagle Pines today and the course condition is excellent. I've played here 5 times now this year, and I've never been disappointed. The greens are always fast and well taken care of, and the fairways and tee boxes are in great shape right now, which is more than you can say for most courses."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"I found all of the staff to be very friendly and helpful. They even provided me a book on the course since I was a first time player. A nice plus was if you buy a fountain drink you get free refills,The eighteenth hole is a forced carry to a tight green so good luck,"
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Eagle Pines is a beautiful setting with a great layout. The course is great for the seasoned as well as the beginning golfer.I would highly recommend playing here if you are from out-of-town looking for a good course with no waiting.The staff is very friendly and helpful.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"If I lived closer, I would play here more often. Of course, part of the charm is that it is distant from my city home, so you hear birds and breeze instead of traffic."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Course is laid out nice, Seems to hold water though.Food is good and friendly staff."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"First time playing based on recommendation by a friend. Couldn't pass on it with a GolfNow deal special for $10 for 18 with a cart! Overall the course was in fair shape. It had rained alot the previous day (and week for that matter) so the course was soggy and it was ""cart path only"" but pace of play was surprisingly good. I thought the layout of the course was very good with some very vanilla holes with no real challenge coupled with some pretty difficult holes with several water hazards to avoid. I will definitely play this course again as it was alot of fun to play and the staff was very personable and friendly!"
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Very good course layout. Small greens and very good conditions. Lots of challenging holes especially no.18. Staff was super friendly. I really like this course !
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Very well kept course. Best bang for my buck any day.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"First time playing here,it was early in the golf season so it was a little wet,some holes were cart path only. I didn't play well but would go back. I liked the layout. It was early golf season so they didn't have the hole signs up yet so I didn't know which hole was next not their fault. My only complaint is they wanted to charge us for my girlfriend who doesn't even play, SD he just drives the cart.. Why?"
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,A hidden Gem with the best owners and staff in Central Indiana! Course is always in great shape and well maintained. Lunch specials are very good too!
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Very nice course, will play again.Tee boxes in good shape,Green are good,fairways play nice.good layout, will return."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,My daughter and I love playing at this course. The course is beautiful and the grounds are so well kept. The staff is amazing and extremely helpful.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"This is the 4th time I've played eagle pines this season, and it remains one of the best courses on the southside of Indy. The fairways, tee boxes and greens are all in excellent shape for this time of year, especially compared to most other courses where burned-out grass is common right now."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Great course layout! The staff members are always friendly including a couple dogs that roam the course. Not a horribly long course, but 15-18 is an excellent finish. There is no driving range, but there is a pitching area that gives you about 50 yards to work with. Check out the $40 all day rate!"
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,The course was nice. The only problem that I had was a group with 5 people in it playing in front of me. Could have gone a lot faster had that group not been holding up the pace. The course is spaced out well and not to narrow. I also like that they have the gps for yardage
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,This was my first time playing this course and I really enjoyed it. Some of the holes are more challenging then they appear to be. I will be playing this course again
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Amazing. This course plays very well & exceptionally impressed with the fairway conditions. Thank you Eagle Pines
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,This course is great for families. It was in great shape and the green were more challenging than they look.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Short but good for higher handicapper. Some challenging holes, some easy. Enjoyed the experience. Worth the drive. Good value."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"We have played here 3 times so far in 2015. Greens have been pretty fast, tee boxes are lush, and fairways are in nice shape. Shot shaping is required off the tee or you will get abused. Greens are small on all except for a few holes."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Very nice course and challenging. Had a great day.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"This was a excellent course to visit and play. TheStaff was excellent, course manicured, greens fast,and play for 18 holes was under 4 hrs. I reallyenjoyed playing, and definitely will return."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"I live within 10 minutes of this course but I had never made it over to play a round, until yesterday. I had a great time and there was no in front of me or behind me. Its a fun course and I will definitely be back again this season."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"For the time of year, this course was in great shape!"
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Greens just airatedHad great weather course great with good friendsclub house very friendly,what else can you ask for"
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,THANKS
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Don't think anyone would be disappointed playing this course.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Wonderfull golf course. A couple of really challenging holes. Water water everywhere .... bring a few extra balls along !! I'll play this again !!!
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,I live very close so I play here all the time & just genuinely love this course.It has both easy holes and some not so easy holes which makes it interesting to play.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Friendly staff and a well manicured course. It was a hot humid day and the mature trees throughout, helped with the heat. Open fairways welcomed my game and kept my anxiety to a minimum. The gps on the cart was an added bonus, we all loved it! Definitely going to play another round this year! !"
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"You better have control of your golf ball when playing here. It's not about distance, my friend. Fun course. Always enjoy playing here."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"I have been playing at Eagle Pines for well over one year and have never had a bad day there. It is family owned and operated and they allow you to play as a single when it's not crowded. The carts are really quick and have range finders, so you can play fast and work on your distances. If you get a good deal on Golfnow, you simply can't beat this course for value. I was reluctant to do a review because I don't want it to get overcrowded and slow, but it deserves some recognition."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,I enjoyed my round. Course was in pretty good shape and has a lot of variety. Tees are well marked
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Eagle Pines is the old Mooresville Country Club.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Greens are fast, but not lightning. Wish they were faster."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Played the back tees -- only 6200 yards -- but still challenging.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"I love these old Coutnry Club courses that were built in the 1920s and 1930s -- lots of doglegs, undulating greens."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Only 35 minutes from Blomington -- a true hidden gem -- have played here 4 times in the past 3 weeks.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Course is maintained well; staff courteous. Trees are plentiful. Make sure you plan your next shot.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Nice course, must place the ball in the right spot on a bunch of holes, Watch out for number 18."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Had not been to Eagle Pines for several years. Booked a 9 am time, went in at 8:50 am and paid behind others (several groups were already paid with bags on carts), and was told to go and get a cart. Drove up to hole 1 and there was no one there. Got out ahead of any other groups and never was pushed or waited during my play although there were lots of golfers on course."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Course was in great shape, with well manicured tee boxes, fairways, and greens. Tee shots wide of fairway or fairway shots wide of green can make you be creative on your next shot due to trees. Several doglegs and 2nd shots that must stay clear of trees on the way to the green make this a challenging course."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"I had been told about this course by friends and decided to finally play it. What a surprise! The course is pretty tight and not real long, but it was in very good condition. Very pretty landscaping and wooded. I would suggest playing a lesser club that you hit straight instead of one you may hook or slice because there is not alot of room for error. I am already looking forward to playing there again."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"This is a quaint little family owned course off the beaten path. It's always maintained fairly well and it's very easy. Par 4 holes probably average 340 from the white tees, so average golfers get a chance to hit lots of short irons into the greens. While it's not a big challenge for scratch golfers, it IS interesting and at many points...even picturesque."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Was in the area for business and wanted a nice course for a late afternoon/early evening round. This was almost perfect. Moderately challenging which worked well for working on a swing change. Extremely friendly staff - clubhouse, cart boys, etc. Only golf course to send me a thank you email for playing a round at their course. Only down side -- My tee time was for 5:00 and they had an evening league starting at 5:00. I was started on the back nine which is ok with me. Playing by myself, I finished the back nine in about 90 minutes and caught up to the end of the league on the second hole. They were very nice about pointing me to the back nine (which I already played). I was happy playing two balls and spending extra time practicing putting/chipping on each hole - I needed the practivce. It's always frustrating when a course takes your tee time but doesn't explain they have a league playing at the same time. It worked for me this time but under different circumstances, I would have wanted to know before I arrived for my tee time. Still - a very enjoyable time! I'd definitely play here again!"
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,This was a great course for the money very fun course. Daughters first time there and we had a great time. Everone was nice and friendly.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Always enjoy playing this course. It has holes that will always make you look good and deceptive holes that will eat your lunch. Course was in great shape. Greens were fast enough that they required some thought and finesse. You will be able to use just about every club in the bag. Carts were fully charged and had no problems making it around the entire course. Enjoyable round, already looking forward to going back!"
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Great for the money! Course is short but fun because of it.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Old style, tree lined course, that puts a premium on accuracy and course management. The tees, fairways, and greens are all in excellent shape. A little attention to the bunkers is needed in my opinion but for the money, it's a super value. It was our first time playing the course and have a tee time for 4 tomorrow already. Can't wait!!!!"
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,The course is in excellent shape. The staff was so friendly & helpful. Wish the course was closer to where I lived so I could play it more.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Great local course. Lots of shade for those hot summer days. Well maintained, although the rough is pretty rough. Great value."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Don't let the short yardages fool you, this is a challenging golf course."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Should be in great shape later in year,greens rolled better then expected for 3/15/2014- only cons 18th hole almost sure bogey,and bunkers will need sand and some work. Staff was great, from inside to cart people glad to see you ,could not have been nicer!!!!!"
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Course is not too long but challenging and in good shape.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Not aware the back 9 was down due to plugging and sanding the greens. Staff was super - Played the front 9 twice and then 15 - 18.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Staff very friendly and asked for comments on condition. You can see the work they've put into the course. Although not extremely long at 6100 yds from blues, this course has plenty of challenges. I will definitely go back."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Since it hadn't rained in a month, I was expecting the fairways and the greens to be in bad shape. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw how well the course has been cared for during the dry conditions. Even the Ladies tee boxes were well-watered!My golf partner decided to practice in the humid and hot temperatures before we played and a staff member quickly realized that she was over-heating. He brought her out a bottle of water and made sure she headed for the air-conditioning in the Club House before she passed out. Very thoughtful!"
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Fairways and Greens were very maintained. With the lack of water the course was in good condition.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Pace of play was very good as well as we accomplished 18 holes in just over 4 hours.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"For the money, it can't be beat. The course does all of the little things that other courses at the same price does not. GPS in the cart for one example, and well maintained tee boxes too."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"great course litle too far from my house, but is a good and well maintainedcourse"
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,we started out cart path only but after 9 we where able to drive in the fairways.i would recommend this course to anyone
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,great condition although greens were a little slow.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"This course has a lot of character with nice greens and fairways. Some fairways are tight demanding exact shots and ball placement. The staff was very friendly and the carts were in good condition with GPS capability. The only negative is they allow 5-somes and 6-somes. We were a 2-some and played the front 9 very quickly. When we made the turn, we were behind another 2-some walking with pull carts. Not a problems as they usually play as fast as a 2-some in a cart, except they were waiting on every shot. Come to find out, they had a 5-some in front of them. They asked us to join them and they were a very nice, local couple. We still had to wait on the 5-some on every shot. The PGA is encouraging fast play, but 5-somes and 6-somes (we saw a 6-some) does not allow for this. I would play this course again only if I was sure that there were not any 5 or 6 somes already on the course. This course needs to get with the PGA program to encourage faster play."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Course was well maintained. Flag placement was difficult on some holes. Very clean facilities.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"I was very unimpressed with this course. It is fairly straight forward, fairways are about as tall as the rough, and the greens are tiny and flat. I will not be back to play this one. I'm feeling a little cheated for the Hot Deal price I paid. If you read these reviews and are thinking of playing this course trust me when I say it is not worth it. You can find much better courses on GolfNow for the same as this disappointment of a course. Just don't waste your time with this one."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,The course is not real long but plays longer than it is. Some shots are tight which makes it a challenge. Great deal!
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,The course was in good shape and improvements were being made. The clubhouse staff were extremely friendly. I would definetly go back.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Well kept little secret just minutes south of the Indianapolis International Airport (a stone's throw from Gray's Cafe). Very nice staff. Course in really good condition. Greens are definitely a challenge, depending upon the pin placement."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,We really enjoyed our round there. The staff and course was great. I plan to book times there in future.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"This Course has fast Greens and Nice fairways.. The carts are kept in good condition an have the shout distance display that work great... The Staff are very nice and friendly. The pace of golf here was the way it should be.. Try this course , you will have a Great time...."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"Their motto is that they are Indy's hidden little gem. If you haven't played this course, give it a shot, you'll enjoy it."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,I glad Eagle Pines is now part of Golf Now. I like this course and now I can get Golf Now prices.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,Overall a Very nice course. Very well laid out with mature trees and lots of landscaping flower gardens.
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"This is an older course just outside of Mooresville, IN. It can be a tricky one to find, but any local will be more than accomodating. The staff was very nice, and the course was in good shape... greens looked a bit shaggy, but they weren't! While they weren't ""US Open"" fast, they rolled as true as anywhere else I've played. After lots of rain over the past several day... the course drained increidbly well. If you've never played it, then it's a must... A true gem, hidden away."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,"EAGLE CREEK PINES IS A NICE AND COMPETITIVE COURSE, BUT THE HAVE BEEN MAINTAINING THE COURSE AS THEY HAVE IN THE PAST."
Eagle Pines Golf Club,5880-eagle-pines-golf-club,The corse was in great shape. Staff was very nice and helpful. Carts have gps some very neat and challenging holes. Nice little gem in southern Indiana
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,I’m an old Hoosier who is temporarily back home due to my wife’s medical treatments. Staying with our daughter in Fishers Gray Eagle is 4 miles from her home.I booked the tee time on GolfNow for $33. Course is in great shape and challenging. As a Senior (74) I played a combo of White & Green tees; White on par 4 & 3’s & Green on par 5’s. Had a good round & really like the track.Went back today & had Randy regrip my clubs. He was very nice & a pleasure to talk golf with.Will definitely recommend GE to my Indy golf buddies & will be back soon.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Not much to say. I haven’t played this course in years and nothing’s changed. Weeds are out of. Control. Doesn’t look like they’re taking care of the course.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Fairways were ok. Tee boxes were disappointing. Some greens were good others were just ok. Weeds were everywhere on the course. Weeds combined with rough that needed cutting badly made it tough to find your ball even if it just rolled off the fairway. The course needs attention. I hadn’t played there for 20 years and it was just like it was then. I most likely won’t play there again. Not a real bargain for the cost.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"We set up out tee time for 840am. The weather was absolutely gorgeous so we decided to walk. Had we known that hole 1 was a 10-15 min walk around the entire driving range, and the holes were very spaced out we would not have. Neither the clubhouse staff or starter mentioned the distance. Also, since apparently they flipped the front and back nines, the course was not marked very well to the next hole. Got lost once and a group ahead of us helped us out. They did the same thing. Other than that the course was nice and challenging. I will play again, but will not make the mistake of walking."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Gentleman working desk tried to tell me that Golf Now showed I hadn’t paidHad to show him my phone confirmation and. He still acted put off
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,At check in I discovered the senior rate was less than the Golfnow deal.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,They put zero effort or money in to course maintenance.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Hole #7 may be the worst golf hole in the state. It’s a par 4 about 370 yards dogleg right. There is a tree on the corner of the dogleg. You MUST be left if the tree. Must hit a 220 tee shot to a 20yard area to have shot at green. Then…there is another giant tree over hanging the fairway on the approach shot. It’s a ridiculous hole. And that doesn’t include the bunkers…the creek cutting across the fairway and the most tricked up green on the course! Other holes are almost as bad. Then some holes are easy. It makes for a silly layout that isn’t much fun to play.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Very disappointing had to play 18 holes in the 90 degree heat with no water to drink on the course.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Value was good. Course is in good condition, and I like the layout. Mixture of long approach shots with some that are short irons."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Very nice course, will definitely play again. Great value. Tough but fair holes throughout. Fantastic practice area"
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Rained last night and through the early morning. The courses around were canceling times. Gray Eagle refused to cancel and refund.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,WILL NEVER GOLF THERE AGAIN!
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,First time here. Greens were real nice except for several ball marks people failed to fix. Fairways were also in nice shape. Not a hard layout. Fairly easy to score even being unfamiliar with course. Luckily didn’t hit the sand so can’t evaluate. I was a single. I caught the twosome ahead of me after the first couple of holes. Nice guys but never asked me to join them so I just waited behind d them on every hole. They offered to let me play through but there was a threesome in front of them and then a couple of foursomes so no place to go. Front group was slow and there wasn’t any Marshall to monitor. Took us five hours. That is only complaint. Would play again hopefully with less traffic or better pace.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Had a 930 tee time. No starter to pair people up so bunch of twosomes going off. Round was very slow. Course was very soft and wet but it hasnt really rained much. Course doesnt drain well either. Bunkers were mostly mud and greens were slow and had a ton of pitch marks. Overall a ok course but not worth the $60 they want to charge.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Course was in decent shape, considering it is late summer. Pace of play was good. We will return."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"I have played this course quite a few times and I still find it fun, challenging and pleasant to play! I have played other courses in the vicinity and almost always find myself drawn back to this one. The course layout was recently flipped in preparation for the new clubhouse setup and I absolutely love it!While others may criticize the course, the greens are in almost pristine condition, fairways above average and if patrons would actually take care of their divots and respect the course when they play, this course would be in way better shape!My only criticism would be the lack of water stations as you play through. Please bring those back!!"
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Greens challenging but not too difficult.Lots of places to lose balls on this course, especially if your woods and long Irons are off that day. Lots of fescue, tall grass around boundaries and water. A few holes on the back 9 are tree-lined.The Greens are in good shape, fairways are decent, one or two Tee boxes were in rough shape especially the 4th par 5 Whites tees.Grounds could be better taken care of, (damage to the ground in a couple spots made by the mower wasn't repaired) the bunkers werent soft, one had standing water even though it hadn't rained for a few days.There are 5 Par 5s, including hole #1, with 3 coming on the Back 9.There are homes on this course, but it is well designed so only the most horrible of shots go into yards. I lost the most balls (and found) I have all this year, yet none of them got lost in a homeowners yard.There is talk the owner wanted to sell but the community talked him out of it. It shows in places, which is a bummer because it's a nicely designed course."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,The person we checked in with was not friendly at all! Corse was is pretty good condition.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"I really enjoyed my time at Gray Eagle, and found the course to be very forgiving. My only gripe was that some areas were not well maintained -- particularly bunkers, which often had standing water/no drainage, and at least one green had an entire area that was missing grass/unplayable. I understand it takes a lot of money to run a course, so overall, I have no complaints and felt it was a good value. Pace of play was pretty typical - 2.5 hours for 9 holes in a cart, due to slow foursomes in front of two somes. I wish tee times were 15 minutes apart, rather than 10, but it is what it is."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Thanks for welcoming us out to the course!
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,I made a tee time on Fathers Day for my wife daughter and me.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,I show up 5 minutes before my tee time and prepaid. They tell me they added 3 people learning my wife and daughter are just playing a little bit. I ask instead can I just get a bucket of balls and still say no.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,I spend $100 to have a nice round with my family and the course staff basically said I couldn’t do that and took my money. Will never again play here and will do my best to let other people know this type of staff behavior goes on
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Construction confusion…rough was tough..back and front nine flipped..some holes need better arrows to next hole..I think once they get new club house built and do some work on course things will be better..the course has some challenge!
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"played on 6/22/23. They changed 9's this year and I like the new set up. t boxes need improvement, fairways pretty good shape, sand not in good shape, greens not bad but players need to fix divots! overall fun day with good pricing compared to other courses,"
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"One of the worst courses in Hamilton County. The layout isn’t great, they don’t take care of the course well. They overcharge for everything. Who pays $17 for a bucket of balls? $17 dollars?! well just about every other course in Hampton County is well-maintained, the owners of this course are pocketing every penny they possibly can because it’s not going back into the course maintenance. For $60 on a weekend, there’s dozens of courses in Hamilton County that is a better value. The greens are some of the worst you’ll play in Hamilton county. They have ridiculous undulations that scream “I didn’t put any thought into the design of this course at all“. The tea boxes are uneven everywhere, and look worse than a used driving range. Simply put, this course over charges, and they put no money back into it."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Half way house not open when making the turn. Very disappointing. You need to tell customers before they arrive at the course so they can prepare. No food or drink for 4 hours is hard to handle.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Tee boxes not in great shape. One tee box, was laughable that tee position was on a foot slope. Obviously, I can move back some, but just a lack for detail."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Friendly staff, good price and the course is always in great condition. One of my favorite courses in Indy."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"The course could be nice. The layout is decent but the grounds keeper doesn’t seem to have much pride in his work. Some bunkers are filled with rock. Clumps of grass on the fairway. No drinking water on the course and the halfway house was closed (temperature expected to be in the mid 90’s). Ball cleaners are either dry or full of mud. Many of the washers don’t have towels and the ones that do are shredded. Cross the dilapidated bridges at your own peril.I take no pleasure in this review because I live in Gray Eagle. The potential is there but until the grounds keeper becomes more interested in maintaining the property than being the security guard (long story) I’ll be going to Stoney Creek. It’s in much better shape, cheaper and a very friendly staff."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Greens have vastly improved over the years and are in great conditions. Only negative was the “sand” in the traps…need to be raked in morning and real sand to replay whatever they have in them. Overall, the course is pretty darn tough and definitely worth the money. Can’t wait for the new clubhouse to be built."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Enjoyed the course w it’s varied hole layouts. Will okay it again.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Great staff, always smiling. Course in good shape early, price is perfect. Even tho it’s under construction, still a great Course. Love GE"
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Course was not in good shape. Tee boxes are in terrible shape. No distances marked. Cart path only made club selection challenging. I won’t be going back.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"This is a pretty nice layout in a convenient location in Fishers. Do not walk this course. Everything is very spread out through a subdivision and the first and tenth tees are a long par 5 away from the clubhouse. The halfway house is rarely open. If you can deal with that, It's a pretty fun and challenging course. Great practice areas too."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,The course was in pretty good shape considering the lack of rain. Bunkers need some attention and new sand. Hole 16 is unfair. It could be a decent hole with some renovation. You shouldn't be blocked out by trees in the middle of the fairway. Extend the fairway or trim back that Birch(?) tree.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,This course could be great if they actually invested in it. The tee boxes were terrible and the greens were hit or miss.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"The good news is the course was in good shape. But the odd layout, lack of even a water cooler on the course on an 85 degree day (you don’t return to clubhouse between 9s so it was a slog) and a round that was 4:26 made for a rough day."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"A ranger, water cooler or beverage cart or even being told at check-in could have improved things a LOT! But alas- there are too many other and better courses to return to this one."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Tee boxes are awful (many overrun by crabgrass and clover) and the heather is ridiculously thick for a public course of this caliber. Will not spend my money here again.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Narrow course that offers a fun round. Heavy par 5s a few short 4s but overall fun experience
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"areas of the course were so dry you would think the grass was dead. first five greens were hard as the parking lot, then others were clearly over watered as my approach shots plugged on the green and there was standing water on the fringes. then they got hard again, and then muddy to finish. the dominate vegetation in the rough is clover, and there is virtually no grass on tee boxes on some holes ( white) while other boxes were pristine Move the markers!"
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"If you’re unable to get on another course,, a good round can be found here.The staff isn’t overly friendly and the amenities are at a bare minimum but the course is in pretty gods shape"
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"The overall course was truly amazing offering different challenges of water, some narrow fairways, bunkers, and trees. The play was challenging but not overbearing. The greens played at a very nice tempo, however, the greens were beaten with pitch marks. The biggest overall experience was that every green was scarred with pitch marks all over and around the holes. The course has signs posted to “fix your pitch mark and one more” at the clubhouse, but it would almost seem no one does so."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Course in rough shape. Greens patchy and with grass missing. Bunkers mostly unplayable.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Staff seems unhappy to be there. Very Melancholy Environment. Plenty of other options for the prices they ask for during weekend play in my opinion.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Long time Fishers resident and I’ll likely play anywhere else unless shown that some care is being given to this course and to the personnel to represent it.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Overall it’s what I expected from Gray Eagle but not enough to us today their weekend rates for the course to be in as rough of shape as it was. Greens were missing grass in patches. Bunkers submerged in water, no drainage in places. I only booked and was able to get on for under $30 which is about what this course should go for. Staffing is likely an issue so this review may not be the case under ideal staffing conditions."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,This is one of my favorite golf courses in the Fisher’s area
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,The tee boxes are quite rough and the greens could use some love but the price is right and everyone is nice.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Course is a very well maintained course considering it’s public and sees a lot of action. Greens were 8/10 condition overall, no major issues at all besides a line of dead grass on green #2 that I can remember."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Offers some fun, challenging holes for all handicaps with a good amount of water/bunker hazards and OB in play on most holes."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Massive club house with indoor driving range bays, putting lesson area, and a large room for club fitting/customizations.Outdoor driving range from mats and grass paired with 2 large chipping greens and a unique putting green for practice."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Highly recommend for anyone in the area!
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Best course I have played since moving to Indianapolis.Staff were very nice also.I will be back
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Every golfer meet at other courses mention that Gray Eagle is overpriced, especially for the condition it's been in for several years. I really tried to give it a chance and played here a dozen times in the last two years. I enjoy the course layout as a good mix between fun and course management. Unfortunately, the poor course conditions, price, and staff drove me away."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"I recently had the second tee time of the day as a single with another single ahead of me. There were literally 3 cars in the parking lot, but the staff insisted that I pair up with another group. I told them it was my birthday and I just wanted to play a quick round. The staff wouldn't budge saying they were fully booked and I'd just clog things up. Apparently solo golfers ahead of threesomes and foursomes slows the pace somehow? That's not how golf works."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"The other players didn't show up, so I played alone and finished the full 18 holes under par in 2 hours and 15 minutes. I decided that would be the last round I play at Gray Eagle. By the way, their definition of ""fully booked"" is 25 cars in the parking lot (including 10 people on the range/greens) at 10:30 on a Sunday."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"I have played this course 3 times this year and I’ve enjoyed playing it every time out. This morning I woke up before my tee time to call and ask how course conditions were. I did this prior to my tee time, since we had some unexpected rain today. They told me the course was fine over the phone so I made my way out to the course to attempt to get my round in. After playing the first 5 holes the weather didn’t hold up and the course became extremely sloppy and unplayable. The course was even a little sloppy from the first tee box so I was misinformed over the phone. After waiting at hole 6 for 30 minutes of a hard downpour the course was covered in puddles. We then drove to the clubhouse to find we were 1 of 3 cars left in the parking lot since the rain chased everyone off. We went in to get a rain check, but now we have to pay for 9 holes to get the other 9 holes free (that we already paid for when we booked the 18) via the rain check. I asked the gentleman working why I would have to purchase an additional 9 to get 9 and finish my round another day? He then said I was choosing to forgo my round and that the course was still playable. The city had just issued a flash flood warning yet the course was still playable? I explained to him that the greens had puddles and the ball was plugging every time your ball landed. I also asked if I could buy 18 and get a free 9 to play 27 that day? Again he said no. He did not want to hear it and walked to help another guest. This was very poor customer service and they have a very bad policy for rain checks. Even though I really enjoy playing the course, I will unfortunately not play this course every again."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Perfect conditions to play on Monday 8/2 at 10am. Starter had us all go off on #10. First nine, was okay, had to wait on some tee boxes, but this is expected, and no long waits. However, at the turn, they had other groups starting their round on #1 as we made the turn. There were 2 new foursomes that just appeared on #1 in front of us. Then we waited about 5-10 minutes on EVERY hole. This turned a 3 1/2 round into 4 hours and 50 minutes. For the $55 price tag, this is unacceptable. Someone did not do their job on this one. One good note - the half-way house brats and burgers were great!!"
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"The course was in rough condition and was not a great value for the cost. I would not have cared as much if it had not been for the extremely aggravating carts. Any time you came within 10 feet of a tee box, body of water or green the cart would shut off completely and you would have to push it outside of range to start back up. For anyone who is not fit or older, I would not come here. We were not warned of this beforehand and saw multiple groups also having to push their carts to get them started again. Overall, an absolute pain to play here."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Haven’t played here in a few years. Nice staff and the potential for this course is there for sure. Very scenic with diverse landscape and challenges so the layout makes it enjoyable. Nevertheless, I feel they charge too much given the poor conditions. Greens and tee boxes are in really rough shape - it even close to being decent. Many areas seem soggy or unkept. If you don’t know this course already good luck - there are several places with forks in the cart path and no signage. It would be very simple to buy a few signs to show people where to turn. Also they need to invest in waste baskets as most holes don’t have them installed. Finally, the carts have sensors to keep you on the path but there appear to be issues. For example, hole 13 is a par three and you cannot even leave the path yet the cart beeped at is the whole way while in the path. This happened elsewhere too."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"I always enjoy playing here, but the clubhouse is entirely too far from the rest of the course. Going back to refill your cooler, buy food or balls, or go to the bathroom at the turn is not a reasonable option at this course. Way too far. Always makes me want to sneak my own drinks onto the course which puts me in an uncomfortable position if i were caught. There is a small concession stand type building at the turn, but it is rarely ever open when i play. I would play here much more frequently if this weren’t an issue. Fantastic course otherwise. It is not possible to keep up the pace of play if you stop by the clubhouse at the turn. It is absolutely not an option if you are walking. I don’t know what the solution is, but it’s something that needs to be addressed for sure."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"My friend lives in South Indy and we live 2 hours SW, but we’re visiting family in Noblesville. I usually play there but we were wanting a good deal and it was between this Course and Pebble Brook and we texted each other that we would play there. Next thing I know I’m clicking on Grey Eagle. Since my friend hadn’t booked yet we decided to switch choices. Now I like this course better and will definitely go back."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"The course's land and scenery were great, however, the course was not in very good shape. Many tee boxes were torn up. The greens had numerous ball marks and other damage. The carts have some kind of monitoring device which shuts off the cart if you go someplace it does not want you to go, but there is no signage or any other means to tell where not to go. The course had not been mowed very recently so the rough (and even the fairways) were pretty tall. Course maintenance seems to be lacking."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"The course has potential, and even with some issues (with some tee boxes, a couple of greens), it's a good deal and the staff is great"
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"I've haven't played here in a few years because I remember how poor the conditions were. I used to play because of location and because of value. Nothing has changed, the course was poorly mowed, tee boxes were awful, and even though there was rain in the days prior they watered the heck out of the place. Greens had standing water, the fairways were puddle and the bunkers were ponds. How can they top $ for this course?"
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,I don’t typically write reviews but I feel ripped off after spending $60 to play here. Greens fees should be no more than $35 for a Saturday morning tee time given the condition of the course. Slowest greens east of the Mississippi.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"I’m a 13 handicap from the white tees.10 from the senior twos. This is an excellent and challenging course. It is a very fair course. Best to keep your drives in the fairway even if you have to sacrifice some distance. Hole 4 is a par 5. Don’t get greedy on this hole, club down and take your time. Too easy to hit your ball in the woods right and left. Hole #15 can be tricky. Hit as close to the tree on the right as you can. I hit my drivers 220-240. I club down and hit a safe three wood. If you hit left you are going down a ravine into the woods. A slicers nightmare. The next hole #16 is a challenge. You have to hit your drive almost to the sand trap at the end of the fairway in order to have any chance of hitting the green on your second shot. Their is a beautiful double Sycamore tree guarding the green if your drive is short. As much as I like those Sycamores I’m praying lighting hits this one and opens up the approach to the green."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,My wife and I enjoyed....some parts of the course facilities not in great shape....still winter or early spring condition
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Quirky (honestly a few terrible holes) course, cut through an upscale housing addition. Typical 90's penal design. Staff is great. Maintenance could be better, lots of crabgrass in rough and unkempt heather that eats golf balls. Greens are over watered and get tracked up easily. Huge driving range and practice area.Clubhouse looks like a cart shed that doesn't fit with the upscale area."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Greens are 6-7 ft on the stimp meter. Did an early aeration a month ago on the front and it hasn't helped. Even in mid season these greens are painfully slow. The rest of the course is decent-good. I'm a senior playing whites and I'm on the second or tips on a few holes.They put all three tees in the same spot on several holes. Some bunkers are practically sandless as well.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"The Gray Eagle layout is not bad. There are many nice holes including two especially challenging holes, among the best in the city. And props to the guy at the halfway house who was friendly and fast.But pace of play was slow, greens were shaggy, tees were more divots than grass and crabgrass is everywhere. One has to wonder how good this course would be if the owner just made an effort."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,The course was set up nicely and it was surprisingly wet ... but the greens were SUPER shaggy and slow. Need to be cut and rolled ASAP.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Played it yesterday and greens were in awful shape, like putting over potholes especially back nine wow! Looks like it’s been neglected for a year or so. Great layout and potential but tee boxes are mix of tall weeds and hard dirt spots. Disappointed especially for $48 ! Not worth $25."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,We played through golf now @ $47.50 each. The entire back nine greens and tee boxes were a wreck putting it nicely. Front nine tee boxes not great either. Like teeing off in the rough. I just couldn’t get over how awful the greens are .. divots is least of concerns. Our foursome was Very disappointed.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"I’ve lived in a home on the course for years. And I’ve played the course many times. The biggest issue they have is the average golfer not caring about the shape they leave the course Divots ALL OVER the place, and the course seems to do NOTHIBG to take care. And there are NO signs directing cart traffic, especially away from the greens. So golfers routinely drive right up to the greens, right behind the greens and right through the wet areas of the course. Signage is ABSOLUTELY needed. Two more Negative things to mention. The tee boxes are the worst I’ve seen anywhere as for finding a level area to tee up. And last, the facilities are severely lacking. You can’t charge $60+ and not upgrade facilities soon.The layout? Spectacular. Only one BS hole...#13 par 3 at 99 yards downhill. I shouldn’t have to hit my sand wedge on a tee box.Put some $ into the course by first hiring a Superintendent who knows how to fix the poor areas."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Have played this course several times over the last few years and its overall a good course. Today's round however was not one of my favorites. We played an early morning tee time in hopes to avoid the heat (that didnt work). No rain in the last 7 days, but the course was surprisingly soaked. Yes i can understand the morning dew and all that...but playing in the fairways with puddles of standing water...hitting from the fairway splashed mud and grit up in the air....and if you missed the fairway, you were likely to spend several minutes trying to locate your ball in ridiculously thick fescue, if you were able to find it at all. one other note was that the back nine greens had extremely large aeration marks...almost like a first timer was out there learning how to do it...the hole marks were literally bigger then then the golf pencil itself..making putting quite a challenge"
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,I have been playing this course for many years. This is the worst condition that it’s ever been in while also being the most expensive it’s ever been. Not a good correlation.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"They never move the tee off locations on the tee box, greens are in terrible shape, and the course is just overall in rough shape."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"They have been plenty busy to be able to put some money back into the course, but looks as if they just refuse to. This is always a last resort course for me. Drive over to Arrowhead in Greenfield for a course twice as nice and half the cost."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,I have played the course several times a year for many years. Greens were in super shape. Rolling smoothly at good pace. Par 5’s are fun to play. A couple of quirky holes but overall a good layout with variety.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Went to club’s website, immediately saw online tee times, and assumed that’s how i was to register. It let me book my tee time, however I had to 1) pay in advance for all 4 of us (never do this a other courses), 2) looked for appropriate “rate”, only $45 for 18 was available (assumed they had changed their fees), and 3) charged me a $10 (approx) booking fee! Had to change to threesome - called the course, told me I had to call the booking company. Called booking - can’t talk to a person - instructed I had to modify online.....went online, didn’t have an account, so couldn’t modify. Called booking back - chose “made reservation on Course’s website” - told to go online, search for “chat” button at bottom right - could not find it. Created an account to modify reservation - didn’t have my registration listed, wouldn’t allow me to input the registration number. Read “if you have any questions, send email to xxxxxx” - sent email, immediately rejected as invalid email. Called the course, told “huh, thats odd, just talk to the people when you come in”, also asked, can I call in or do i have to use the registration system - told need to use online, thats were the best deals are. Came in and was treated very professionally - gave me rain check for 1 green fee - when I asked about Senior fee ($29 not $45online), was can’t do that online, only the full fee - contradicts statement that “best deals are online”! And was told, nothing they can do to refund that. So I paid $74 more than I should have (although they refunded one green fee) - disappointed to say the least. I like the course, although experiences over last few years are making it difficult to continue to support them. I’ll give them one more chance i guess with a rain check."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"NOTE: Just read that you can’t submit booking issues here - but I”m not going to another website - but as i was typing this another email came in from your course that asked for feedback - and said “ and don’t forget, our best rates are online” - that’s 100% false, only 1 rate was online, nothing offered for seniors. I’m sure you won’t post this, but you need the feedback."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,This course is about as average as they come. Lots of houses through the neighborhood. Pace of play was very slow- probably due to the holiday weekend.... they’re nicer courses in the area charging the same price...
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Pleasantly surprised. The course is pretty challenging, and there's much more elevation than I would have expected. We walked, only to find out the course is not the best for that. Pretty spread out, and the ""clubhouse"" a very long walk from the starting tees. Disappointed that, at least this day, players didn't repair their ball marks on the greens. Not the course management's fault, as the greens were otherwise nice. Very few playing that day, so no pace of play issues. Hope to play here again, now that I know the layout, but price with a cart is significantly higher."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Course was in good shape and pin placements were in tougher spots
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Greens very receptive on approach shots,after that good luck very bumpy and tons of ball marks not fixed!!"
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Course has gone down over the last few years. Great location...sad they’ve let it come to this.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Enjoyed the course except for pace of play. Men’s club started before our round and it took 4.5 hours to play.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"The only downside is that it gets a lot of play do there are more divits on the tee boxes than I would like, but everything else is great."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"If you arent in good shape, get a cart. The distance between holes isnt much fun to walk of you're out of shape."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"What a wonderful course! The staff was accomodating. It was windy/wet for Indiana, but that is expected. The lay-out is great, and getting ready to get even better. They are planning a $2M upgrade."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Course in good shape for late season playNo Aeration holes to worry about on greens
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Great Value
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Had not played this course for a few years. Really enjoyed it today, and it was in good condition. Will go back again."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,This was the first time playing this course. I found it difficult to navigate the course because the signage was minimal to nonexistent getting from hole to hole.The cart paths are so far away from the greens that in many cases you can't see them if you didn't drive up on them.It was a little windy and the course was wet from an over night rain that was evidently heavier than the staff was aware of.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Greens were in great shape and the only disappointment was the pace of play....it shouldn’t take 4:30 minutes to play this golf course and didn’t have anyone out moving the slow groups ahead of us along...
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Very nice course that plays through some beautiful wooded areas. Pace was perfect for just 2 of us. We never waited on anybody and nobody ever had to wait on us. Some of the tee boxes were pretty chewed up but overall the whole course is amazing. Will definitely be back soon
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Played a few months ago. Ok shape. This morning - great improvement! Course in great condition, grass green, grown in, greens in decent shape, just need aeration. Well done!! Keep it up!"
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"I was able to sneak out while the weather was nice after the frigid month we've had. I found the course to be saturated, which is to be expected after the melting snow and rain. But it is something to note in-season when we do have soaking rains - maybe let it dry out a few days before playing it. I plugged balls on 3 greens on the back, and most steps around the course produced water."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"But, it was January, and they were open, and in good shape even with the wetness and cold weather. Looks like they are updating the range as well, which has always been one of the best around. The course routes through a neighborhood and has some challenging holes if you spray, but it's not the hardest course around (or easiest to be fair)."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"The course has a nice layout running through a neighborhood, but the houses are never really close. It's in decent shape after the rain, though some of the greens have some small bare spots, and a few look like they may have a disease or something forming on them. All of the greens could've used a mow and/or a roll as they were slow - jam it at the middle from anywhere variety of slow. Fairways were in good shape and bounced huge, so some of the drives we thought were solid wound up bouncing through them. Course knowledge will help that in the future, but be aware of the subtle small lakes and doglegs around the course your first time through. Use the cart GPS to help around the course, and also to find the first tee since it's nowhere near the club house."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,The course also has a nice driving range and practice facility. All-in-all you could do a lot worse around here. I like it better than it's sister course Ironwood. Book on their website to save a few bucks since they use dynamic pricing.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Great people and great course. I played with my 6yr old who gets trained here. Very friendly.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,My brother and I wanted to get out and play a new course to us on probably the last 'good weather' day of the Fall. We really enjoyed the colors as it is a beautiful course. We joined the pair following us on the back. Sure helps having local expertise on avoiding trouble! We had a great time and will definitely come back in the Spring!
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Good weather and course conditions made for a good day of golf. Only headache was battling leaves on fairways.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,We caught Gray EAgle on a very nice fall day --sunny and temperature in the 60's. The course is playing very well for this time of year. The greens were a little hard and would not hold and the putting surface very fast. But othrewise the course is in good shape and a good value
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"With such a nice layout, Gray Eagle could be an excellent venue. The problem is either course greens keepers or management don't seem to care. I've played this course nearly 50 times over the past 8 years, only because I live fairly close by. While the course shape is better this year than in the past 4-5, I'll bet it's more to do with our cooler/wetter summer than course management taking better care of the facility."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,The only reason I played yesterday was because of the GolfNow green fee of $19. It is not worth more than $20 on any given day. I shot a 93. The reasons are plentiful.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"1. The greens do not roll true from hole to hole. There are numerous holes, marks, brown spots and Cicada Killer burrows on three holes on the back nine.2. The bunkers are not sand. They are dirt or hard pan. It is not a test of golf skill but luck to get out of them with a decent putt opportunity.3. The course uses little flags positioned up and down the pin to determine pin location. They also have a pin position number noted on each hole on the scorecard. The pin position number is not accurate. I suspect they select a pin position number for the day, but the greens maintenance team do not adhere to this when setting up the holes.4. Yardage markers are non-existent on the tee boxes and barely existent on each hole. Without a range finder or gps you will have no idea your distance on any shot.5. Tee boxes are shredded and uneven. Good luck finding an small area to place your tee let alone stand without being in a hole or on slanted ground."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Although not a regular experience, one other thing happened yesterday that I am compelled to mention. I pre-paid for a 3-some at a great rate through GolfNow. It turned out that one of my 3 could not make it. I asked the man who checked me in to give this paid round to the next single who came in and ask him/her to join us if interested. While we were on the first tee getting warmed up a single showed up. I asked if he got his round for free. He said he did not. I believe Gray Eagle chose to charge him the regular rate rather than meet my request to increase some daily green fee take in. Rather unsporty if you ask me."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"I don't typically write reviews, and certainly not ones of this length. I only do so in hopes that the pro or management at Gray Eagle will see this and start to rethink their strategy to attract golfers. There are far too many courses in the area, and they're philosophy is not working."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"This course is great. Instead of telling you actual yardage they let you guess. What a cool feature. Who knows how far out you are, let's just hit a club and see what happens. No distance markers, always in terrible condition."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,We played Gray Eagle after significant rains. I felt the course and especially the greens were in tremendous shape. I typically don't provide reviews but Gray Eagle deserves accolades this time. We did play 18 and I did not have food so the review should be N/A in that regard. I shot 39-39 and I attribute that to great greens that rolled true and really great fairways that gave you nice lies almost 100% of the time. It was a Hot Deal at an exceptional price and the gentleman that set us up was very polite and welcoming. This was probably my best trip to Gray Eagle and one of the best playing locations all year.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Played twighlight and had no pressure on pace. Fun quick outing.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,There are a lot of courses in the Hamilton County area. I play this one about once every few years. It has some challenging holes. The downside is what they charge for green fees. A little pricey for what you get. It is strictly location driven.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,First time playing Grey Eagle and we really enjoyed it. The course was in great shape and the staff was very friendly. Great mix of holes and fun to play.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,The crew at Grey Eagle did a great job getting the course ready to play. Although all the bunkers were water hazards the rest of the course was in great shape.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"I felt I got a great value for the money and didn't have to wait on any hole. Cart path only made play a little slower, especially because you can't see the fairway well from the path on many holes...which is tough for club slection."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Great day overall.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"I booked a last minute tee-time for 2:20 p.m. I thought I was getting there with 10 minutes to spare to meet my boss - until I discovered GolfNow's GPS was taking me to Ironwood!! : ( By the time I got to Gray Eagle (about 10 minutes away) my boss had already called asking where I was, we didn't tee off until 2:40 p.m. and wound up bunching up with the next two singles behind us who both joined us for a foursome."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Course was well maintained from tee box to greens. Nice layout and had enjoyable afternoon in a round lasting less than 3 and 1/2 hours.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Course is routed through a housing development. Tee boxes were in rough shape and the greens had lots of unrepaired ball marks. Too few porta-potties and no beverage service on the course other than a couple of water kegs.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"The course was wet which means not much roll on fairways.If you play on this course in wet conditions its best to tee up onetee closer or you will have long irons or woods on some of thelonger par 4,s.the pace of play was slow but did improve on backgreens have a lot of ball marks which makes putting a challenge.For that reason i probably will not return.It was a great valuethru golfnow"
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Quite a variety to the course layout. Each hole very unique. Some distances between clubhouse to first tee, returning to clubhouse between 9th and 10th holes, and between some of the holes lends to necessitating cart usage. Also a variety of difficulty to the holes. Some play easy and short, others are lengthy distances, narrower, and more challenging.All in all, I like the course...but could use 1 or 2 permanent restrooms to replace the port-a-potties."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Have played here a few times. This course is always in good shape. This time it seemed that too many players before us do not repair ball marks on the greens. Not the courses fault, but it was an issue. Overall it is a fair test and a fun course."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Had a great round on a fantastic summer day! Only lost one ball. Woo hoo!!!
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,The course was in decent condition. The pace was slow. Too many ball marks not repaired.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Course in great condition, well cut, no lost balls just off the fairway, too much goose sh**t, but that's everywhere. Great golfing friends and a great time. Plus, on this particular day and time, we had the course pretty much to ourselves, no pushing, no waiting.SO, WHAT CAN I SAY, AN EXCELLENT ROUND FOR ALL, even though we didn't do too well.Big Al"
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Great course to play. Was in top notch shape and the staff was very friendly.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"It is a nice course and the layout is good. But, there was no sand in the bunkers, and both the tee boxes and greens need attentionvery badly."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"The course was well manicured and easy to find the green locations. However, some green were very difficult to putt on because of pin location and others were small."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"My friend and I are not great golfers. We went into the pro show here and talked to drew there about our play. He took five minutes to show us just a few little basics that had both of us shooting the best rounds of our lives. I improved my best score by 10 strokes!! He did this absolutely free and with nothing but grace, character and the hope that we had a better time golfing. They have my return business not only golfing but when I get to the point that I think I deserve some lessons or maybe new club or even just grips on what I've got I will be at gray eagle."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"I always have a good experience here. Greens could use a little more time to repair from the harsh winter and bug infestation last summer, but the overall quality of turf is good. Only criticism would be they don't bag the clippings in the rough and some false-front greens. Definitely considered a go-to for practice rounds."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,There are some challenging holes on this course. The layout is great but the conditions could be a lot better.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Decent course. A golf now deal is worth it. They have improved some of the tee boxes but they still need a little work.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"A nice mix of holes, some with length, some that are short and reachable. There a few tight tee shots, but the large undulating greens are the courses true defense."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Played at 11:30 am on Monday and trash cans were not emptied from Sundays rounds . Need a golf tee no problem as the tee boxes were littered with broken ones . The cashier always acts like I am bothering him when I come to check in and then walk to the snack bar that he has to cover . Here's a idea put a fridge by the check in desk!
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Compared to some other courses in the area the greens looked like it was the middle of July, not early May. The looked dry and had a lot of dead spots. I like the layout of the course and the practice facilities were good."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Although some greens are in rough shape. Great deal through golfnow
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,The course was in fairly good shape. The only problem was around (just off) the greens. There were hard spots without much grass.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,The course overall was in pretty good shape for this early in the season. Greens were very receptive and putted nicely. the fairways are in really good shape much better than expected!
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Gray Eagle has a great layout. The ownership just won't put the money into it to take it to the next level. Improve the greens, fill in the rough and add sand to the bunkers and traps and you have a great course. It is just very average right now."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"After early spring rains, course was cart path only. This did not detract from a great outing for 4 golfers with a wide range of skills. Generally fairways were in good shape ( considering severity of winter and recent rains) and were relatively dry and very playable. Front 9 greens were bumpy but improved greatly on back 9.Overall a better than average course and GREAT value for money.Pro Shop staff were very welcoming and accommodating.Since this outing was early spring, and mid week, there was no beverage cart, half way house or Porta Johns.Go play it - you will enjoy the course!"
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Descent course for the money, the condition was a little rough but we have had a horrible winter"
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,Very well lept for this time of year! Greens were very fast abd leaves were cleaned away from playing area.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"it is fall and we all are familiar with how we loose balls because of leaves. this course was kept very clean, very nice"
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"The course sets up to make the player hit some challenging shots. There are 5 par 5s and 5 par 3s with a range of difficulty for all of the holes. It wasn't challenging to the point of frustration, but more so than many of the other similarly priced courses in Indiana. We played in between probably 8 groups of twosomes, which we were the only group to actually join with another group on the first tee. It really slowed us down, when at the turn we had 3 groups get around us."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"The greens were extremely slow and looked as if they hadn't been cut in a few days. Overall , the course is not very challenging and if the pace of play can be at or less than 3 1/2 hours it is a decent trade off."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"A nice layout with good variety was overshadowed by wooly tees and greens and spotty fairways. The course has potential and it was well watered but the greens and tees needed to be mowed very badly. There were some difficult tee shots, especially for a player that works the ball right to left, but the course was a fair challenge."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,I see a course bash review here and have to scratch my head. I've lived near Gray Eagle since 2005 and play several times a year. O.K. it's not Augusta ... but it is a excellently maintained neighborhood course at a reasonable price. If I owned it I would not lower the price .. because it offers so much for the money now.
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"Family play is welcome here. Faster players will typically find themselves happily invited to play through. The par 3 holes are a lot of fun, the rough is primarily thin woods, knolls and creeks abound. For those with excellent driving skills Par 4 and 5 holes especially benefit from strategic play. Grass is green and well maintained... A wonderful place to enjoy mother nature on a breezy afternoon."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"I like Grey Eagle because it is convenient, affordable, and offers pretty good practice facilities. They have covered and outdoor ranges. The staff was pretty nice."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"They didn't have very many menu items at the snackbar and they were out of stock on some of the items they did have. This was a big bummer for me, because I intended to eat lunch at the course and purchase snacks there as well. I settled for some peanuts, but that certainly didn't cut it."
Gray Eagle Golf Club,29989-gray-eagle-golf-club,"This course is currently in the best condition I've seen it over the past 2 years. For early in the year, the greens were rolling better than most of the other courses I've played in the area so far this spring. Hopefully, they maintain it as usually by the summer the lack of maintenance or care starts to show which is unfortunate. It seems they are always busy and the range is full, which would make you believe they could afford to spend a little more to improve the course conditions or at least maintain them."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Great conditions and weather! But watch out for the mean lady on hole 6, according to her she will shoot somebody."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,played the two oldest 9 holes. had not played course in a couple of years. thought greens rolled very well as well as fairways. no complaints.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,This course is always very well maintained. It’s a fun course for all level of golfers. Place of play has not been an issue. I’ll definitely be back.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,We played in three hours and 45 minutes. The greens were in excellent condition even though there had been rain recently. This course always plays well and holds up very well when many other courses are cartpath only or closed.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Course is in good shape. Pace was slow on first 9 and then fast on the second. We didn’t feel welcome on the course though. None of the people we encountered made us feel like they wanted us there. Plenty of other options so I doubt we are back anytime soon.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"The fairways were in great shape. The greens were in great shape, the rough would penalize you"
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Great winter golf at the Legends. Ron the starter was very accommodating.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Fairways was in great shape, green are in great shape, the rough would make you pay a price"
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Numerous challenges, but not terribly difficult. Course was in great condition as always. You will enjoy your round IF you play the right tees."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,we played The Legends on a windy Nov. day. there are a lot of new houses(with new OB). Course in very good condition. Everyone was great to us.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"I'll never play The Legends Golf Club again. The starter was very rude to me and my guest, his treatment of customers is not acceptable. I run a small business and if any of my employees ever spoke to a customer, the way we were treated by the starter, I'd fire them on the spot. I've played too many public courses and some fantastic private courses around Indy to ever have to put up with a rude starter, and I just won't accept rude treatment when I'm the customer. This starter didn't ask us to move our cart, he could have easily said excuse me sir, do you mind moving or even said ""please"", but NO, he skipped polite asking nicely or even asking at all and went straight to giving orders/ commands, demands telling us to move our cart and when I looked at him in disbelief as he came flying up to us, he then goes onto say: ""I'll have your privileges taken away."" The only thing I said to him the entire time he was barking orders at us was that I don't want to ever play here again. I told him our tee time and we left. I paid for 2 rounds on golfnow but that's fine at least golfnow gets something, I like to support good companies. So, I went home and picked up my son and we went to a different course to hit balls, chip, and putt and enjoy the beautiful day. I was happy I even had time to mow the grass so the day wasn't wasted. So many great choices for golf around central Indiana to ever waste your time and money going to The Legends Golf Club. I've got a few buddies with similar experiences here also with a mean / nasty range/ starter, maybe it's time they look into this and hire some new folks that treat Customers with a smidge of respect. I'll be 100% sure to tell everyone I play with in the two golf leagues I play in and the other league I sub in, as well as, my weekend group I play with about my experience at The Legends Golf Club, I think I have a complete email list also to all the members at Old Oakland Golf Club too from when I was a member there, but I doubt they'd care about a public course like The Legends, but I'll let them know too just in case. Play anywhere besides The Legends Golf Club is my best advice for every and All Golfers!"
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Nice balance of challenging holes and gettable holes! Water, elevation and bunkers are well placed and demand consideration"
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"27 holes of golf, all well cared for. Practice facilities are top notch. Not very difficult but scores have to be earned. I enjoyed playing here for third time this year."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Always enjoy playing the Legends.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,The course is always in great shape and a pleasure to play.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Don't come to this place unless you are super good at golfing. We played in a reasonable pace as amateurs, but we were rushed on every holes by the ranger. When we finished 9 holes, the ranger told us that we have to finish the 9 holes in two hours, otherwise, he is going to remove us from the course. We felt this is rude. We paid to play the course as friends together, just for a relaxed game and having some fun. This course is definitely not for that. Stay away from it."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,You can always count on this course being in good shape.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"I live an hour north of Legends, but I was happy that I made the drive. Great Pete Dye layout, friendly staff, and friendly people on the course. It is still early in the year and the grasses are not active and growing, but the course is in great shape and the greens are very nice considering the time of the year. I’ll be back."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,it’s still technically winter here. Had a good time and would play again here but summer prices are a little crazy. The staff was very nice and helpful.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,The 27 hole regulation course has some wonderful undulating greens. The middle and road 9 have housing on several holes. The creek 9 has no housing and some rolling terrain.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,The Dye Course has abandoned the back 9 on its par 3 course.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Creek to MiddleStarter starts us start on creek, we tee off as a twosomeGo to our balls and starter comes out tells us to go backto tee, we need to start over????? We drive back then he tells usto join another twosome, who are in separate carts, what a way to start the round. What a cluster F—-kWon’t be back. Not worth the drive."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Loved the choice of tees. Love the lack of blind shots. It is all in front of you.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"27 holes available, reasonably priced, and terrific greens. Sign me up. It was a bit windy (like it normally is out here in the converted corn field), so scores suffered, but what a great track given the location. Not a bunch of up and down terrain, but most greens are elevated, there is a water hazard (penalty area now I guess) that comes into play on almost every hole. No duplication or similar holes at all. My favorite, although it isn’t the original 18, is the Creek 9. Normally in better shape, has the hardest par 3, par 4 and par 5 back-to-back-to-back on the whole 27 (IMO). Numbers 2, 3, and 4 will eat your lunch if the wind is blowing from the North! So much fun here, and the people are great."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,I will play here again. And again.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Great time, course was in great shape. Pace of play was a little slow, but not bad, about 4 1/2 hours. Tee boxes could be in better shape, green were fair to good. Fairways and rough were well maintained. Overall, great round for the money."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Ranger told us on 3 occasion to pickup the pace. When the group in front us wasn't clear for us to hit. The Rangers needs to identify were the problem is before ask a group to pickup pace. This was a extremely disappointing day of golf.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Paired up as a single force to ride with a strangeror pay additional $16 for separate cart. Round took 4:45 and didn’t see first ranger. Not going back.Greens need a lot of work .
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,It was raining when we got there. But the entire staff was very friendly. The course was beautiful. And it quit raining about the ninth hole. The sun came out and it was a great day
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Had some unseasonal warm weather on new years eve so we decided to enjoy a final round of golf in 2021. The course was very wet in areas but considering the weather in previous days it was actually in great shape. The greens were perfect and the tee boxes were good as well. Pace was fast and we had no issues at all. If you want a fun course with plenty of differing holes you should try the Legends!
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,The course was in great shape for December. I lost my driver cover and my phone and they had them the next day.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Shaggy gon sneeze. Get em wet shaggy. Bet you want to make a big ol sandwich.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"The course was in good to great condition, especially considering the recent lack of rain. The fairways and greens were in good condition. The tees were a little hard, but not bad. There was a foursome a couple of groups in front of use that was really slow. So we did some waiting on a lot of the holes. It was really hot, and it would have been nice if there was complimentary tap water with ice in insulated cups available. They did have complimentary water with ice in the club house. But the cups were small, and not insulated (paper). My ice lasted about two holes."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"We enjoyed the round; course is challenging and well-taken care of. Only complaints is that they put us with two other golfers with a very limited vocabulary (cursing every other word) even though the course was not that crowded. Secondly, on more than one hole, the sprinklers were on in the fairway as we were playing through--a worker was even present, but did not turn them off so we could play through them. Other than these things, it was a great round at a great price--would play it again!"
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"The course is in great shape. Good to see a club, that gets a lot of play, be in terrific."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,The staff and marshalls were very unfriendly and treated us like we didn't belong. I will NOT be playing this course again.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,It’s nice playing a course in such good condition.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,My son and I book a tee time on Father's day and when we arrived we paid and got out to start and they told us we had to pair up with 2 people we didn't know. I ask for money back and I was told to bad. The owner is extremely rude. My son and I were stuck paying 110 bucks and didn't get to enjoy ourselves. If they would have said from the beginning we would be paired we would of went somewhere else but they didn't.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"The Legends of Indiana in Franklin, Indiana is always in nice condition. The fairways are reasonably wide, but some are harder to hit. The greens have plenty of undulations and are of average speed."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,First time playing and I’ll be back for sure. Beautiful course and challenging for an intermediate player.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"The legends golf club is a great value and gives off the feel of a true golfers facility with its driving range, putting greens, and 27 hole course. The whole area is nice and open so nothing feels cramped. The course itself is a nice layout and was in pretty good shape for fairly early in the season. I also enjoy coming to legends."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Pros; played middle to roadGreens as always smooth and fastFairways a little spotty but very nice4 hour round not badCons:Lady at desk and starter not on same pageShe said single joining us starter said another 2 someWorked out well Two nice guysBunkers need some work
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Very smooth day, even with a high volume of golfers. Staff was friendly and efficient. Will definitely return!"
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"The course is in very bad condition, very muddy after rain. It was rainning during our play. Tried to ask for a rain check but was declined. Will not play there again."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Course was in great shape. Greens were fast and true. The starter acted like he had better things to do than be bothered by my question about the rotation I was playing.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Drove by this course several times but never made time to stop in. The staff was courteous and attentive. (With COVID 19, make sure to be there early to check in.)The course was well maintained, but that is because the grounds crew was trimming the greens as we were chipping up. The signage needs some attention. For a first timer, it was difficult to get to the starting tee and the follow-on back nine. For the expense, I would call ahead next time and figure out the grounds crew schedule before I booked."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,The greens are in great shape. The course in general is well maintained.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,This is the second time i have played here. The place is well organized and flows real smooth. I say it’s the chic filet of courses because the staff are so nice/ courteous they make you feel like you have been going here for years. Even the ranger is a awesome dude i love this place just wish i lived a little closer.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Most impressive were the greens. Some marks from players failing to repair divots, but it’s obvious the greens crew know how to manicure a green. Smooth, fast rolls, that break true. Impressive for Indiana in September."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Very Good course, great price on deal. Our 4-some enjoyed the course and the challenge. Hope play a few more times before winter."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Booked the wrong course and Golfnow website would not allow me to cancel.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Since we reserved our round for only 3 people, the possibility of a ""perfect stranger"" joining us is always there. I asked the young man in the club house if the course had a provision for providing and extra cart for such a situation. He said that a 4 person round merits 2 carts. A third cart would cost $16. I let him know that just down the road (Timbergate), they had modified their carts with a plexi-glass barrier that extend the length of the interior of the cart, effectively ""dividing"" the cart in half when it came to breathing space. Legends should do the same with some their carts!"
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"It was “ Blistering Hot!” yesterday, so I really appreciated the course having ice water available in the course coolers and clubhouse!"
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,First course I’ve seen doing this yet this year w all the COVID 19 restrictions
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Thanks for your service!
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"I've been going here for a while and the course is always in great shape. Course plays long especially for my game but no complaints. Fairly wide open with exception of some water and sand which i seem to find. Good staff, mostly friendly. My only complaint is paying $16 extra to ride solo thru the week when they weren't busy at all. Doesn't seem fair that people with underlining conditions have to pay extra to golf. Weekends I totally understand. But overall I like this course."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,I really enjoyed playing here. It was my first time to play. We played Creek & Road. The course offers plenty of challenges but isn't unfair. Greens were beautiful. It was in very good shape.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Had a great day of golf. Got a good rate on golf now. 12 dollars cheaper than at the course. Friendly staff. Golf conditions were good. Had been several years since playing at the legends. The course had grown a little and it probably was not in as good of condition as it had been when I played there about 5 years ago, but still nice and worth playing. My only gripe would be the poor sand quality that is in the bunkers. It is sand you see on a Indiana beach or quarry. Not the kind of sand that should be used for a golf course. Enjoyed my day of golf as the weather was great and shot a 76 from the black tees."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Excellent condition. Friendly service. Good food.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Great for under 30.00 course I near nowhere tho. Lol
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Course was in decent shape. Work needs done around the ponds
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Being there for the first time the layout was very confusing. The course was in very good shape.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"They know how to run a golf course. Packed on a Sunday afternoon, but wife and I played in 3-1/2 hrs even with cart path only. Course in great shape. All for $20. Pretty tough to beat."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"The course was in very good shape for the middle of summer. However, the course layout seemed boring and flat for the hype it gets in Indiana. There are other nearby courses that are more fun and cheaper. Also, the starter got mad at us for getting to the tee box 1 minute behind schedule even though no groups were behind us. We caught up to a few groups in front of us within 5 holes and the pace of play was very slow from there."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"The middle and road nines get all of the love at the legends, but the creek 9 is my favorite of the three. The opening hole is a solid dog leg par 5 that can be birdie or double depending on how you play it. The second hole is a formidable par three and arguable the toughest hole on the property with length and a pond that is highly in play. The rest of course offers a great challenge and offers a good variety to the course."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"I am a new member at the legends this year, and I have been very pleased with the course so far. The course has been n good shape for the fall. The greens are in good shape considering how much play the course gets. The middle/road course is more of a links style layout with a good variety of holes. The layout can be scored upon depending on the wind. The bunkers could use some work, but other than that it has been excellent fall golf. The customer service is excellent!"
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Played Sept of 2019. Course was in very good shape. Good course to visit. Wouldn’t play it every week but look forward to playing it when I do.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,we had a fun day of golf at the Legends...the course was in good shape...a few blind shots but pretty good layout...there are a lot of good golf courses in indy...this would be in the middle of the pack
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Staff friendly. Course in very good shape. Layout is fun. Pace very nice. Would play frequently if I lived in Indy.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"It was a beautiful late summer day and I think everyone had the same idea as me. The course was packed from morning till dusk. They did a good job of keeping everyone moving. However, we were backed up on 2-4 holes. Not terrible but a little bit of a delay. The course was in outstanding condition. I started at the range, then the chipping green, and ended up playing all three courses before the day ended. If they can keep people moving, this course is definitely worth a visit."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"I live in the area and have played this course maybe 10 times. I love the course and conditions are always pretty good. The course needs to better maintain three things though. 1. Cut down tall shrubs around the ponds, on some holes when playing from the blue you have no view of the fairway. 2. Need to water the rough, hitting from rough was like hitting from concrete (this is a common problem in most courses this year due to heat). 3. Sand in the bunkers is very grainy can use new sand.I will still go and play again though, fairways and greens are perfect even after this scorching heat and staff is very friendly and accommodating."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,This course is always in good shape !Greens are always smooth and usually fastGood layout with all the trouble you need with errant shotsPlay this course about 25 time a yearNever get tired of it !BG
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Melted in the heat around the Middle/road course at Legends. The course has an interesting layout, with some contours that are links-style, but enough trees on it here and there to not really be a links course. Some water in play as well. Putts never broke as much as I expected. Overall most of the course was in good shape, with some minor spotting here and there in the fairways. Greens and tees were solid. Sand was a little inconsistent and rocky. They care about and enforce pace of play, which more courses should do. Definitely worth a stop if you're driving down 65. I'll be back to check out the other 9 and par 3 course."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"I was very impressed as a first timer at the Legends course. The staff was friendly and professional. The course had numerous challenges including bunkers, water hazards, and long grass, yet there were opportunities to score well on many of the holes. Overall, a great course and value. I would highly recommend to any golf enthusiasts."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"The course was in excellent condition. Greens and tee beds very nice. Rough was challenging, so great incentive to keep shots straight and on target. Bunkers in decent shape, although the sand includes little stones.I like that the course management provides written responsibilities for those using the course, both in maintenance and time management."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,The course was very wet which made for challenging play from the rough. Cart paths were flooded.All that said and the course was still playable!
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Creek for First nine. Needs a little TLC. Bunkers a little rough, and the grass needs some love. But it's early. Road nine in much better shape. Definitely had more care and attention. Good round. Good course. Not what it was, but still a good track."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"This course was in pretty good shape for early season. With all the rain we have had, I wasn't expecting the course to be in good shape but I was pleasantly surprised."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"The course conditions this morning weren't the best, mainly due to the heavy rains. Other than that, it looks like the course will be in great shape once again this year at the Legends. Can't beat it for then money either."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"The Legends was a very nice course. Very well-kept even after some rain. But, no ranger out to monitor pace of play. We got stuck behind a slow foursome and wasn’t able to get in front."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Nice option in the greater Indianapolis area. Played 36 holes with my group from Michigan without having to play the exact same 18. Fun course...we had a nice time here.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"It was my second time playing there, but won’t be the last. Course was in great shape, layout was fun to play, and staff was very nice and helpful."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"My daughter and I played 9 holes on a rainy day. The course was pretty much empty as the weather front scared people off for a couple of days. However, course was in great shape. I play golf about 3-5 times per month and this is one of the better condition courses I’ve okayed on this year. We will definitely be back, just hoping for better weather."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"First, booked middle and road nines. When arrived we were sent to road and creek nines. You should be able to book what you want to play."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Second, every trap was unplayable. The course was wet, but there wasn’t sand in the traps if conditions were drier. Sad to see an old reliable course begin the slide downhill"
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"The Legends is a very nice track. It was my third time playing there this year. Everything was great...however the greens were a little dry. Pretty sure they were under some heat stress. Same goes for the fairway and rough areas. Overall though, it's still a great course (at a great price). Definitely worth the drive."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Legends is a mere shadow of the pristine splendor it was years ago.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"The Legends is one of my favorite courses in Central Indiana...it didn't disappoint this past Sunday. Great pace of play, beautiful course conditions, and a great layout...the only downside is that it was a little wet on the course from the previous evening. Other than that, it was great!"
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Played here the last 3 Sundays, so I wanted to get a review in. Course is in pretty solid shape, tee boxes are good, fairways are firm and greens are firm and fast. Most bunkers are in good shape, though I found a few that hadn't been treated in a while. Rough is dry and can be patchy. I'm good with that - it's not where you should be hitting and if you do, it should be a challenge. Just don't expect the ball to hang up much, so if you're crooked it's gonna bounce."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"If you've haven't played here before, you should really enjoy the day. I like the layout, with a some fairly generous landing areas in the fairway and some elevated greens. I think the course pivots nicely from harder holes to easier ones, keeping pace well. Wind is always a factor out there, so club appropriately. Water isn't predominately a factor unless you're chunking the ball. From the right tees, you can bust a good tee shot to get a good look at birdie, and the Par 5s are gettable too. I really like the start on the Road side, with a par 5, then back to back tough par 4s."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Volume is up thanks to the membership deal (incl. me); I'll be watching to see if they can keep the pace (with volume/conditions and actual pace of play).
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Made tee time 2 days in advance and couldn’t even play the course I paid for because they were too busy so they pushed me over to another 9 holes which wasn’t as nice. Pretty disappointing!
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Greens rolled very well, but the rest of the course was rough."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Always happy to get a round in this late in November. The course was in great condition. Very few people on the course so we played at our own pace which is pretty quick (18 holes in 2.5 hours).
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"a little pricey for the end of October, that is only complaint."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Played creek and road nines. Creek was very slow pace. No groups allowing play through. Bunkers had grape sized rocks in them. Not impressed. Road nine was quick. Dont care for houses that close. Bunkers were better. Not bad for a hot deal but not worth the drive for me.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Course was in perfect condition and greens were in great shape. This course has always been in emmaculate condition. I recommend this course for experienced golfers.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Greens were in excellent condition, pace was good. Some bunkers need work as too muddy conditions others were great."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Great course, excellent value! Course was in perfect condition."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Course was in great shape, well kept. Amazing course for the discount price."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,I love this course- I'm almost always a single and they have never had a problem. Other golfers also understand and let me play thru all the time.(some places I play they won't let me play thru no matter how slow they are)
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Bunkers and upper tee boxes still need work.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Keep up the great work!
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,I purchased a 3:34pm tee time thru GolfNow for 9 holes at $20/person. When I got there I was told that it's $23/person. Shower them my confirmation/receipt and they still refused to honor the $20/9 holes. Ended up paying the extra money and played anyway. Sand traps haven't been raked all season and ended up moving ball out of traps due to poor conditions. Didn't want to break a club or my wrist.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Greens quick and fairways were rolling well. Only drawback were bunkers that had been replenished but not worked.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Every time I play this course. I always end up thinking....Why don't I play here more often?!Just a great course. Greens are flat. It never breaks as much as it looks.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Hadn't played the course in a couple of years. Surprised at how bad a condition it was in.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,I really enjoyed this course. I was a single and got paired with a threesome and we all had a great time. Very nice course the only downside to the course is the green wasn't mowed.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"The course was in decent condition for February weather, Greens were better than expected although bunkers are still out of play due to winter weather. Definitly looking forward to the spring! Should be ready then."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,The course and greens were in great shape except for the usual bit of Fall debris on the greens (pine needles / leaves etc.) The tee markers were not there for some reason but had my GPS and estimated approx. tee position. Overall very happy with the course!
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,The condition of the course (Middle & Road nines) was excellent. Fairways and greens were in peak shape. Certainly no signs or after effects from any aeration or top dressing. Greens held very well and putted exceptionally true.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,This is my 3rd time playing this Course and the Course was in the Best Condition of all them. The Fairways were cut nice and the Greens were Great as well.And at Golf now price it was well worth and and look forward to coming back. Would love to play Creek but thats not offerd on Golf Now.The staff was great as well as the Tenderloin Sandwich.Multiple sets of tees allow every golfer of every skill level to enjoy great time.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,The course was in great condition and the staff was very friendly
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Only played here a few times, mostly because of distance from my home, bit absolutely love this course! Very well maintained with the truest rolling greens! Scenic layout with varying challenges. Number of bunkers is a little intimidating, but fortunately we stayed out of them for most of the round! Wish this course was closer as I would play here more often! Highly recommend to anyone who wants to play a truly nice and challenging course!"
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Pete Dye courses are infamous for their number of bunkers and for that reason they should be in excellent condition. The bunkers appear to have not had new sand added since the course originally opened. Most of them not raked and edges not pulled up on any of them with 98% of them having rutted edges from wash-out. Several had grass growing in them.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Otherwise, it's an above average course. Would play there again if the GN deal was right."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Very fast greens and course is in phenomenal condition! Very challenging for all levels! I didn't care for the bunkers because they had a lot of pebbles and hard compacted sand but fairways and greens are perfect! Beautiful golf course!
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,My son and I had a great time playing here the greens were fast and pure we played from the blues and was a good challenge for the both of us
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,I don't play this course very often but when I do it's always in superb shape and is well worth every penny that is spent on it. I played on May 23rd and the day couldn't have been any more perfect except for a lower score. If you haven't played here you are missing out on a true gem in the Indianapolis area.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Greens are fast and smooth. I play this course quite often. The course is always in good shape except the sand traps which does not matter to me. They are much better now.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Good course - played 18 in 4 hours - only issue was there were no ball washers on the course and had been alot of rain - no way to clean muddy ball.staff was friendly
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Love the course the only problem I have the bunkers need work
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Course was in great shape even thoughbthe climate has been very dry the last month.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"We grabbed a Hot Deal, and played Sunday October 11. Course was in outstanding condition. Greens are fast and true. Fairways are lush and green. Tee boxes were well kept. I've played here many times in the past. It is a similar course to Heartland Crossing, but the Legends must have more cash behind the operation because they are doing a much better job of keeping up their property."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Great course for Fall play. Fewer trees means less time trudging through the leaves.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,We had a very enjoyable time. The course was in excellent condition. I'll be back reasonably soon.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Course in great shape for all the rain we have had
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"This was the third tone I've been on this course, with all the train we've had the course was still in great shape, the creek on 15 was a large pond and I really liked it, they should make it permanent"
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Understanding that it has been wet but that is no reason to stop all course up keeping. Great design, just seems the course is being let go."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Great course but it was a little bit saturated due to all the rain
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"The Legends is well known around town. Everything was great except one thing. The greens were rough. The ball would bounce most of the way to the hole on more than a few holes. Other than that, was a good time. Would have been even better if it wasn't for my terrible score!"
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"This course offers a number of different options. There is the 27 hole course, as well as, a 18 hole par 3 course. Course was in good condition. The grounds crew was out doing some much needed work on the bunkers. Would recommend."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,had a great time...played well and the people I played with played well. Staff was very accommodating for a single player.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"I come here a lot and a girl who was just started working snack bar was taking care of me she was awesome she had went to the back to go grab some banana peppers for my sandwich and Cindy Bishop comes slamming the side door open saying, "" Sorry______ is new she doesn't know what she is doing yet."" I proceeded to say she is taking care of me just fine and her sister works here and She knows her way around. And Cindy then said, "" well I'm sorry for the slow pace"" The young lady taking care of me was excellent she is a server and knows her way with food and drinks. I have never been so embarrassed for a manager until that day. Cindy needs to learn to treat her employees a lot better and more people might come in and get food and drinks if she knew how to treat people."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"I moved here from FL so I'm a bit spoiled by great golf and service. This is a good track, nice layout. Minimal interaction with the staff but it was just okay, not great."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,I really like the layout of a few different holes on the course my only complaint is that the fairways and greens were in bad shape. I expected them to be in tip top shape for the 40 a person. I have played city courses that are in better shape then this one is at the moment. Staff was amazing. Also they had a demo out on the range that was supposed to last until 3pm but they packed up at 230 and left. Right as we were coming off of hole 18.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Nice course. Conditions were great. Forgiving course.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,this is a nice course!! the facilities are nice and the greens and tee boxes are really nice!! the only thing I thought would be nicer are the fairways but I still highly recommend it!!
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Played this morning, was a nice day & course was in great shape. We had a lot of rain yesterday, but this course drains pretty well. Tees, fairways and rough were all maintained nicely. Greens were in great shape and fast. Bunkers are being worked on (according to signage on clubhouse) and they were a little blown out by water. I only found 2 of them today and took advantage of the rake/re-drop rule in effect. This course is almost always in good shape, today no exception. I'd have expected them to ask for a little more competitive green fee (we pd. 45) for Oct mid-week, but we got a good course."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"The Legends is a nice course, home of the Indiana chapter of the PGA. Expect some challenges, not many trees but plenty of water and sand. 27 holes to choose from as well, so always an adventure!"
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Played at 4pm and everything was great!There was a slow twosome in front of us, but it was a beautiful day and beautiful course :)"
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"I played this course in early June and loved it. Soft tee boxes, well-kept fairways and fast, smooth greens. Unfortunately it seemed as if the maintenance staff had merely quit trying towards the end of the summer. It was still in ""good"" shape but not nearly as nice as earlier in the year. The most noticable difference were the greens. Speed and smoothness of the greens had significantly decreased. Still a good value at $20 to ride 18, but didn't leave wanting to come back soon."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Very challenging course for the average player.very nice practice facility .prices in the club house were very reasonable and the staff was very polite
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"course in great shape, Bunkers need attention, not much sand more like dirt."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Apparently golfers at these courses don't know how to fix ball marks. Maybe the softness of the greens contributed to multiple unrepaired divots on greens. The greens were fairly fast and true but unrepaired divots impacted several putts. The fairways were mowed at higher level than you normally experience on courses charging $55 a round. Sand traps were littered with rocks due to deteriorating condition of upper bunker walls. Glad I didn't pay full price to play this course.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Course was in great shape a lot of sand traps beware
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"very nice course that is in great shape,was a great deal"
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,This is a great daily fee golf course. Three nines so pace of play is outstanding. Well designed with good greens. Always an enjoyable game.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,This was the first time I played this course. Course was in good condition and I would definitely play here again.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Course very well maintained and in excellent condition. Rough not to high. Greens in excellent shape. Staff was friendly. I played as a single with no problems. 2 4-somes let me play thru as well... which was nice for a change.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,since I am used to playing golf ind western Pennsylvania this course was a nice reprieve. my brother and I play there on Monday afternoon and there were hardly anyone on the course. the course was well maintained and had a nice variety of difficulty. sand traps were a little hard but that is nothing out of the ordinary. the greens were freshly top dressed and still a little quick I can't imagine how they are in normal play. my only complaint is that they recently put in 15 inch holes to accommodate soccer players to play foot golf. this would not have bothered me but I had an eagle attempt on a par 5 and the 15 inch hole was right and my way. well well worth the 20 on golfNow definitely get a round in there
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,Has it all for the beginners to the scratch golfer.
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Course was heavily watered, no roll on fairways. Understandable for these weather conditions. Greens rolled true and were in good condition. Good experience."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,We booked Middle to Road but when we arrived we were put onto the Middle to Creek. Then while making the turn a two some was put in front of us slowing the back nine down by over 30 minutes. Not the best!
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Moreover, I can play without crowded because 27 holes."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,This course is not the longest you will play but these Par 4's that are less then 400 yards are very challenging! GIR's are very important because scrambling is tougher at this course then most! This is a direct affect of the course being a Pete Dye design. And throw in the wind and you have all the challenge you will need. This is a great course regardless how long off the tee the player is! I will be back again for sure...
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"I got a great deal at a great course, thanks golfnow!"
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"The course was in great shape and challenging as always. Unfortunately the rate I booked was for a senior rate, so we had to pay more to play. Nevertheless, I would recommend this course for sure."
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"Despite weather changes, Legends remains the best condition course I have played in Indiana during the month of October. Greens were firm but a well placed approach shot was easy to keep on. Only real complaint was that a few bunkers were rock hard and very difficult to control. Overall, highly recommended"
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,recommend staff very friendly had good time would play again
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,It had been at least 10yrs since I had played here and I expected it to look as good as it did because it was The Legends!! It was raining half of our round and it was stillGREAT!!!
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,"greens always in great shape and very consistent,bunkers could use some sand and attention,for cost GPS would be nice on carts,great practice range"
The Legends Golf Club - Dye Course,28996-the-legends-golf-club-dye-course,I thought this was a very nice course/layout away from the city. It is a bit of a drive from Indianapolis but well worth the drive at least once. The course was in great condition from tee to green and the staff was super friendly in accommodating us. Get a group of buddies together and have a good time playing a very nice course. I give it a 4 stars and not a 5 because the fairways are bluegrass instead of bent grass (personal preference and not meant to be a knock on the course). If you like bluegrass you will likely love this place and give it a 5.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"For early spring, the course was in very good shape. It is an enjoyable layout to play with some very cool holes and great elevation changes. The greens seemed to be rather large and many of them had major undulations. A number of the tee boxes were not flat so we teed off either in front of or to the side of the markers a few times. Also, some of the cart paths were broken up in places and need repairs."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,A couple of the fairways in the middle of each side are rather tight and you have to hit a very straight ball to get it in play. The first hole is a little odd with a very sharp dogleg right. No. 17 is very picturesque but challenging. You have to hit a pretty big fade to have a chance for a decent second shot to a green that is surrounded by water.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"The course is kind of in the middle of nowhere, about 30 minutes west of Indy but it is worth it to make the trip. The staff was quite friendly and helpful."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Course was in fair shape for my off-season round, several tee boxes were closed. Greens were slow but in good condition. I enjoyed the use of the creeks / hills to create character. The East half of the course has a lot of hills and a creek that run through it that were the best holes in the course."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Well worth your trip to play.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"The staff is great. The pro is a good guy. The course is not in good shape. The greens are SLOW. You have to HAMMER the ball to get it to the hole. Ball marks everywhere, no one fixes them. Tee boxes are either humped or have no grass. I wish the course was in better shape because the people running the place are good people. If they want more play, they need to level the tees and speed up the greens! For the cost, you can play much better courses in the area..."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Bent fairways, great layout, beautiful greens, one of the best courses in central Indiana, just 25 minutes west of Indy. Played there dozens of times, never gets dull. A great course in great condition."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,A wonderful place to play golf . It great the way staff handling Cov 19 Very professional on top of it .
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"I was only play able to play the back nine twice due to a middle school outing on the front. However, the course was overall in good condition. A few tea boxes and some fairways showed some really bald patches, but the greens were in great shape, although a little bit soft. Call back nine was definitely challenging, making club selection off the tea something you need to think about. Definitely a good course for the $27 that I paid to play 18 with the cart."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Course was in great shape in spite of dry weatherChallenging but reasonable. Lots of elevation changes and hazards. Better than most courses in Indy. ( I say most only because there are a couple courses I have not played)
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"This course is way off the beaten path, but worth the drive. Course is in good shape even with the dry weather we have had. Challenging with lots of hills and hazards and good price too!"
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"fun to play... liked having the 1st and 2nd cutting of rough....at the turn found new groups in front of us, how did that happen (had teed off at 7:30ish)....would encourage putting real sand in the bunkers and suggest reforming a couple of them... also would blow up number 17 and start over, could find nothing about this hole to make it your 'signature hole""...workers on the course were kind, helpful, and hard at work, nice to see workers keeping up the tee stations...will play again - thanks!"
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"This is a beautiful course with lots of trees lining fairways. It has many holes with elevation changes. Design makes you avoid water hazards by taking shorter drives to play safe or take risk/rewards by driving over. Rough is cut high so hitting out of requires power and irons. My daughter and I played nine and walked and got a good workout. Great value on price, clubhouse is clean and welcoming. Staff was very nice. Highly recommend a round here."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,The hot deal did not say anything about the first nine greens been aerated so I could only play on the back nine twice to get 18 holes all the other online teetimes mentioned the greens being aerated but I don't look at them I look at the hot deals only and it did not mention that at all. the golf course had to call me later after I scheduled a teatime to let me know this was happening I wish the hot deal tab would show this as well. Don't know if this falls under rescheduling as a non-playable course condition or not
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Don't waste your time going to any other golf course in Hendricks county. Deer Creek is in the best shape, most challenging, and is the best value of them all, hands down! Plus, the staff are extremely friendly and helpful. Other courses in the area usually have one thing or another wrong with them: fairways or greens torn up, bunkers in bad shape, or tee boxes all weeded out. Not here, all of it is good. I play here at least once a month and always find it challenging (holes 2, 4, and 13 usually). They always keep me coming back. Can't go wrong with this place!"
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Excellent course , easy access from airport & Plainfied hotels. Great friendly staff. Course is always in great condition & well groomed. Very challenging course. For the business traveler that wants to get out of the hotel this is a great deal."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,This course has been consistently in great shape for last two years. Friday's round was no different. Certainly one of best values in area.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Made a stop and golfed here on my way to Indianapolis. It's easy to find, and signage is all over the interstate. The greens were in wonderful shape, the fairways were well taken care of and watered. The pro shop is nice with excellent service. I highly recommend this course."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Everyone should play here what a wonderful place to be right by the grays are excellent at Fairways at flights and the secondary rough is excellent
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,This course is in wonderful condition. Everyone who plays golf needs to play this course is in such great shape and such a great course to play
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Even without the eclipse the course would have been enjoyable...more character than many. Despite our lack of rain, the greens and fairways were very good.The tees were not as good."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Deer Creek Golf is a great place to play golf it's challenging The course is in excellent shape it is probably one of the finest courses that I can say that I play it's always in great shape clean everything a great Golf course go play it
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"This is the first time I have played this course. Overall it was in very good to excellent condition. My only problem was that not having played it before there were several blind shots that resulted in a couple of lost/water balls. Not used to so many layup blind tee shots that penalize you for not knowing the course. The layout is good and interesting but now that I have played it I think if I play it again(which I probably will) I will definitely take a different approach. Course is definitely worth playing again though, especially at GN's Hot Deal price."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"I had a great time playing this course. It was well kept but the lay out was a bit tricky since it was my first time out. But to help with that, the scorecard contains a ""play by play"" description of each hole to help visualize what's coming at you. There was plenty of water to drink on the course along with a bathroom facility which came in handy."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,I made my reservation through GolfNow and I had no issues getting on. The staff was aware of my reservation and got me out quickly. I strongly recommend playing this course for an enjoyable experience.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Nice course nestled in the trees which made it tight in spots. Lots of hills and some water. Greens were tremendous, but not too fast. Had the course to ourselves, so play was fast (< 3 hours for 18). Great value for nice course."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Played on Friday morning and it was packed and very congested. Everyone seemed in a hurry-- a ranger should would be nice to see during the busy times. Other than that it was an enjoyable day at a nice course with some difficult holes.The greens were really marked up but that's probably do to all the play the course gets.For the GN discounted rate you can't beat it.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Course is fun and challenging. Many tall/hazardous trees. Fair amount of bunkers and other hazards. Definitely a course that requires accuracy. Always in good shape.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,This course is an hidden jewel. The course is well maintained coupled with a friendly and courteous staff. I recommend this course 100%.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Course was in excellent condition considering all the rain we have had layout is a little confusing but marked pretty well had just 2 in my group but played in 3 hrs course plays a little long for seniors but overall great experience got a great deal on golfnow will definitely play there again hopefully many times arrived about 40 minutes before tee time and the young lady at the counter let us out early nice pro shop and snack bar
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"We liked the course. There could be a few more signs directing you to the next hole as some are not obvious. Very narrow fairways are the rule, and definitely read the tips on the score card. On several holes you must be in the correct place to have a chance at par."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,The course was in decent shape. The tee boxes and greens were just aerated and the fairways were nice. The one problem I have with the course is the bunkers. I refused to play out of the 2 I landed in. They felt like they had a quarter inch of tiny pebbles on top of concrete. I felt that if I played out of them I had a risk of damaging my clubs.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,DEER CREEK GOLF COURSE HAS ONE OF THE BEST LAYOUT AROUND. ALL THE HOLES ARE MARKED AND EASY TO FIND. THE COURSE IS ALWAYS GREEN AND MANICURED TO THE TEE!! DEER CREEK IS ONE OF MY FAVORTIE COURSES TO PLAY AND THE FOOD IS GREAT AS WELL.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,My wife and I booked our round because of an awesome deal on GolfNowTurned out to be a great day and course
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Course is always fun to play. A lot of hills on the front nine. Hole 8 is my favorite it being a par three tee box drop off then uprising island green. Course is in great condition and well worth the money
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"I was the first one off at 9:40 today, and got around as a single in 1:50. The course is in fantastic shape for April. Greens were true, fairways in good shape."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,I really enjoyed the tight holes in the trees. I see them being very visually intimidating during the summer when in full bloom. The course has a good mix of elevation change and in style of holes. Water comes into play from time to time as well. Watch out for the blind pond on 2 off the tee. Make sure to get far enough off the tee to see the peninsula green on 17 as well.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"The course is worth the trip from the Indy area, especially at the hot deal rate."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Well manicured. Challenging. Highly recommend
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,course always seems to be in very good condition
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,First time I played this course and it was pretty nice. Greens were in excellent condition. Fairways were a little rough in some areas but overall not bad. Will be back and will recommend to others.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,I took me friend who is a beginner and felt very comfortable playing the course.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Deer Creek is a fun layout that challenges because of it's tree lined fairways and numerous water placements. Course was in good condition, and is quite scenic due to the many trees. Always love playing here and will definitely do so again!"
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Third time I played this course in last three years. The first things people will say about DC are usually not complimentary: Adjoining fairways increase the risk of getting hit by a ball and a couple of funky hole layouts. There is some truth to both comments, however I think it's a smokescreen. It's a challenging course with some tight fairways you can't afford to miss. The adjoining fairways are not that tight....it's the penalty for missing them that annoys people. Hole #2 should be redesigned. Either move the tee up so the water can be cleared from the tee or move it back and create a par 5. As it stands, a good tee shot ends up in the water. If short, you are looking at 200 yds uphill to the green. It is an annoying hole. Finally, it would be better if a first time player could play with someone who has played the course to help with where to hit your drive (#1 for instance), club selection (#4 for instance) and, in several cases, finding your way to the next tee. Course conditions were very good and I enjoyed my round."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"I've been playing at Deer Creek for the past 21 years. It's always in excellent condition and has many interesting hole layouts. It probably has a special place in my heart as it is where I made my only hole-in-one back on May 9th, 1997 on what is now #11."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,well cared for course fairways and greens were in great shape even with the rain very little standing water .
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Have played this course a decent amount of times prior, but never felt like I wanted to share my experience. The course has a good layout with the first couple of holes be very nice. Then you get to the middle of the course and everything seems congested. Basically if you don't hit the ball straight off the drive you're looking at a bogey or worse guaranteed. Back 9 spaces out well so overall it isn't bad in any means. Greens were in rough shape when I went this last time. Couple of any holes on some of them that made for annoying obstacles. Some of the tee boxes for par 3's were in really rough shape. For the hot deals price the course is worth it."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Fun to play. Some tight fairways and greens with lots of contour. Well worth the drive to get there.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Other than being penalized for hitting a good drive on 6 and 7, this is a beautiful course. Bent fairways, perfectly manicured greens, lots of trees and water, lovely sand all make it one of the best courses in central/southern Indiana. #17 is impossibly hard, unless you hit a perfect 210 yard drive. It's their signature hole. Course is 6600 yds. from the tips, which is where you should play from. As good a course as you can find anywhere."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"My boss left it up to me to find a course AND rent clubs for a recent trip to Indy. I found this gem mainly on being close to the airport. Contacted the course via email to see about possibility of rentals for both of us. When we arrived, the rental clubs had been assembled and ready for us to go. To our pleasure, the club were current versions and of great quality. The staff was extremely friendly and very helpful in getting us going."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"The course was in really good shape except for a couple of greens, which had been hit by some recent very heavy rains. Great views every turn you took and some challenging holes all around. We managed to squeeze in 18 holes in less than 4 hours and promise to return to this hidden gem again."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Oh, did I mention that with twilight rates AND rentals, it was only $44. We haven't hardly been able to play anywhere at any time for that amount and it usually didn't include rentals."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"My boss was so impressed with the rental set of Taylormades, that he came back to MN and traded his Ping's in for the same set - THANK YOU DEER CREEK"
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"We played this course on a day that they were aerating the greens so had to start on hole 15, which was no big deal, but this was my first time playing on ""freshly aerated"" greens which had just had the plug and dirt swept off. Made the greens extremely bouncy and impossible to get a good straight roll. My buddy said it was like playing the ""PLINKO"" game on the Price Is Right. Needless to say, being a poor putter to begin with, this made for a LONG round! Otherwise, the weather the day we played was PERFECT with low 80's, sunshine and low wind. Course was not overly crowded, and we were playing as a 3-some and only one time did we felt ""pushed"" by a single golfer who we invited to play through. I have played this course several times and find it to be VERY challenging for a novice golfer like me! It has water, sand, and some major elevation changes. (If you want to try hitting on downhill, and uphill lies, you WILL get your chance!) This course is very well kept, and is in a really nice quiet area West of Indianapolis. I would highly recommend anyone to play this course as it is fun, but unless you are a single digit handicap, don't expect to have your best score ever!:)"
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Good course will play again
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Little tight but only on 5 holes
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Staff was extremely helpful and the course was in great condition I would go again but it a little far for me.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Greens best I have played on this year . The fairways are as nice as Greens. Just a great place to play . Also had 3 Deer walked a cross of tee boxs we let them play thow !!
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Play this 18 holes great play
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Course good conditionSlow slow play
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Rough high, greens not bad for this time of year, generally fast."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,The course was extremely wet but still in good condition.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Played 3 times this year already, and the fairways and greens are in great shape! The bunkers are still like kitty litter rather than sand, but not terrible. Challenging 18 hole course west of indy."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,The course is beautiful and fun to play. It is a challenging course.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Perfect weather in late August. Course was in good shape, especially the greens."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Course is in awesome shape. Tee boxes, fairways, greens, even bunkers were obviously well tended to. Course layout was a little funky and got lost a time or 2 driving from hole to hole but overall very happy with the round. Would definitely recommend to others. Will be back."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,The course is a great value for the money. Was in excellent condition. Lots of variety in hole layout and the large greens have some subtle slopes that make them challenging.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,To play such a great coarse for under $20 I would take that deal every day
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Nice layout.goddess conditions in general.People are nice.Quite and no rush.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Everything about DC is outstanding except for the bunkers, which are basically fine gravel. Lots of tough holes for the average golfer; good challenge for the better golfer. Good prices, good value. Great practice area. We had an excellent deal through Golf Now for two players; third came along at the last minute. They could have charged the standard fee but instead gave the round for the same price for which we paid. Not expected but typical of the treatment given here. Will be back often!"
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Course in very good shape after heavy rains the previous day.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Quality course for the money. Played the gold tees. A few holes were very tough to navigate for someone playing it for first time.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Wish I had the $$$$ I would just get a membership. I love this place!!!!
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"I had not played here before. The course is in very good condition from tee to green. It is quite challenging with many blind tee shots, blind second shots, severe elevation changes, water and sand quite often in play. You will find yourself with quite a number of sidehill, uphill, or downhill lies. It is pretty hard. Overall, a real nice course."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,It was great want to play again and i will i love it Thanks very good coarse and in good shape and all of them was friendly will be back.Cleo Yarber
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,I have played this golf course at least 100 times since it opened up back in the 90s. It is a track with characteristics of those built in the 70s and 80s. It's not long the greens are mostly not elevated and you can run the ball up. Historically this golf course is always stayed green it is watered very well. My around this weekend was on the greenest golf course I've played all summer long.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Overall, fun course to play that is appropriately challenging. I agree with some reviews that there are some frustrating hole designs, but there are some also truly unique holes that are fun to play (#17). Played on a Monday, 25 dollars for as much golf as you can stomach. Can't beat it. I will be back to play again."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Course was great, weather was great, overall we had a good time and will be going back"
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"The weather was as gorgeous as the course. But hardly anyone was playing! The men's tees playover 400 yards on several of the par-fours, so it is a stretch for me, but I enjoyed the challenge.The second hole is the trickiest, because the pond , which isn't visible from the tee, is less than 200 yards away."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"I absolutely love to play this course! It is just challenging enough to make you think about key shots you have to make along the way.I also love the fact that on Mondays, you csn play all day for $25."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Staff allowed a foursome on course with only 2 sets of clubs so pace of play was horrible and no ranger.Speed of greens between front nine and back nine was night and day. The back nine was like putting on shag carpet. The rest of the course was in good shape.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"We got our tee time on line thru golfnow. We got to course early and the staff was very friendly and stated we could go right to tee box. We had a foursome so we let a twosome play thru and we had a great time. The course was in good shape, rough little high but not to bad. We will be back to play again."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"As always when we held our corporate functions there, the course and personnel made the play very pleasant."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,The terrain has some nice views with tree lined hills and valleys. Make sure you look at the scorecard for hints on the holes. Great value.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"I loved the rolling hills, and the course was in very nice condition. It was a great value for the money."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"We had an afternoon tee time with a great rate through GolfNow. The conditions were good, Tee boxes and fairways were above average and rough was consistent and thick. The greens were slow but overall not bad, the high amounts of ball marks were annoying as you could spot over a dozen on each hole that needed repaired. Overall we enjoyed the round despite the poor pace of play and the loud groups that were simultaneously listening to a nascar race, basketball game and music on the course."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,This is one the most beautiful course's that play. I don't get to play it as often as I'd like to because it is about an hour from my home but I plan on playing it more. The weather was rainy but the grounds crew were still out cutting grass and seeding the tee boxes. Just an absolutely wonderful golf course.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"You wouldn't expect much from a course with a Clayton, Indiana address, but this course is of postcard picture quality. Very challenging for the average golfer, most every hole requires an accurate tee shot. Also, the greens tend to be much much slower than the average golf course so 3 putting early could be commonplace. However, if its your first time playing the course, just put down the scorecard and enjoy a round of golf on a beautiful piece of land. A GolfNow user can usually find a good deal here often for under 20 bucks."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Deer Creek was in excellent shape for this early in the spring other courses we have played had a lot of damage form the hard winter. Deer Creek seemed to have avoided any major damage. Always a good place to play, the staff are friendly and Knowledgeable. I highly recommend Deer Creek Golf Course for a fun and challenging round. Best bang for the buck in Hendricks Co."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"This course is overpriced and unplayable for any golfer with skill playing any other well laid out golf course. Number 2 is a real joke and four of the par fours should be eliminated from play. The par threes are the only holes on the course that appear to have any design at all. You can hit a perfect drive and end up in the water or on a severe downhill slope shooting to a green that will never take a shot. Only guys with jeans and five somes play here and the key is to be a beginner or not really care what you shoot. This is without a doubt, the worst laid out golf course in Indiana. There are so many wet spots that the carts have to be kept on the cart path. Worm holes are more abundant than grass on the greens and the fairways are covered with leaves/ SAVe your money this course is a joke and populated by farmers and guys who just want to own golf clubs. This course will never be fun to play and just frustrate you from learning how to play a real course. Compare this place to a wooded cornfield with too many hills to plow."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Thought the course was in great shape for the middle of October. Staff was great. The course was practically empty, it was rainy, windy and cold. Had never played the course before. My only complaint were the four parallel par 4's and there too many par fours that you had to lay up on because of hazards or other trouble. Do not like having to hit iron off the tee then having hybrids in. Nothing against the course just personally don't enjoy that."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,The front nine is the tough part of the course. The fairways are very narrow and not forgiving as it is engulfed with trees on both sides. The back nine are a lot more relaxed and forgiving and I found a lot easier. The course was in need of mowing as in the rough it was very easy to lose balls. I understand that they have had a lot of rain recently and that might be the problem along with some leaves on top of the grass in the rough also. The greens and tee boxes were in good shape.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Nice course. Tight, could use better cart path markings. Hard to find certain holes. Lot of wood, so hit straight, or bring balls."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Tough for an older golfer (long) but a fun challenge
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Played this course yesterday morning. The staff was very friendly and the course was in pretty good shape (most ball marks repaired, no debree on the fairways or greens, sand traps were nicely raked). My only complaint is that the mowing crews were prevalent all day and it was difficult to find a flat spot to tee off from on a few holes. Overall it's a good course for the money."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"great shape, had challenging holes would play again this year"
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Overall course was in very good shape, tee boxes, fairways, bunkers and greens. Three quarters of the course is fairly tight with trees and water with a good layout overall, a fair challenge from the back tees. A Great course for the value thru Golfnow.com..."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,With the drought that we have had the course was in good shape...Will play there again without a doubt...
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"This course is odd. It is well maintained. The staff were friendly and accommodating. The overall experience was good. That being said, the course is tricked up. There are several holes that require repeated knowledge of the course in order to play them well."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,I would recommend this course with the caveat that they will be frustrated with some weird angles and hidden obstacles.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,enjoyable course with greens and fairways in good shape. much work has been done this year in continuing to keep course in great shape. challenging 18 holes and well worth the money spent through Golf Now tee times.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Beautiful views, great club house, very well kept fairways, medium fast greens, but I found the design of the course itself was sorely lacking. Confusing cart paths, congested tee areas caused by clustered tees. Such a shame because its an absolutely gorgeous course that is a total pain to play. Always having to watch for players crossing near your fairway is a constant distraction. My best guess is this course was laid out by a landscaping company and not a course designer. Really a poor layout for good flow. My only complaint with the physical grounds is the Tee boxes are mostly domed affairs which shows a lack of attention to detail and engineering. I think it is a beautiful, well kept course with great staff, but I won't be playing it again because I don't enjoy having to continually wait for players on other fairways to be out of harms way before I hit, and I don't like having to duck incoming balls."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Challenging course with a nice scenery. I like how they maintain the course, never sen it in poor condition. Can't beat the price!"
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"The course that is splendid except oneAnyway, that means that there are many players.Only it may be proof with the popularity, but is annoying to me.It is awesome, and waiting time is long every hall."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Found this course due to me and some friends heading towards southwest Ind and wanted to make a pit stop, and thanks to some reviews on golfnow glad we gave it a try. Course isn't real long and some holes are tight next to others but outside of that the course was in great condition and it made for a fun play. If I was on the westside more often would come here more frequently."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Fun course to play. Mature and well groomed. Like the many changes in the terrain.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"The course is very well maintained. Smooth greens and trimmed fairways. However, the tee boxes and greens are literally right next to each other on most holes. The chatter from other groups and the worry of being hit by a stray ball from the other holes detracts from the smooth greens and fairways. This course is dangerous with its parallel holes. It was money well spent but I will not recommend."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"For Plainfield and surrounding, there are two choices for a quick 18 holes of golf. One is a Pete Dye design and the other is actually a decent golf course. (...see what I did there?) Deer Creek stands alone as a fun place to play with awesome fairways and greens, a friendly staff and a comfortable clubhouse. However, where it really starts to shine is when you compare it to Oak Tree Golf Course down the road. With fairways that play like my backyard, and a staff that is as friendly as a group of rabid badgers, this ""Pete Dye"" layout is an absolute dump. If Dye somehow decided to visit, he would probably change his name and move out of the country."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"When we played Deer Creek this week, the staff saw us pull into the lot and brought our cart right to the truck so we could load up. They remember who we are and we always feel like valued customers. The course is always in great shape and we always know where we can find a great golf experience right down the road. If you haven't made it out to Clayton to play here...it's your loss."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Fairly far from the city but is a beautiful course with plenty of trees, bunkers, water and a few hills. Doesn't handle rain particularly well but a great course to play."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Play here alot. Course is well maintained & always green.Staff is friendly. Snack bar & shop area clean along with restrooms.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,We enjoyed the experience and will play Deer Creek again.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Nice layout, surprisingly hilly for central Indiana. Course is very well maintained. Staff was friendly. I will definitely come back!"
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"I have golfed here twice now and it's a treat, beautiful coarse, challenging to all levels."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,"Although there was some intital confussion with the tee time booking, the staff was very friendly and somewhat accomodating. The play however was very slow, and our group ran out of time to finish all 18 holes. There was no ranger on the course to monitor play, and subsequently our wait at some holes were up to 20 to 25 minutes."
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Great day of golf inspite of the cold windy conditions.
Deer Creek Golf Club,522-deer-creek-golf-club,Scorecards with tips for each hole helps for first timers. Fast greens have a feel of a true championship course. I liked that it has a little of everything traditional and links some hills and valleys not my favorite style but very playable.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Always a good time here. Course was in good shape. Had a blast
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"One of the best courses in Hendricks County. Great layout with doglegs both ways & a fair amount of hazards. Greens are in great shape and a can be a challenge if the superintendent wants to be tough 😉. The best course for the value that I’ve played in a while, get out there you can, you won’t be disappointed."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Great layout, great conditions, fast true and challenging greens. Very nice large practice area and range. does not disappoint."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,course in good shape given dry conditionspin placements were ridiculous given speed of greens. several holes cut on the slope would simply not hold a ball. do not have a mickey mouse imogee but would use one here. do not understand why tee times are made and you arrive 20 minutes early and a giant cluster of people meet you on the first tee box. cluster defined as 20 or more. again. unacceptable. I guess this was mournful Monday rather than wacky wednesday.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Greens have been super fast and challenging the last few times I’ve been here. Every aspect of the course has been great this year, especially for the cost!"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Greens were quick and rolled true but at times the pin placements were very close to the edge of the green. As an example I was in the swale on #1 15 feet away and putting downhill but putted it off the green and missed the six-footer coming back off the fringe. So a .GIR two putt bogey, LOL. Six more three putts en route to a 79. Hopefully the course fixes the sprinkler issue on 17! Works on the tee boxes and cart paths and overseeds some of the rough around the greens. Great staff and layout."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,The course was in great shape other than the tee boxes. Some of the tees were really chewed up and not just on the par 3’s. I would definitely play again.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"I play this course regularly and am a big fan…challenging and usually in very good shape. However, pace of play during this last round was HORRENDOUS…almost 5 1/2 hours!"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"In all fairness, first time I personally experienced this type of slow play at Twin Bridges (but read a couple reviews from others experiencing the same). Hopefully, this latest round was simply a perfect storm occurring on this particular day. Could be a potential problem if it’s a continuing trend."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Very good course. However, avoid any good now deals or their wild Wednesday deal. They tend to stack up tee times/people. Took up 4 hours to play 9 holes. I gave up after 11. Its ridiculous."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"I understand they have to make money, but come on.. There should be some consideration for pace of play."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"I’ve played this course quite a few times. It’s got some challenging holes with tree lined fairways, lots of tricky tee shots, and some great looking greens.I do however run into issues with pace. The last 3 of 4 times I’ve run into some backups of multiple groups. I know it happens at times and the clubhouse can only do so much, but if it continues to be a consistent thing I will likely look for another course to play more often. Also, my 5 year old says it’s the most fun he’s had in his life, so there’s his review."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,The course was in pretty good condition. We always have fun playing this course.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,The course is in good condition with plenty of length and challenges.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Course was in good shape except for a few of the tee boxes. Overall, a nice experience."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,First time playing this course. Found a new favorite course and defiantly favorite layout! Front nine is carved out of the hill and hollers perfectly! Back nine is more of a link feel pretty open. Staff is super friendly and makes you feel welcome! A few challenging holes but for the most part it's wide fairways. Tee to green the course is fantastic! Great food as well!
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,I thought the Twin Bridges golf course was very nice. Well worth playing. The hilly terrain is not something you see every day.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,The 3rd hole is just a bad hole and cutting down a few trees down the right side would help. I am rarely Iin favor of cutting trees but it is needed. Leveling some of the tee boxes would also help. Hitting an 8 iron off an uphill lie to a par three encourages a pull. Greenside hazards are in great shape. Fairway hazard ms should be filled in.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,greens rolling nicely and fairways rolling .conscious effort to improve bunker play. only issue would be areas around various greens could use some tlc
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,There are a few tee boxes that need more airflow and sun and lack a lot of grass. The greens ran true and were not slow and pace of play was good. Yhe fairways are in very good shape but the rough can be a bit sparse.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,greens were nice and rolli g fairly well. only drawback back is player I difference to fixing g ballmarks. fairways well cut and most rough playable. few drainage stops and bunkers not very good.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Pros:Man behind counter very niceTee box’s good, a couple spottyFairways very goodRough cut at fair levelGreens same as practice greenGreens cut to fair length and same speedBunkers most in good shapeSome unpleasant lack of sandConsNothing worthy of a comment"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Great course layout some tough holes with narrow fairways, but fair horse condition was excellent"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Course layout is fun. Needs a little attention on greens. Shop manager is rude and condescending. Needs to upgrade the personality.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Course is usually in good shape. It was ok. Staff needs to be more friendly. Act like you are bothering them. More people would return if they were treated like customers.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,The way this course is maintained for the price is unmatched. Has become my favorite course over the past 2 years.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"actually loved the layout, a few funky holes but overall a great public layout imo"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,My only disappointment was no womens apparel. The tea was the best.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"I enjoy playing this course and my only want is for them to have a ranger. That said, I know at most courses that’s a luxury. Great course, range and practice area."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Nice routing and good variety of holes that are narrow and heavily wooded for the most part. Provides a real challenge by forcing you to be super accurate from the tee. Lots of elevation changes throughout the course which provides some nice views. Fairways and greens were pure. I’d play here more often if it wasn’t an hour drive.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Almost everything was in very good shape. There are a few tee boxes that need some TLC and I wish the course would remove some trees so the boxes could get some sun. The bunkers need some more sand around the greens but they are after all hazards. We played pick and replace since they are not manicured this time of year.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Played this on a Friday and it was a beautiful, well-kept course. Our tee time was 10am and sprinklers were left on a little too long, so the front 9 was pretty wet, but by the time it was pretty dry for the back 9."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Some of the holes have a beautiful lifted view on top of a hill as you drive on to a wide open fairway below.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"You'd be hard pressed to not like this trace. Great layout and plenty of room for those shot that go alittle left or right.There are some issues with a few of the tee boxes that appear to have little to no right done with them this entire season. Some work also needs done on the steep slopeing sides of the fairway on #2 (no grass or very little) then #17 mud rock wash coming fown the hill so balls that hit this area didn't have good outcomes like the other 3 players i got paired with.This is the 6th time I've played the course this year with 3 of those times using Teeoff app. I like this course and drive just over an hour to play because of the layout, value and pace. But hopefully next season will see more improvements as I'm seeing some long overdue work in the bunkers.Play the course even with the small things I've noted your enjoy the round. Greens can be very tough given their slope too."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,We always have a fantastic time playing here. The course was in excellent shape!
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,It was sooo crowded but still had a great time
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Booked through GolfNow on 7/2 for a 7/3 tee time. Understand holiday golf will be busy, but upon finishing 1st hole, get to the second tee to find out 4 groups are backed up and have been waiting over an hour to play the hole (on pace for 7-8 hrs) Course clearly is not spacing out tee times, cramming people on without any care for pace of play, just happy to take money. Asked for a rain check as no one should be waiting an hour+ on any tee, were told that is something course cannot do for GolfNow bookings. Course is still making money, should be more aware of pace of play and starting times for golfers. Will not return if this cannot be worked out."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Pace of play over 5 hoursNo ranger4 some2 someA Single hitting 2 balls at timesUs a 2 some,no one behind us at first teecourse got backed up so bad(8) yes (8) groups on 16 and 17 🤬To bad too course in pretty good shape"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Pace of play is awful, fairways are supposed to be rewarding and it’s like hitting off of mud. The last 4-5 rounds I’ve played have been 5-6 hour rounds. Greens are fast and firm but very ugly"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"My review from 1 to 10Slow play 5 hour roundCourse fees 9 out of 10Greens smooth ,consistency good, but very firmFairways 8 out of 10Rough 8 out of tenTee box’s. 7 out of tenBunkers that have been repaired 9 out of 10Cart paths 7 out of tenClubhouse personnel 10 out of 10Biggest issue no water or drink cart on course"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"This course is tough but fair. It’s definitely in the shape you would consider a central Indiana course to be in this time of year, meaning some patchiness here or there which could result in a bad lie but greens and tee boxes in great shape. Paid 25 for 18 holes and that’s a steal."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Great course for the value, a bit busy but totally understandable on a beautiful spring day."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,One of our favorite courses. The staff is great and the course is fantastic. We love playing here
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Seeing a lot of course improvements on:Cart paths, bunkersGreens very goodFairways very goodSome tees are being lost,that are in shade all day.Bunkers getting better every time I play hereWish they had a bunker at rangePlay little slow over 41/2 hrs 😡"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"It was scary trying putt !Great layout !Tee boxes were ruff, It did not matter to me ( you tee it up and hit )Sand bunkers were good.A very good course !"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Course was is good condition with the exceptions of parts they were working on. Greens in great shape, layout was nice not a dog track, and the course really fits my eye. This might not be the case for all golfers but I found it to be a good chance to score low if you can get up and down. (unlike me 3 putting everything) Still might be my next membership."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Course conditions have declined over the years. Course has such a great layout and could be one of the best courses in the state of Indiana if conditions improved dramatically! So sad to see this course in this condition.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"First time with the groupGuys could not be nicer to new guyNow the course conditionsShop staff very professionalPlayed Senior tee box’s, all cutSome other tee box’s sparse of any grassFairways solid in grass but cut tightRough fair height in most area’sGreens very quick but smoothDue to many pin placements could not stop ballIf going down hill at all,Beware stay below holeMost bunkers have been worked on & have sandCan see that cart paths are in progress22$ Was a steal"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Always enjoy this course. Greens are a bit of a challenge but fun. Definitely recommend this course
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"The overall value of this place is unbeatable. Wednesday's 22$ w/cart rate is phenomenal. This was my first round at Twin Bridges, in preparation for a tournament being hosted at the location in two weeks. The staff was friendly and welcoming. The other players were mindful of pace and as a single I was offered more than once to play through by multiple groups. The course is challenging (I'm an 8 handicap) and the greens require thoughtful approach. The condition was decent considering we are in the middle to late summer season, but thats what I would expect from a public course with great rates. I can see this course going onto my regular season rotation around the state."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,greens were quick. fairways good. tee boxes were a major concern. played behind a twosome but in 3 hours.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,The course was in bad shape since last fall when I played it.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"First time playing Twin Bridges - very nice course was in great shape, pace of play was good only had to wait a few holes, then opened up to maintain pace. Very friendly staff - Wednesday play deal $22 with cart great rate for 18 holes very nice layout - some great challenging holes. Would recommend it to any golfer."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Probably the best course I’ve played on this year. It was in awesome shape, new carts, and the staff was friendly."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Yes I would recommend this course. Great value and reasonably priced.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Greens & fairways in good condition . Pace of play was good as well .
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"The course is challenging with several unique hole designs and fast heavily sloped greens. However, it is your standard rural course in terms of upkeep and pace of play. The conditions were better than pace of play, and neither conditions nor pace were horrible, just could’ve been better. All in all, it’s a darn good deal for the price and will challenge any golfer."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Course was in terrible shape. Greens crisp and dry. Would not hold and in desperate need of water. Pace was very slow and cart paths are falling apart. Several bunkers had no sand and full of weeds. If they don’t water those greens they will loose them.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Nice layout, nice fairways and greens are in pretty good shap. Lots of undulating fairways and greens. Pace of play was HORRIBLE!!"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Such a fun course with a challenging layout! Couldn’t beat the price for 18 holes on a weekday! The course was in decent shape, nothing amazing and nothing terrible. Greens could use some work. Just a word of caution, stay away from the woods. They are very unforgiving and will steal all of your balls lol"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Even with it being early November the course played really well. Drives were getting roll. Greens were smooth. Been wanting to play the course for over a year.Now that I have, we will definitely be back."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"I have only played this course twice, and this is my first review for any course. Granted I have only played this course twice and both in October."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"The condition of the course is in great condition, fairways very playable roughs are very well kept and the greens are fast. If you miss hit a chip onto the green you will pay for it."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"When I arrived for my tee time the second round of play they were under a 30-40 min freeze delay. I was a single player behind the men's club and 2 other 3 some's they ask me if I wanted to start on the front nine to get started closer to my time. the front was still under freeze closure. that was very appreciated. When i came up on other groups they were very nice and let me play thru, that doesn't happened very much anymore."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Just all around a very relaxed atmosphere, very rare anymore."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Thanks guys will be out there more often.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Course was in fair shape for late in the season. Holes were challenging but rewarding for well placed shots. Signage was poor at tee boxes so was difficult figuring yardage.Pace was a little slow although the two some in front offered us to play through. We declined as slower play seems to be the norm at this course and the foursomes in front of them didn't seem in any hurry. The 2 of us played 18 in 4 1/2 hours so it wasn't unbearable but frustrating when we waited on a group who refused to tee off because there was a foursome on the green on a par 5. Come on, you are NOT Tiger Woods!"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Gave date and time if anyone at Course monitors reviewPlaying eighth hole, trying to playi second shotsInto green, a grounds person watering green had hose across front of green. At no time did he try and remove it so we could have access to the green. He had watered so much, he had over watered so much ,puddles had formed, putting was not possible towards hole from my position on green. Have played 50 years and never seen a grounds person be so rude to players. Spoke to Group in front of us and had same issues.Why is this not being monitored by head groundskeeper?"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"I am not a golf snob, I'll play most anywhere, and not complain. When you pull up to the 2nd tee, and 5 groups are waiting, well that's just not right. After 13 holes and 5 hrs. We called it a day."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,I found this course a great challenge! The layout is wonderful with no gimmicky holes. You have to think your way around and it never gets boring! I have played 15 to 20 different courses since my move to the area and this is now my favorite course. I can't wait to play here again!!!
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,had a single in front of us and a twosome in front of him. the twosome never let the single through and there was not one in from of the twosome. we let the single behind us join our twosome. I called pro shop and B.G. the pro said that he doesn't have time to get out there right now but if he has time he will. Never saw him out there. waited every shot till hole 12 when I finally went up to the twosome and told them to play faster. After this prompting we played freely the rest of the way.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Been a log jam all day, and it doesn’t seem like it’s that crowded other than that, it’s always enjoyable here."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,First time on course and really enjoyed layout. Challenging but funOnly issue as with most is the fact the greens were pitted with ball marks not being fixed by others
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Course has a wide variety of holes that require different types of shots. Tight driving holes, open driving holes, elevated tees, elevated greens. Very nice course and fairly priced. Great value!!"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"ProsGreens smooth rolled all the same speedFairways good, a little tightRough fair in most placesBunkers coming aroundConsCart paths still not very goodPace of play somewhat slowPeople playing wrong tees for abilityCourse charging 1$ a bottle for water on courseBring your own"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"If you get the chance pick here. The course is beautiful and challenging, but not impossible for an average player."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Greens little firm but not to fast very consistentFairways good but cut tightBunkers coming around but amount of sand inconsistent, so my playing partner told meShot 80 with 3 double bogeys not bad for 70 years youngThere’s my review for 6/13"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Lots of good holes. Some tight,some open,greens slow and hard,need water.Made tee time online for 12:50 - teed off at 1:35. I checked in at 12:40 said what my tee time was and name . Had to wait on carts. We got bumped because back because they did not keep track of us.Very poor way to do business ! So we teed off after the group who had a 1:30 tee time.The course offered no recourse .Our drive was over an hour long.Pretty disappointed.Bill GregoryGreenwood, IndianaMy son lives in Noblesville"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Very challenging layout ! Fast ,smooth greens !Too bad !I really enjoy this course !Bill GregoryGreenwood IN."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Always in great shape, a great layout and a great staff. I would definitely recommend playing here if you get the chance."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"I have played Twin Bridges many times and this most recent round was no exception. Course conditions were perfect minus normal fairway iron pelts that will be found anywhere. Bunkers are pristine minus maybe 1 or 2 which is a big plus. Soft sand that you dont have to drop out of and are strategically placed to make the golfer have decision shots. Greens are well kept and played a at a very well pace, not too fast, not too slow. I would, and have, highly recommend this course to golfers of all skill levels. Driving range is nice as well although I've only ever driven by it. Full service bar is always a good thing to have too. One of the better course in Indiana regardless of price but price is very fair!"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Pros: great course layout, conditions, bunkers, etc. many visually appealing holes from tee boxes, great money value, and challenging without being overly difficult (speaking as a ~25 handicap)"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Cons: carts are usually slower than average
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Coarse is in great condition , ball washers out with new towels & speed of play was above average ."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Greens very niceFairways starting to fill inTraps a mess for most part as usualCart paths terrible25$ cart and green fee fair price
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,worst course for failing to repair ball marks. shame on players. tee boxes fairly well beat up as well. greens otherwise were quick and rolled as true as they could.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"I had a buddy who was running extremely late. Packed course due to a beautiful day, but the staff were great with changing our tee time and fitting us in later on. The staff were extremely friendly and the course played great. Hole locations on the greens were pretty challenging, but that just makes the short game more interesting!"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Course is tough but fair - greens were very firm, rolled true and fast!"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Bunkers need work but management said that is coming soon - great hidden gem!

Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Been playing here several years.Typically great shape and challnging.Bunkers need work and greens very fast.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Course is not in bad shape, cart path needs some help as well as the sand traps. Staff is friendly and helpful. Will play it again"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Fairways goodGreens very hard and fastBut smoothDo not get above hole if possible
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Have played course since spring 15-20 timesCourse maintenance has taken a huge downturnIn a drought and they have over watered fairwaysStanding water in fairways and greens just oppositeWill not hold a wedgeHave greens cut so close that if you roll it up a hillIt rolls back if shortBunkers still mostly in playableTo bad nice layout
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Made an online reservation as a single. Other group, same tee time, coordinated by phone with the pro shop to bring a foursome. I was pushed out, with no other good options. When I asked to be comped for a round (my day was now trashed), the pompous little manager accused me of trying to ""work them.,"" when the only thing I had ""worked"" was my personal schedule so that I could ply a round of golf."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Shortsighted management. Rather than a mollified customer, they now have an angry one. And this was the second time in a year that I've experienced this sort of mismanagement at this course. ."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Disappointed in some the course bunker situation. They need to be repaired...dry and hard...unplayable. Some tee area bald,etc. Still love playing course and Tee time deal made it worthwhile."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,I enjoy playing this course. The front 9 is TOUGH! I wish the people who played here would fix their ball marks on the greens. All of them look like they have chickenpox. I fix 5-10 ball marks on every green every time I play. Sand traps are HORRIBLE. The few that have sand have big rocks. My group plays EVERY trap as ground under repair. Several of the tee boxes have NO GRASS. Fairways are good. Greens put well.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"The staff was completely helpful and welcoming, there is a nice driving range available with plenty of distance between golfers as to not get distracted. The greens and fairways are the best part of this golf course. The greens ran true and quick --rolled well. The bunkers are getting worked on and improving. The course to me was very challenging playing from the gray tees approx. 6300 yds give or take. Need to drive the ball well and stay away from trouble spots. There are plenty of tee options so you can adjust the course distance. the layout of the course is great with many elevation changes which adds a great variety of shot making. I recommend playing this course and will be back in the future. pace of play was a concern but they did have an outing on the weekend."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Bunkers not playableHigh Crab grass taking over some tee box’sIf not for price and layout would play elsewhereneeds maintenance Most everywhere but greens
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"If you can play for $20-25 it is a decent course for the money. I would not pay over that. Many of the bunkers are unplayable, and since the last time I played, about 2 weeks ago, the tee boxes have deteriorated significantly. Many tee boxes have been overtaken with crabgrass and some are terrible. The greens are decent, but have a lot of unrepaired ball marks. Problem with this course is they get a lot of play from people who have no respect for the game....don't repair ball marks on green or repair divots in fairway. Management could do more to try and get golfers to show some respect for the course, but it seems they don't really care either."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,For this time of the year course was in very good shape. Play was a little slow but many golfers were on the course. The staff was very polite and helped if any was needed. I would definitely recommend this course.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Course layout is nice.Greens fast and true.80 percent of the bunkers are bad.Fix them or just grow grass would rate it a 5 star.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Enjoy playing here. Also like the fact that the women’s tees are in good shape. Definitely recommend
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Greens excellentFairways excellentBunkers 75% unplayable
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,This time of you where it has been so dry this course was in excellent shape
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Course in good shape overall, except Some bunkers"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Always love playing here. Very hot day so play was a little slow, but we really enjoyed our round. Great layout!"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,A really enjoyable day on the links at Twin Bridges! It’s a great layout with undulating fairways which are well cut and greens that have a quick true pace. Cart paths could use a bit of repaving and tee markers could be clearer as some whites are “shared” with either yellow or grey.. course workers are active which is a great sign. I’ll be back soon!!
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"People in club house always friendly and courteousNew add on red/ white/ blue pin position flags Very nice touchHard to beat course layout.Again clubhouse personnel are second to none, seem happy to see you every time we play."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,ProsGreens roll excellent to putt and chipFairways well cutTee box’s cut
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"ConsMost Bunkers Bad, But crews out filling with sandMost pin placements in set on very tough positions due to undulationsSome uncut areas of rough, may be due to rain in last few days"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,This was our first time playing the course and it didn’t disappoint. Dog legs both ways and varying distances force you to use every club in your bag. Change of elevation added excitement to a couple of tee shots and the course was in good shape. Can’t wait to go back!
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"ProsGreens roll true 1 thru 18Fairways very goodRough demanding due to lengthGrass on Range good shapeFlag sticks in, but fair sleeves in hole below top of holeConsMost bunkersCould use red/ white/ blue flags on greens to mark front- middle -rear due to size of greens"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Twin Bridges has an interesting layout, with some elevation change and greens that have a decent amount of slope/undulation in them. Used my whole bag playing it today. Really liked holes 2-4. Several holes require well-placed tee shots to get through some openings. Was a very interesting design that I enjoyed a lot. Reminded me a bit of West Chase and Rock Hollow."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Only issue was the conditions left a little to be desired. A few greens were being plugged and patched. And the fairways/rough were not always consistent. Some bunkers were redone, others were a mess."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Well worth a go if you're on there west side of Indy.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"I play Twin Bridges all the time since I live pretty close but it’s my favorite course in the Indy area. It’s very challenging especially with the wind howling and the greens as fast as they were Saturday. Everything was in great condition except for the bunkers but that’s pretty typical on a lot of courses these days during “the shutdown”. It’s hard to find a better layout with elevation changes, fast greens and beautiful scenery to boot. Will definitely continue to play here!"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Really beautiful and challenging course. Always enjoy my time on the course.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"The course was nice, layout was decent and it wasn't too crowded. The carts were a little janky, gas but quite slow, lots of taped windshields and places where balls had broken through. The cart paths had lots of potholes but they had a crew out there repaving many sections while we played so clearly they are working on it. The ground was very hard when I played so balls were bouncing all over the place, but it wasnt too bad to find them usually. The greens are VERY tough here. Lots of breaks, lots of downhill or uphil putts, lots of very long greens. I had a very tough time getting putts to go in, lots of lipped putts. Pace of play was OK, we did get stuck behind a foursome or two and they had no intention of letting us play through, but we passed them on the turn and didn't see anyone else for a while. Overall good experience, would give it another try for sure."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Fun course and very well maintained. I used to play a lot when I was younger and played several courses this is by far one of my favorites
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Several tees were Relatively hard, but most were in very good shape. Fairways and greens were all well maintained and challenging. Golfed on a 90degree day and was impressed with plenty of opportunities for sitting in the shade when pace of play had us waiting slightly. Would definitely go here again."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Clubhouse amenities were minimal.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Overall the course condition was even better than I expected it to be! The fairways rough and greens were all pretty immaculate! The sand traps were the only part significantly lacking. Most were under construction or were so filled with water and/or rocks that you could not hit out of them! The facilities and staff were great! The only other fault I would give it is there were almost no stations to wash balls off on the course and no on course water at all! Overall I enjoyed the course and will likely play it again!
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Pros:Greens excellent, plenty of undulationFairways excellent but cut tightTee areas goodDriving range good grass, mostly good ballsCons:Bunkers need work but early in season, some unplayableRough a little high in spots, but weather probably the reason"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,The course is great exp for the hot deal price. But this is the worst marked course I have ever played!
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Course has a very good layout and modern undulating greens. Course takes full advantage of the land and elevation changes. The bunkers are being aggressively abandoned and that is sad. However all of the other positives outweigh this.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"On a cold damp Tuesday afternoon this course played long, but was in great shape considering we had a torrential downpour just a couple days before. Greens were smooth and tee boxes were in great shape. Fairways were closely mowed and leaves had been blown off fairways and greens."
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,Very nice course. Between US 36 and US 40 off the beaten path. Played it with my daughter a junior golfer. Nice fairways and greens. Changes in elevation keep it interesting. Snack bar had good food at the turn.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,The sand bunkers should be called mud bunkers. The rough was very high. The cost is higher than other courses around.
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"Twin bridges is by far the best course in the area. Fantastic value, challenging yet playable. Course condition is always great, fairways are lush, greens are fast and true. definitely a hidden treasure. Only wish they had a on course ranger"
Twin Bridges Golf Club,5702-twin-bridges-golf-club,"I really liked this course and the mens group that was playing there were are very nice guys. I was thinking of purchasing a season pass and will probably do so. course was in great shape, staff were very nice. my cart had no power (electric) and could hardly make it up the hills. Called the clubhouse and they met me at the next tee box with a new cart and even move my bag over to the new cart while we were teeing up. so all of this adds up to ""good""? Well I reserve great for courses that make me go wow. so, really nice laid back friendly staff and a nice course."

The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,played the two oldest 9 holes. had not played course in a couple of years. thought greens rolled very well as well as fairways. no complaints.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,This course is always very well maintained. It’s a fun course for all level of golfers. Place of play has not been an issue. I’ll definitely be back.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,We played in three hours and 45 minutes. The greens were in excellent condition even though there had been rain recently. This course always plays well and holds up very well when many other courses are cartpath only or closed.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Course is in good shape. Pace was slow on first 9 and then fast on the second. We didn’t feel welcome on the course though. None of the people we encountered made us feel like they wanted us there. Plenty of other options so I doubt we are back anytime soon.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"The fairways were in great shape. The greens were in great shape, the rough would penalize you"
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Great winter golf at the Legends. Ron the starter was very accommodating.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Fairways was in great shape, green are in great shape, the rough would make you pay a price"
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Numerous challenges, but not terribly difficult. Course was in great condition as always. You will enjoy your round IF you play the right tees."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,we played The Legends on a windy Nov. day. there are a lot of new houses(with new OB). Course in very good condition. Everyone was great to us.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"I'll never play The Legends Golf Club again. The starter was very rude to me and my guest, his treatment of customers is not acceptable. I run a small business and if any of my employees ever spoke to a customer, the way we were treated by the starter, I'd fire them on the spot. I've played too many public courses and some fantastic private courses around Indy to ever have to put up with a rude starter, and I just won't accept rude treatment when I'm the customer. This starter didn't ask us to move our cart, he could have easily said excuse me sir, do you mind moving or even said ""please"", but NO, he skipped polite asking nicely or even asking at all and went straight to giving orders/ commands, demands telling us to move our cart and when I looked at him in disbelief as he came flying up to us, he then goes onto say: ""I'll have your privileges taken away."" The only thing I said to him the entire time he was barking orders at us was that I don't want to ever play here again. I told him our tee time and we left. I paid for 2 rounds on golfnow but that's fine at least golfnow gets something, I like to support good companies. So, I went home and picked up my son and we went to a different course to hit balls, chip, and putt and enjoy the beautiful day. I was happy I even had time to mow the grass so the day wasn't wasted. So many great choices for golf around central Indiana to ever waste your time and money going to The Legends Golf Club. I've got a few buddies with similar experiences here also with a mean / nasty range/ starter, maybe it's time they look into this and hire some new folks that treat Customers with a smidge of respect. I'll be 100% sure to tell everyone I play with in the two golf leagues I play in and the other league I sub in, as well as, my weekend group I play with about my experience at The Legends Golf Club, I think I have a complete email list also to all the members at Old Oakland Golf Club too from when I was a member there, but I doubt they'd care about a public course like The Legends, but I'll let them know too just in case. Play anywhere besides The Legends Golf Club is my best advice for every and All Golfers!"
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Nice balance of challenging holes and gettable holes! Water, elevation and bunkers are well placed and demand consideration"
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"27 holes of golf, all well cared for. Practice facilities are top notch. Not very difficult but scores have to be earned. I enjoyed playing here for third time this year."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Always enjoy playing the Legends.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,The course is always in great shape and a pleasure to play.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Don't come to this place unless you are super good at golfing. We played in a reasonable pace as amateurs, but we were rushed on every holes by the ranger. When we finished 9 holes, the ranger told us that we have to finish the 9 holes in two hours, otherwise, he is going to remove us from the course. We felt this is rude. We paid to play the course as friends together, just for a relaxed game and having some fun. This course is definitely not for that. Stay away from it."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,You can always count on this course being in good shape.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"I live an hour north of Legends, but I was happy that I made the drive. Great Pete Dye layout, friendly staff, and friendly people on the course. It is still early in the year and the grasses are not active and growing, but the course is in great shape and the greens are very nice considering the time of the year. I’ll be back."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,it’s still technically winter here. Had a good time and would play again here but summer prices are a little crazy. The staff was very nice and helpful.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,The 27 hole regulation course has some wonderful undulating greens. The middle and road 9 have housing on several holes. The creek 9 has no housing and some rolling terrain.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,The Dye Course has abandoned the back 9 on its par 3 course.

We drive back then he tells usto join another twosome, who are in separate carts, what a way to start the round. What a cluster F—-kWon’t be back. Not worth the drive."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Loved the choice of tees. Love the lack of blind shots. It is all in front of you.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"27 holes available, reasonably priced, and terrific greens. Sign me up. It was a bit windy (like it normally is out here in the converted corn field), so scores suffered, but what a great track given the location. Not a bunch of up and down terrain, but most greens are elevated, there is a water hazard (penalty area now I guess) that comes into play on almost every hole. No duplication or similar holes at all. My favorite, although it isn’t the original 18, is the Creek 9. Normally in better shape, has the hardest par 3, par 4 and par 5 back-to-back-to-back on the whole 27 (IMO). Numbers 2, 3, and 4 will eat your lunch if the wind is blowing from the North! So much fun here, and the people are great."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,I will play here again. And again.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Great time, course was in great shape. Pace of play was a little slow, but not bad, about 4 1/2 hours. Tee boxes could be in better shape, green were fair to good. Fairways and rough were well maintained. Overall, great round for the money."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Ranger told us on 3 occasion to pickup the pace. When the group in front us wasn't clear for us to hit. The Rangers needs to identify were the problem is before ask a group to pickup pace. This was a extremely disappointing day of golf.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Paired up as a single force to ride with a strangeror pay additional $16 for separate cart. Round took 4:45 and didn’t see first ranger. Not going back.Greens need a lot of work .
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,It was raining when we got there. But the entire staff was very friendly. The course was beautiful. And it quit raining about the ninth hole. The sun came out and it was a great day
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Had some unseasonal warm weather on new years eve so we decided to enjoy a final round of golf in 2021. The course was very wet in areas but considering the weather in previous days it was actually in great shape. The greens were perfect and the tee boxes were good as well. Pace was fast and we had no issues at all. If you want a fun course with plenty of differing holes you should try the Legends!
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,The course was in great shape for December. I lost my driver cover and my phone and they had them the next day.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Shaggy gon sneeze. Get em wet shaggy. Bet you want to make a big ol sandwich.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"The course was in good to great condition, especially considering the recent lack of rain. The fairways and greens were in good condition. The tees were a little hard, but not bad. There was a foursome a couple of groups in front of use that was really slow. So we did some waiting on a lot of the holes. It was really hot, and it would have been nice if there was complimentary tap water with ice in insulated cups available. They did have complimentary water with ice in the club house. But the cups were small, and not insulated (paper). My ice lasted about two holes."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"We enjoyed the round; course is challenging and well-taken care of. Only complaints is that they put us with two other golfers with a very limited vocabulary (cursing every other word) even though the course was not that crowded. Secondly, on more than one hole, the sprinklers were on in the fairway as we were playing through--a worker was even present, but did not turn them off so we could play through them. Other than these things, it was a great round at a great price--would play it again!"
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"The course is in great shape. Good to see a club, that gets a lot of play, be in terrific."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,The staff and marshalls were very unfriendly and treated us like we didn't belong. I will NOT be playing this course again.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,It’s nice playing a course in such good condition.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,My son and I book a tee time on Father's day and when we arrived we paid and got out to start and they told us we had to pair up with 2 people we didn't know. I ask for money back and I was told to bad. The owner is extremely rude. My son and I were stuck paying 110 bucks and didn't get to enjoy ourselves. If they would have said from the beginning we would be paired we would of went somewhere else but they didn't.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"The Legends of Indiana in Franklin, Indiana is always in nice condition. The fairways are reasonably wide, but some are harder to hit. The greens have plenty of undulations and are of average speed."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,First time playing and I’ll be back for sure. Beautiful course and challenging for an intermediate player.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"The legends golf club is a great value and gives off the feel of a true golfers facility with its driving range, putting greens, and 27 hole course. The whole area is nice and open so nothing feels cramped. The course itself is a nice layout and was in pretty good shape for fairly early in the season. I also enjoy coming to legends."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Pros; played middle to roadGreens as always smooth and fastFairways a little spotty but very nice4 hour round not badCons:Lady at desk and starter not on same pageShe said single joining us starter said another 2 someWorked out well Two nice guysBunkers need some work
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Very smooth day, even with a high volume of golfers. Staff was friendly and efficient. Will definitely return!"
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"The course is in very bad condition, very muddy after rain. It was rainning during our play. Tried to ask for a rain check but was declined. Will not play there again."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Course was in great shape. Greens were fast and true. The starter acted like he had better things to do than be bothered by my question about the rotation I was playing.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Drove by this course several times but never made time to stop in. The staff was courteous and attentive. (With COVID 19, make sure to be there early to check in.)The course was well maintained, but that is because the grounds crew was trimming the greens as we were chipping up. The signage needs some attention. For a first timer, it was difficult to get to the starting tee and the follow-on back nine. For the expense, I would call ahead next time and figure out the grounds crew schedule before I booked."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,The greens are in great shape. The course in general is well maintained.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,This is the second time i have played here. The place is well organized and flows real smooth. I say it’s the chic filet of courses because the staff are so nice/ courteous they make you feel like you have been going here for years. Even the ranger is a awesome dude i love this place just wish i lived a little closer.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Most impressive were the greens. Some marks from players failing to repair divots, but it’s obvious the greens crew know how to manicure a green. Smooth, fast rolls, that break true. Impressive for Indiana in September."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Very Good course, great price on deal. Our 4-some enjoyed the course and the challenge. Hope play a few more times before winter."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Booked the wrong course and Golfnow website would not allow me to cancel.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Since we reserved our round for only 3 people, the possibility of a ""perfect stranger"" joining us is always there. I asked the young man in the club house if the course had a provision for providing and extra cart for such a situation. He said that a 4 person round merits 2 carts. A third cart would cost $16. I let him know that just down the road (Timbergate), they had modified their carts with a plexi-glass barrier that extend the length of the interior of the cart, effectively ""dividing"" the cart in half when it came to breathing space. Legends should do the same with some their carts!"
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"It was “ Blistering Hot!” yesterday, so I really appreciated the course having ice water available in the course coolers and clubhouse!"
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,First course I’ve seen doing this yet this year w all the COVID 19 restrictions
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Thanks for your service!
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"I've been going here for a while and the course is always in great shape. Course plays long especially for my game but no complaints. Fairly wide open with exception of some water and sand which i seem to find. Good staff, mostly friendly. My only complaint is paying $16 extra to ride solo thru the week when they weren't busy at all. Doesn't seem fair that people with underlining conditions have to pay extra to golf. Weekends I totally understand. But overall I like this course."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,I really enjoyed playing here. It was my first time to play. We played Creek & Road. The course offers plenty of challenges but isn't unfair. Greens were beautiful. It was in very good shape.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Had a great day of golf. Got a good rate on golf now. 12 dollars cheaper than at the course. Friendly staff. Golf conditions were good. Had been several years since playing at the legends. The course had grown a little and it probably was not in as good of condition as it had been when I played there about 5 years ago, but still nice and worth playing. My only gripe would be the poor sand quality that is in the bunkers. It is sand you see on a Indiana beach or quarry. Not the kind of sand that should be used for a golf course. Enjoyed my day of golf as the weather was great and shot a 76 from the black tees."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Excellent condition. Friendly service. Good food.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Great for under 30.00 course I near nowhere tho. Lol
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Course was in decent shape. Work needs done around the ponds
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Being there for the first time the layout was very confusing. The course was in very good shape.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"They know how to run a golf course. Packed on a Sunday afternoon, but wife and I played in 3-1/2 hrs even with cart path only. Course in great shape. All for $20. Pretty tough to beat."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"The course was in very good shape for the middle of summer. However, the course layout seemed boring and flat for the hype it gets in Indiana. There are other nearby courses that are more fun and cheaper. Also, the starter got mad at us for getting to the tee box 1 minute behind schedule even though no groups were behind us. We caught up to a few groups in front of us within 5 holes and the pace of play was very slow from there."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"The middle and road nines get all of the love at the legends, but the creek 9 is my favorite of the three. The opening hole is a solid dog leg par 5 that can be birdie or double depending on how you play it. The second hole is a formidable par three and arguable the toughest hole on the property with length and a pond that is highly in play. The rest of course offers a great challenge and offers a good variety to the course."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"I am a new member at the legends this year, and I have been very pleased with the course so far. The course has been n good shape for the fall. The greens are in good shape considering how much play the course gets. The middle/road course is more of a links style layout with a good variety of holes. The layout can be scored upon depending on the wind. The bunkers could use some work, but other than that it has been excellent fall golf. The customer service is excellent!"
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Played Sept of 2019. Course was in very good shape. Good course to visit. Wouldn’t play it every week but look forward to playing it when I do.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,we had a fun day of golf at the Legends...the course was in good shape...a few blind shots but pretty good layout...there are a lot of good golf courses in indy...this would be in the middle of the pack
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Staff friendly. Course in very good shape. Layout is fun. Pace very nice. Would play frequently if I lived in Indy.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"It was a beautiful late summer day and I think everyone had the same idea as me. The course was packed from morning till dusk. They did a good job of keeping everyone moving. However, we were backed up on 2-4 holes. Not terrible but a little bit of a delay. The course was in outstanding condition. I started at the range, then the chipping green, and ended up playing all three courses before the day ended. If they can keep people moving, this course is definitely worth a visit."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"I live in the area and have played this course maybe 10 times. I love the course and conditions are always pretty good. The course needs to better maintain three things though. 1. Cut down tall shrubs around the ponds, on some holes when playing from the blue you have no view of the fairway. 2. Need to water the rough, hitting from rough was like hitting from concrete (this is a common problem in most courses this year due to heat). 3. Sand in the bunkers is very grainy can use new sand.I will still go and play again though, fairways and greens are perfect even after this scorching heat and staff is very friendly and accommodating."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,This course is always in good shape !Greens are always smooth and usually fastGood layout with all the trouble you need with errant shotsPlay this course about 25 time a yearNever get tired of it !BG
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Melted in the heat around the Middle/road course at Legends. The course has an interesting layout, with some contours that are links-style, but enough trees on it here and there to not really be a links course. Some water in play as well. Putts never broke as much as I expected. Overall most of the course was in good shape, with some minor spotting here and there in the fairways. Greens and tees were solid. Sand was a little inconsistent and rocky. They care about and enforce pace of play, which more courses should do. Definitely worth a stop if you're driving down 65. I'll be back to check out the other 9 and par 3 course."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"I was very impressed as a first timer at the Legends course. The staff was friendly and professional. The course had numerous challenges including bunkers, water hazards, and long grass, yet there were opportunities to score well on many of the holes. Overall, a great course and value. I would highly recommend to any golf enthusiasts."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"The course was in excellent condition. Greens and tee beds very nice. Rough was challenging, so great incentive to keep shots straight and on target. Bunkers in decent shape, although the sand includes little stones.I like that the course management provides written responsibilities for those using the course, both in maintenance and time management."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,The course was very wet which made for challenging play from the rough. Cart paths were flooded.All that said and the course was still playable!
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Creek for First nine. Needs a little TLC. Bunkers a little rough, and the grass needs some love. But it's early. Road nine in much better shape. Definitely had more care and attention. Good round. Good course. Not what it was, but still a good track."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"This course was in pretty good shape for early season. With all the rain we have had, I wasn't expecting the course to be in good shape but I was pleasantly surprised."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"The course conditions this morning weren't the best, mainly due to the heavy rains. Other than that, it looks like the course will be in great shape once again this year at the Legends. Can't beat it for then money either."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"The Legends was a very nice course. Very well-kept even after some rain. But, no ranger out to monitor pace of play. We got stuck behind a slow foursome and wasn’t able to get in front."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Nice option in the greater Indianapolis area. Played 36 holes with my group from Michigan without having to play the exact same 18. Fun course...we had a nice time here.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"It was my second time playing there, but won’t be the last. Course was in great shape, layout was fun to play, and staff was very nice and helpful."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"My daughter and I played 9 holes on a rainy day. The course was pretty much empty as the weather front scared people off for a couple of days. However, course was in great shape. I play golf about 3-5 times per month and this is one of the better condition courses I’ve okayed on this year. We will definitely be back, just hoping for better weather."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"First, booked middle and road nines. When arrived we were sent to road and creek nines. You should be able to book what you want to play."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Second, every trap was unplayable. The course was wet, but there wasn’t sand in the traps if conditions were drier. Sad to see an old reliable course begin the slide downhill"
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"The Legends is a very nice track. It was my third time playing there this year. Everything was great...however the greens were a little dry. Pretty sure they were under some heat stress. Same goes for the fairway and rough areas. Overall though, it's still a great course (at a great price). Definitely worth the drive."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Legends is a mere shadow of the pristine splendor it was years ago.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"The Legends is one of my favorite courses in Central Indiana...it didn't disappoint this past Sunday. Great pace of play, beautiful course conditions, and a great layout...the only downside is that it was a little wet on the course from the previous evening. Other than that, it was great!"
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Played here the last 3 Sundays, so I wanted to get a review in. Course is in pretty solid shape, tee boxes are good, fairways are firm and greens are firm and fast. Most bunkers are in good shape, though I found a few that hadn't been treated in a while. Rough is dry and can be patchy. I'm good with that - it's not where you should be hitting and if you do, it should be a challenge. Just don't expect the ball to hang up much, so if you're crooked it's gonna bounce."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"If you've haven't played here before, you should really enjoy the day. I like the layout, with a some fairly generous landing areas in the fairway and some elevated greens. I think the course pivots nicely from harder holes to easier ones, keeping pace well. Wind is always a factor out there, so club appropriately. Water isn't predominately a factor unless you're chunking the ball. From the right tees, you can bust a good tee shot to get a good look at birdie, and the Par 5s are gettable too. I really like the start on the Road side, with a par 5, then back to back tough par 4s."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Volume is up thanks to the membership deal (incl. me); I'll be watching to see if they can keep the pace (with volume/conditions and actual pace of play).
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Made tee time 2 days in advance and couldn’t even play the course I paid for because they were too busy so they pushed me over to another 9 holes which wasn’t as nice. Pretty disappointing!
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Greens rolled very well, but the rest of the course was rough."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Always happy to get a round in this late in November. The course was in great condition. Very few people on the course so we played at our own pace which is pretty quick (18 holes in 2.5 hours).
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"a little pricey for the end of October, that is only complaint."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Played creek and road nines. Creek was very slow pace. No groups allowing play through. Bunkers had grape sized rocks in them. Not impressed. Road nine was quick. Dont care for houses that close. Bunkers were better. Not bad for a hot deal but not worth the drive for me.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Course was in perfect condition and greens were in great shape. This course has always been in emmaculate condition. I recommend this course for experienced golfers.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Greens were in excellent condition, pace was good. Some bunkers need work as too muddy conditions others were great."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Great course, excellent value! Course was in perfect condition."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Course was in great shape, well kept. Amazing course for the discount price."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,I love this course- I'm almost always a single and they have never had a problem. Other golfers also understand and let me play thru all the time.(some places I play they won't let me play thru no matter how slow they are)
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Bunkers and upper tee boxes still need work.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Keep up the great work!
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,I purchased a 3:34pm tee time thru GolfNow for 9 holes at $20/person. When I got there I was told that it's $23/person. Shower them my confirmation/receipt and they still refused to honor the $20/9 holes. Ended up paying the extra money and played anyway. Sand traps haven't been raked all season and ended up moving ball out of traps due to poor conditions. Didn't want to break a club or my wrist.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Greens quick and fairways were rolling well. Only drawback were bunkers that had been replenished but not worked.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Every time I play this course. I always end up thinking....Why don't I play here more often?!Just a great course. Greens are flat. It never breaks as much as it looks.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Hadn't played the course in a couple of years. Surprised at how bad a condition it was in.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,I really enjoyed this course. I was a single and got paired with a threesome and we all had a great time. Very nice course the only downside to the course is the green wasn't mowed.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"The course was in decent condition for February weather, Greens were better than expected although bunkers are still out of play due to winter weather. Definitly looking forward to the spring! Should be ready then."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,The course and greens were in great shape except for the usual bit of Fall debris on the greens (pine needles / leaves etc.) The tee markers were not there for some reason but had my GPS and estimated approx. tee position. Overall very happy with the course!
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,The condition of the course (Middle & Road nines) was excellent. Fairways and greens were in peak shape. Certainly no signs or after effects from any aeration or top dressing. Greens held very well and putted exceptionally true.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,This is my 3rd time playing this Course and the Course was in the Best Condition of all them. The Fairways were cut nice and the Greens were Great as well.And at Golf now price it was well worth and and look forward to coming back. Would love to play Creek but thats not offerd on Golf Now.The staff was great as well as the Tenderloin Sandwich.Multiple sets of tees allow every golfer of every skill level to enjoy great time.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,The course was in great condition and the staff was very friendly
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Only played here a few times, mostly because of distance from my home, bit absolutely love this course! Very well maintained with the truest rolling greens! Scenic layout with varying challenges. Number of bunkers is a little intimidating, but fortunately we stayed out of them for most of the round! Wish this course was closer as I would play here more often! Highly recommend to anyone who wants to play a truly nice and challenging course!"
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Pete Dye courses are infamous for their number of bunkers and for that reason they should be in excellent condition. The bunkers appear to have not had new sand added since the course originally opened. Most of them not raked and edges not pulled up on any of them with 98% of them having rutted edges from wash-out. Several had grass growing in them.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Otherwise, it's an above average course. Would play there again if the GN deal was right."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Very fast greens and course is in phenomenal condition! Very challenging for all levels! I didn't care for the bunkers because they had a lot of pebbles and hard compacted sand but fairways and greens are perfect! Beautiful golf course!
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,My son and I had a great time playing here the greens were fast and pure we played from the blues and was a good challenge for the both of us
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,I don't play this course very often but when I do it's always in superb shape and is well worth every penny that is spent on it. I played on May 23rd and the day couldn't have been any more perfect except for a lower score. If you haven't played here you are missing out on a true gem in the Indianapolis area.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Greens are fast and smooth. I play this course quite often. The course is always in good shape except the sand traps which does not matter to me. They are much better now.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Good course - played 18 in 4 hours - only issue was there were no ball washers on the course and had been alot of rain - no way to clean muddy ball.staff was friendly
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Love the course the only problem I have the bunkers need work
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Course was in great shape even thoughbthe climate has been very dry the last month.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"We grabbed a Hot Deal, and played Sunday October 11. Course was in outstanding condition. Greens are fast and true. Fairways are lush and green. Tee boxes were well kept. I've played here many times in the past. It is a similar course to Heartland Crossing, but the Legends must have more cash behind the operation because they are doing a much better job of keeping up their property."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Great course for Fall play. Fewer trees means less time trudging through the leaves.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,We had a very enjoyable time. The course was in excellent condition. I'll be back reasonably soon.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Course in great shape for all the rain we have had
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"This was the third tone I've been on this course, with all the train we've had the course was still in great shape, the creek on 15 was a large pond and I really liked it, they should make it permanent"
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Understanding that it has been wet but that is no reason to stop all course up keeping. Great design, just seems the course is being let go."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Great course but it was a little bit saturated due to all the rain
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"The Legends is well known around town. Everything was great except one thing. The greens were rough. The ball would bounce most of the way to the hole on more than a few holes. Other than that, was a good time. Would have been even better if it wasn't for my terrible score!"
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"This course offers a number of different options. There is the 27 hole course, as well as, a 18 hole par 3 course. Course was in good condition. The grounds crew was out doing some much needed work on the bunkers. Would recommend."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,had a great time...played well and the people I played with played well. Staff was very accommodating for a single player.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"I come here a lot and a girl who was just started working snack bar was taking care of me she was awesome she had went to the back to go grab some banana peppers for my sandwich and Cindy Bishop comes slamming the side door open saying, "" Sorry______ is new she doesn't know what she is doing yet."" I proceeded to say she is taking care of me just fine and her sister works here and She knows her way around. And Cindy then said, "" well I'm sorry for the slow pace"" The young lady taking care of me was excellent she is a server and knows her way with food and drinks. I have never been so embarrassed for a manager until that day. Cindy needs to learn to treat her employees a lot better and more people might come in and get food and drinks if she knew how to treat people."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"I moved here from FL so I'm a bit spoiled by great golf and service. This is a good track, nice layout. Minimal interaction with the staff but it was just okay, not great."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,I really like the layout of a few different holes on the course my only complaint is that the fairways and greens were in bad shape. I expected them to be in tip top shape for the 40 a person. I have played city courses that are in better shape then this one is at the moment. Staff was amazing. Also they had a demo out on the range that was supposed to last until 3pm but they packed up at 230 and left. Right as we were coming off of hole 18.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Nice course. Conditions were great. Forgiving course.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,this is a nice course!! the facilities are nice and the greens and tee boxes are really nice!! the only thing I thought would be nicer are the fairways but I still highly recommend it!!
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Played this morning, was a nice day & course was in great shape. We had a lot of rain yesterday, but this course drains pretty well. Tees, fairways and rough were all maintained nicely. Greens were in great shape and fast. Bunkers are being worked on (according to signage on clubhouse) and they were a little blown out by water. I only found 2 of them today and took advantage of the rake/re-drop rule in effect. This course is almost always in good shape, today no exception. I'd have expected them to ask for a little more competitive green fee (we pd. 45) for Oct mid-week, but we got a good course."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"The Legends is a nice course, home of the Indiana chapter of the PGA. Expect some challenges, not many trees but plenty of water and sand. 27 holes to choose from as well, so always an adventure!"
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Played at 4pm and everything was great!There was a slow twosome in front of us, but it was a beautiful day and beautiful course :)"
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"I played this course in early June and loved it. Soft tee boxes, well-kept fairways and fast, smooth greens. Unfortunately it seemed as if the maintenance staff had merely quit trying towards the end of the summer. It was still in ""good"" shape but not nearly as nice as earlier in the year. The most noticable difference were the greens. Speed and smoothness of the greens had significantly decreased. Still a good value at $20 to ride 18, but didn't leave wanting to come back soon."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Very challenging course for the average player.very nice practice facility .prices in the club house were very reasonable and the staff was very polite
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"course in great shape, Bunkers need attention, not much sand more like dirt."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Apparently golfers at these courses don't know how to fix ball marks. Maybe the softness of the greens contributed to multiple unrepaired divots on greens. The greens were fairly fast and true but unrepaired divots impacted several putts. The fairways were mowed at higher level than you normally experience on courses charging $55 a round. Sand traps were littered with rocks due to deteriorating condition of upper bunker walls. Glad I didn't pay full price to play this course.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Course was in great shape a lot of sand traps beware
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"very nice course that is in great shape,was a great deal"
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,This is a great daily fee golf course. Three nines so pace of play is outstanding. Well designed with good greens. Always an enjoyable game.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,This was the first time I played this course. Course was in good condition and I would definitely play here again.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Course very well maintained and in excellent condition. Rough not to high. Greens in excellent shape. Staff was friendly. I played as a single with no problems. 2 4-somes let me play thru as well... which was nice for a change.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,since I am used to playing golf ind western Pennsylvania this course was a nice reprieve. my brother and I play there on Monday afternoon and there were hardly anyone on the course. the course was well maintained and had a nice variety of difficulty. sand traps were a little hard but that is nothing out of the ordinary. the greens were freshly top dressed and still a little quick I can't imagine how they are in normal play. my only complaint is that they recently put in 15 inch holes to accommodate soccer players to play foot golf. this would not have bothered me but I had an eagle attempt on a par 5 and the 15 inch hole was right and my way. well well worth the 20 on golfNow definitely get a round in there
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,Has it all for the beginners to the scratch golfer.
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Course was heavily watered, no roll on fairways. Understandable for these weather conditions. Greens rolled true and were in good condition. Good experience."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,We booked Middle to Road but when we arrived we were put onto the Middle to Creek. Then while making the turn a two some was put in front of us slowing the back nine down by over 30 minutes. Not the best!
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Moreover, I can play without crowded because 27 holes."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,This course is not the longest you will play but these Par 4's that are less then 400 yards are very challenging! GIR's are very important because scrambling is tougher at this course then most! This is a direct affect of the course being a Pete Dye design. And throw in the wind and you have all the challenge you will need. This is a great course regardless how long off the tee the player is! I will be back again for sure...
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"I got a great deal at a great course, thanks golfnow!"
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"The course was in great shape and challenging as always. Unfortunately the rate I booked was for a senior rate, so we had to pay more to play. Nevertheless, I would recommend this course for sure."
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"Despite weather changes, Legends remains the best condition course I have played in Indiana during the month of October. Greens were firm but a well placed approach shot was easy to keep on. Only real complaint was that a few bunkers were rock hard and very difficult to control. Overall, highly recommended"
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,recommend staff very friendly had good time would play again
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,It had been at least 10yrs since I had played here and I expected it to look as good as it did because it was The Legends!! It was raining half of our round and it was stillGREAT!!!
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,"greens always in great shape and very consistent,bunkers could use some sand and attention,for cost GPS would be nice on carts,great practice range"
The Legends Golf Club - Middle/Road Course,536-the-legends-golf-club-middle-road-course,I thought this was a very nice course/layout away from the city. It is a bit of a drive from Indianapolis but well worth the drive at least once. The course was in great condition from tee to green and the staff was super friendly in accommodating us. Get a group of buddies together and have a good time playing a very nice course. I give it a 4 stars and not a 5 because the fairways are bluegrass instead of bent grass (personal preference and not meant to be a knock on the course). If you like bluegrass you will likely love this place and give it a 5.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Great conditions and weather! But watch out for the mean lady on hole 6, according to her she will shoot somebody."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,played the two oldest 9 holes. had not played course in a couple of years. thought greens rolled very well as well as fairways. no complaints.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,This course is always very well maintained. It’s a fun course for all level of golfers. Place of play has not been an issue. I’ll definitely be back.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,We played in three hours and 45 minutes. The greens were in excellent condition even though there had been rain recently. This course always plays well and holds up very well when many other courses are cartpath only or closed.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Course is in good shape. Pace was slow on first 9 and then fast on the second. We didn’t feel welcome on the course though. None of the people we encountered made us feel like they wanted us there. Plenty of other options so I doubt we are back anytime soon.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"The fairways were in great shape. The greens were in great shape, the rough would penalize you"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Great winter golf at the Legends. Ron the starter was very accommodating.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Fairways was in great shape, green are in great shape, the rough would make you pay a price"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Numerous challenges, but not terribly difficult. Course was in great condition as always. You will enjoy your round IF you play the right tees."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,we played The Legends on a windy Nov. day. there are a lot of new houses(with new OB). Course in very good condition. Everyone was great to us.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"I'll never play The Legends Golf Club again. The starter was very rude to me and my guest, his treatment of customers is not acceptable. I run a small business and if any of my employees ever spoke to a customer, the way we were treated by the starter, I'd fire them on the spot. I've played too many public courses and some fantastic private courses around Indy to ever have to put up with a rude starter, and I just won't accept rude treatment when I'm the customer. This starter didn't ask us to move our cart, he could have easily said excuse me sir, do you mind moving or even said ""please"", but NO, he skipped polite asking nicely or even asking at all and went straight to giving orders/ commands, demands telling us to move our cart and when I looked at him in disbelief as he came flying up to us, he then goes onto say: ""I'll have your privileges taken away."" The only thing I said to him the entire time he was barking orders at us was that I don't want to ever play here again. I told him our tee time and we left. I paid for 2 rounds on golfnow but that's fine at least golfnow gets something, I like to support good companies. So, I went home and picked up my son and we went to a different course to hit balls, chip, and putt and enjoy the beautiful day. I was happy I even had time to mow the grass so the day wasn't wasted. So many great choices for golf around central Indiana to ever waste your time and money going to The Legends Golf Club. I've got a few buddies with similar experiences here also with a mean / nasty range/ starter, maybe it's time they look into this and hire some new folks that treat Customers with a smidge of respect. I'll be 100% sure to tell everyone I play with in the two golf leagues I play in and the other league I sub in, as well as, my weekend group I play with about my experience at The Legends Golf Club, I think I have a complete email list also to all the members at Old Oakland Golf Club too from when I was a member there, but I doubt they'd care about a public course like The Legends, but I'll let them know too just in case. Play anywhere besides The Legends Golf Club is my best advice for every and All Golfers!"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Nice balance of challenging holes and gettable holes! Water, elevation and bunkers are well placed and demand consideration"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"27 holes of golf, all well cared for. Practice facilities are top notch. Not very difficult but scores have to be earned. I enjoyed playing here for third time this year."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Always enjoy playing the Legends.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,The course is always in great shape and a pleasure to play.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Don't come to this place unless you are super good at golfing. We played in a reasonable pace as amateurs, but we were rushed on every holes by the ranger. When we finished 9 holes, the ranger told us that we have to finish the 9 holes in two hours, otherwise, he is going to remove us from the course. We felt this is rude. We paid to play the course as friends together, just for a relaxed game and having some fun. This course is definitely not for that. Stay away from it."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,You can always count on this course being in good shape.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"I live an hour north of Legends, but I was happy that I made the drive. Great Pete Dye layout, friendly staff, and friendly people on the course. It is still early in the year and the grasses are not active and growing, but the course is in great shape and the greens are very nice considering the time of the year. I’ll be back."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,it’s still technically winter here. Had a good time and would play again here but summer prices are a little crazy. The staff was very nice and helpful.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,The 27 hole regulation course has some wonderful undulating greens. The middle and road 9 have housing on several holes. The creek 9 has no housing and some rolling terrain.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,The Dye Course has abandoned the back 9 on its par 3 course.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Creek to MiddleStarter starts us start on creek, we tee off as a twosomeGo to our balls and starter comes out tells us to go backto tee, we need to start over????? We drive back then he tells usto join another twosome, who are in separate carts, what a way to start the round. What a cluster F—-kWon’t be back. Not worth the drive."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Loved the choice of tees. Love the lack of blind shots. It is all in front of you.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"27 holes available, reasonably priced, and terrific greens. Sign me up. It was a bit windy (like it normally is out here in the converted corn field), so scores suffered, but what a great track given the location. Not a bunch of up and down terrain, but most greens are elevated, there is a water hazard (penalty area now I guess) that comes into play on almost every hole. No duplication or similar holes at all. My favorite, although it isn’t the original 18, is the Creek 9. Normally in better shape, has the hardest par 3, par 4 and par 5 back-to-back-to-back on the whole 27 (IMO). Numbers 2, 3, and 4 will eat your lunch if the wind is blowing from the North! So much fun here, and the people are great."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,I will play here again. And again.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Great time, course was in great shape. Pace of play was a little slow, but not bad, about 4 1/2 hours. Tee boxes could be in better shape, green were fair to good. Fairways and rough were well maintained. Overall, great round for the money."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Ranger told us on 3 occasion to pickup the pace. When the group in front us wasn't clear for us to hit. The Rangers needs to identify were the problem is before ask a group to pickup pace. This was a extremely disappointing day of golf.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Paired up as a single force to ride with a strangeror pay additional $16 for separate cart. Round took 4:45 and didn’t see first ranger. Not going back.Greens need a lot of work .
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,It was raining when we got there. But the entire staff was very friendly. The course was beautiful. And it quit raining about the ninth hole. The sun came out and it was a great day
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Had some unseasonal warm weather on new years eve so we decided to enjoy a final round of golf in 2021. The course was very wet in areas but considering the weather in previous days it was actually in great shape. The greens were perfect and the tee boxes were good as well. Pace was fast and we had no issues at all. If you want a fun course with plenty of differing holes you should try the Legends!
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,The course was in great shape for December. I lost my driver cover and my phone and they had them the next day.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Shaggy gon sneeze. Get em wet shaggy. Bet you want to make a big ol sandwich.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"The course was in good to great condition, especially considering the recent lack of rain. The fairways and greens were in good condition. The tees were a little hard, but not bad. There was a foursome a couple of groups in front of use that was really slow. So we did some waiting on a lot of the holes. It was really hot, and it would have been nice if there was complimentary tap water with ice in insulated cups available. They did have complimentary water with ice in the club house. But the cups were small, and not insulated (paper). My ice lasted about two holes."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"We enjoyed the round; course is challenging and well-taken care of. Only complaints is that they put us with two other golfers with a very limited vocabulary (cursing every other word) even though the course was not that crowded. Secondly, on more than one hole, the sprinklers were on in the fairway as we were playing through--a worker was even present, but did not turn them off so we could play through them. Other than these things, it was a great round at a great price--would play it again!"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"The course is in great shape. Good to see a club, that gets a lot of play, be in terrific."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,The staff and marshalls were very unfriendly and treated us like we didn't belong. I will NOT be playing this course again.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,It’s nice playing a course in such good condition.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,My son and I book a tee time on Father's day and when we arrived we paid and got out to start and they told us we had to pair up with 2 people we didn't know. I ask for money back and I was told to bad. The owner is extremely rude. My son and I were stuck paying 110 bucks and didn't get to enjoy ourselves. If they would have said from the beginning we would be paired we would of went somewhere else but they didn't.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"The Legends of Indiana in Franklin, Indiana is always in nice condition. The fairways are reasonably wide, but some are harder to hit. The greens have plenty of undulations and are of average speed."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,First time playing and I’ll be back for sure. Beautiful course and challenging for an intermediate player.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"The legends golf club is a great value and gives off the feel of a true golfers facility with its driving range, putting greens, and 27 hole course. The whole area is nice and open so nothing feels cramped. The course itself is a nice layout and was in pretty good shape for fairly early in the season. I also enjoy coming to legends."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Pros; played middle to roadGreens as always smooth and fastFairways a little spotty but very nice4 hour round not badCons:Lady at desk and starter not on same pageShe said single joining us starter said another 2 someWorked out well Two nice guysBunkers need some work
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Very smooth day, even with a high volume of golfers. Staff was friendly and efficient. Will definitely return!"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"The course is in very bad condition, very muddy after rain. It was rainning during our play. Tried to ask for a rain check but was declined. Will not play there again."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Course was in great shape. Greens were fast and true. The starter acted like he had better things to do than be bothered by my question about the rotation I was playing.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Drove by this course several times but never made time to stop in. The staff was courteous and attentive. (With COVID 19, make sure to be there early to check in.)The course was well maintained, but that is because the grounds crew was trimming the greens as we were chipping up. The signage needs some attention. For a first timer, it was difficult to get to the starting tee and the follow-on back nine. For the expense, I would call ahead next time and figure out the grounds crew schedule before I booked."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,The greens are in great shape. The course in general is well maintained.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,This is the second time i have played here. The place is well organized and flows real smooth. I say it’s the chic filet of courses because the staff are so nice/ courteous they make you feel like you have been going here for years. Even the ranger is a awesome dude i love this place just wish i lived a little closer.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Most impressive were the greens. Some marks from players failing to repair divots, but it’s obvious the greens crew know how to manicure a green. Smooth, fast rolls, that break true. Impressive for Indiana in September."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Very Good course, great price on deal. Our 4-some enjoyed the course and the challenge. Hope play a few more times before winter."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Booked the wrong course and Golfnow website would not allow me to cancel.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Since we reserved our round for only 3 people, the possibility of a ""perfect stranger"" joining us is always there. I asked the young man in the club house if the course had a provision for providing and extra cart for such a situation. He said that a 4 person round merits 2 carts. A third cart would cost $16. I let him know that just down the road (Timbergate), they had modified their carts with a plexi-glass barrier that extend the length of the interior of the cart, effectively ""dividing"" the cart in half when it came to breathing space. Legends should do the same with some their carts!"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"It was “ Blistering Hot!” yesterday, so I really appreciated the course having ice water available in the course coolers and clubhouse!"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,First course I’ve seen doing this yet this year w all the COVID 19 restrictions
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Thanks for your service!
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"I've been going here for a while and the course is always in great shape. Course plays long especially for my game but no complaints. Fairly wide open with exception of some water and sand which i seem to find. Good staff, mostly friendly. My only complaint is paying $16 extra to ride solo thru the week when they weren't busy at all. Doesn't seem fair that people with underlining conditions have to pay extra to golf. Weekends I totally understand. But overall I like this course."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,I really enjoyed playing here. It was my first time to play. We played Creek & Road. The course offers plenty of challenges but isn't unfair. Greens were beautiful. It was in very good shape.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Had a great day of golf. Got a good rate on golf now. 12 dollars cheaper than at the course. Friendly staff. Golf conditions were good. Had been several years since playing at the legends. The course had grown a little and it probably was not in as good of condition as it had been when I played there about 5 years ago, but still nice and worth playing. My only gripe would be the poor sand quality that is in the bunkers. It is sand you see on a Indiana beach or quarry. Not the kind of sand that should be used for a golf course. Enjoyed my day of golf as the weather was great and shot a 76 from the black tees."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Excellent condition. Friendly service. Good food.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Great for under 30.00 course I near nowhere tho. Lol
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Course was in decent shape. Work needs done around the ponds
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Being there for the first time the layout was very confusing. The course was in very good shape.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"They know how to run a golf course. Packed on a Sunday afternoon, but wife and I played in 3-1/2 hrs even with cart path only. Course in great shape. All for $20. Pretty tough to beat."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"The course was in very good shape for the middle of summer. However, the course layout seemed boring and flat for the hype it gets in Indiana. There are other nearby courses that are more fun and cheaper. Also, the starter got mad at us for getting to the tee box 1 minute behind schedule even though no groups were behind us. We caught up to a few groups in front of us within 5 holes and the pace of play was very slow from there."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"The middle and road nines get all of the love at the legends, but the creek 9 is my favorite of the three. The opening hole is a solid dog leg par 5 that can be birdie or double depending on how you play it. The second hole is a formidable par three and arguable the toughest hole on the property with length and a pond that is highly in play. The rest of course offers a great challenge and offers a good variety to the course."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"I am a new member at the legends this year, and I have been very pleased with the course so far. The course has been n good shape for the fall. The greens are in good shape considering how much play the course gets. The middle/road course is more of a links style layout with a good variety of holes. The layout can be scored upon depending on the wind. The bunkers could use some work, but other than that it has been excellent fall golf. The customer service is excellent!"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Played Sept of 2019. Course was in very good shape. Good course to visit. Wouldn’t play it every week but look forward to playing it when I do.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,we had a fun day of golf at the Legends...the course was in good shape...a few blind shots but pretty good layout...there are a lot of good golf courses in indy...this would be in the middle of the pack
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Staff friendly. Course in very good shape. Layout is fun. Pace very nice. Would play frequently if I lived in Indy.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"It was a beautiful late summer day and I think everyone had the same idea as me. The course was packed from morning till dusk. They did a good job of keeping everyone moving. However, we were backed up on 2-4 holes. Not terrible but a little bit of a delay. The course was in outstanding condition. I started at the range, then the chipping green, and ended up playing all three courses before the day ended. If they can keep people moving, this course is definitely worth a visit."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"I live in the area and have played this course maybe 10 times. I love the course and conditions are always pretty good. The course needs to better maintain three things though. 1. Cut down tall shrubs around the ponds, on some holes when playing from the blue you have no view of the fairway. 2. Need to water the rough, hitting from rough was like hitting from concrete (this is a common problem in most courses this year due to heat). 3. Sand in the bunkers is very grainy can use new sand.I will still go and play again though, fairways and greens are perfect even after this scorching heat and staff is very friendly and accommodating."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,This course is always in good shape !Greens are always smooth and usually fastGood layout with all the trouble you need with errant shotsPlay this course about 25 time a yearNever get tired of it !BG
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Melted in the heat around the Middle/road course at Legends. The course has an interesting layout, with some contours that are links-style, but enough trees on it here and there to not really be a links course. Some water in play as well. Putts never broke as much as I expected. Overall most of the course was in good shape, with some minor spotting here and there in the fairways. Greens and tees were solid. Sand was a little inconsistent and rocky. They care about and enforce pace of play, which more courses should do. Definitely worth a stop if you're driving down 65. I'll be back to check out the other 9 and par 3 course."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"I was very impressed as a first timer at the Legends course. The staff was friendly and professional. The course had numerous challenges including bunkers, water hazards, and long grass, yet there were opportunities to score well on many of the holes. Overall, a great course and value. I would highly recommend to any golf enthusiasts."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"The course was in excellent condition. Greens and tee beds very nice. Rough was challenging, so great incentive to keep shots straight and on target. Bunkers in decent shape, although the sand includes little stones.I like that the course management provides written responsibilities for those using the course, both in maintenance and time management."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,The course was very wet which made for challenging play from the rough. Cart paths were flooded.All that said and the course was still playable!
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Creek for First nine. Needs a little TLC. Bunkers a little rough, and the grass needs some love. But it's early. Road nine in much better shape. Definitely had more care and attention. Good round. Good course. Not what it was, but still a good track."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"This course was in pretty good shape for early season. With all the rain we have had, I wasn't expecting the course to be in good shape but I was pleasantly surprised."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"The course conditions this morning weren't the best, mainly due to the heavy rains. Other than that, it looks like the course will be in great shape once again this year at the Legends. Can't beat it for then money either."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"The Legends was a very nice course. Very well-kept even after some rain. But, no ranger out to monitor pace of play. We got stuck behind a slow foursome and wasn’t able to get in front."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Nice option in the greater Indianapolis area. Played 36 holes with my group from Michigan without having to play the exact same 18. Fun course...we had a nice time here.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"It was my second time playing there, but won’t be the last. Course was in great shape, layout was fun to play, and staff was very nice and helpful."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"My daughter and I played 9 holes on a rainy day. The course was pretty much empty as the weather front scared people off for a couple of days. However, course was in great shape. I play golf about 3-5 times per month and this is one of the better condition courses I’ve okayed on this year. We will definitely be back, just hoping for better weather."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"First, booked middle and road nines. When arrived we were sent to road and creek nines. You should be able to book what you want to play."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Second, every trap was unplayable. The course was wet, but there wasn’t sand in the traps if conditions were drier. Sad to see an old reliable course begin the slide downhill"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"The Legends is a very nice track. It was my third time playing there this year. Everything was great...however the greens were a little dry. Pretty sure they were under some heat stress. Same goes for the fairway and rough areas. Overall though, it's still a great course (at a great price). Definitely worth the drive."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Legends is a mere shadow of the pristine splendor it was years ago.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"The Legends is one of my favorite courses in Central Indiana...it didn't disappoint this past Sunday. Great pace of play, beautiful course conditions, and a great layout...the only downside is that it was a little wet on the course from the previous evening. Other than that, it was great!"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Played here the last 3 Sundays, so I wanted to get a review in. Course is in pretty solid shape, tee boxes are good, fairways are firm and greens are firm and fast. Most bunkers are in good shape, though I found a few that hadn't been treated in a while. Rough is dry and can be patchy. I'm good with that - it's not where you should be hitting and if you do, it should be a challenge. Just don't expect the ball to hang up much, so if you're crooked it's gonna bounce."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"If you've haven't played here before, you should really enjoy the day. I like the layout, with a some fairly generous landing areas in the fairway and some elevated greens. I think the course pivots nicely from harder holes to easier ones, keeping pace well. Wind is always a factor out there, so club appropriately. Water isn't predominately a factor unless you're chunking the ball. From the right tees, you can bust a good tee shot to get a good look at birdie, and the Par 5s are gettable too. I really like the start on the Road side, with a par 5, then back to back tough par 4s."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Volume is up thanks to the membership deal (incl. me); I'll be watching to see if they can keep the pace (with volume/conditions and actual pace of play).
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Made tee time 2 days in advance and couldn’t even play the course I paid for because they were too busy so they pushed me over to another 9 holes which wasn’t as nice. Pretty disappointing!
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Greens rolled very well, but the rest of the course was rough."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Always happy to get a round in this late in November. The course was in great condition. Very few people on the course so we played at our own pace which is pretty quick (18 holes in 2.5 hours).
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"a little pricey for the end of October, that is only complaint."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Played creek and road nines. Creek was very slow pace. No groups allowing play through. Bunkers had grape sized rocks in them. Not impressed. Road nine was quick. Dont care for houses that close. Bunkers were better. Not bad for a hot deal but not worth the drive for me.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Course was in perfect condition and greens were in great shape. This course has always been in emmaculate condition. I recommend this course for experienced golfers.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Greens were in excellent condition, pace was good. Some bunkers need work as too muddy conditions others were great."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Great course, excellent value! Course was in perfect condition."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Course was in great shape, well kept. Amazing course for the discount price."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,I love this course- I'm almost always a single and they have never had a problem. Other golfers also understand and let me play thru all the time.(some places I play they won't let me play thru no matter how slow they are)
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Bunkers and upper tee boxes still need work.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Keep up the great work!
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,I purchased a 3:34pm tee time thru GolfNow for 9 holes at $20/person. When I got there I was told that it's $23/person. Shower them my confirmation/receipt and they still refused to honor the $20/9 holes. Ended up paying the extra money and played anyway. Sand traps haven't been raked all season and ended up moving ball out of traps due to poor conditions. Didn't want to break a club or my wrist.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Greens quick and fairways were rolling well. Only drawback were bunkers that had been replenished but not worked.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Every time I play this course. I always end up thinking....Why don't I play here more often?!Just a great course. Greens are flat. It never breaks as much as it looks.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Hadn't played the course in a couple of years. Surprised at how bad a condition it was in.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,I really enjoyed this course. I was a single and got paired with a threesome and we all had a great time. Very nice course the only downside to the course is the green wasn't mowed.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"The course was in decent condition for February weather, Greens were better than expected although bunkers are still out of play due to winter weather. Definitly looking forward to the spring! Should be ready then."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,The course and greens were in great shape except for the usual bit of Fall debris on the greens (pine needles / leaves etc.) The tee markers were not there for some reason but had my GPS and estimated approx. tee position. Overall very happy with the course!
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,The condition of the course (Middle & Road nines) was excellent. Fairways and greens were in peak shape. Certainly no signs or after effects from any aeration or top dressing. Greens held very well and putted exceptionally true.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,This is my 3rd time playing this Course and the Course was in the Best Condition of all them. The Fairways were cut nice and the Greens were Great as well.And at Golf now price it was well worth and and look forward to coming back. Would love to play Creek but thats not offerd on Golf Now.The staff was great as well as the Tenderloin Sandwich.Multiple sets of tees allow every golfer of every skill level to enjoy great time.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,The course was in great condition and the staff was very friendly
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Only played here a few times, mostly because of distance from my home, bit absolutely love this course! Very well maintained with the truest rolling greens! Scenic layout with varying challenges. Number of bunkers is a little intimidating, but fortunately we stayed out of them for most of the round! Wish this course was closer as I would play here more often! Highly recommend to anyone who wants to play a truly nice and challenging course!"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Pete Dye courses are infamous for their number of bunkers and for that reason they should be in excellent condition. The bunkers appear to have not had new sand added since the course originally opened. Most of them not raked and edges not pulled up on any of them with 98% of them having rutted edges from wash-out. Several had grass growing in them.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Otherwise, it's an above average course. Would play there again if the GN deal was right."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Very fast greens and course is in phenomenal condition! Very challenging for all levels! I didn't care for the bunkers because they had a lot of pebbles and hard compacted sand but fairways and greens are perfect! Beautiful golf course!
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,My son and I had a great time playing here the greens were fast and pure we played from the blues and was a good challenge for the both of us
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,I don't play this course very often but when I do it's always in superb shape and is well worth every penny that is spent on it. I played on May 23rd and the day couldn't have been any more perfect except for a lower score. If you haven't played here you are missing out on a true gem in the Indianapolis area.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Greens are fast and smooth. I play this course quite often. The course is always in good shape except the sand traps which does not matter to me. They are much better now.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Good course - played 18 in 4 hours - only issue was there were no ball washers on the course and had been alot of rain - no way to clean muddy ball.staff was friendly
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Love the course the only problem I have the bunkers need work
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Course was in great shape even thoughbthe climate has been very dry the last month.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"We grabbed a Hot Deal, and played Sunday October 11. Course was in outstanding condition. Greens are fast and true. Fairways are lush and green. Tee boxes were well kept. I've played here many times in the past. It is a similar course to Heartland Crossing, but the Legends must have more cash behind the operation because they are doing a much better job of keeping up their property."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Great course for Fall play. Fewer trees means less time trudging through the leaves.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,We had a very enjoyable time. The course was in excellent condition. I'll be back reasonably soon.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Course in great shape for all the rain we have had
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"This was the third tone I've been on this course, with all the train we've had the course was still in great shape, the creek on 15 was a large pond and I really liked it, they should make it permanent"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Understanding that it has been wet but that is no reason to stop all course up keeping. Great design, just seems the course is being let go."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Great course but it was a little bit saturated due to all the rain
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"The Legends is well known around town. Everything was great except one thing. The greens were rough. The ball would bounce most of the way to the hole on more than a few holes. Other than that, was a good time. Would have been even better if it wasn't for my terrible score!"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"This course offers a number of different options. There is the 27 hole course, as well as, a 18 hole par 3 course. Course was in good condition. The grounds crew was out doing some much needed work on the bunkers. Would recommend."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,had a great time...played well and the people I played with played well. Staff was very accommodating for a single player.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"I come here a lot and a girl who was just started working snack bar was taking care of me she was awesome she had went to the back to go grab some banana peppers for my sandwich and Cindy Bishop comes slamming the side door open saying, "" Sorry______ is new she doesn't know what she is doing yet."" I proceeded to say she is taking care of me just fine and her sister works here and She knows her way around. And Cindy then said, "" well I'm sorry for the slow pace"" The young lady taking care of me was excellent she is a server and knows her way with food and drinks. I have never been so embarrassed for a manager until that day. Cindy needs to learn to treat her employees a lot better and more people might come in and get food and drinks if she knew how to treat people."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"I moved here from FL so I'm a bit spoiled by great golf and service. This is a good track, nice layout. Minimal interaction with the staff but it was just okay, not great."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,I really like the layout of a few different holes on the course my only complaint is that the fairways and greens were in bad shape. I expected them to be in tip top shape for the 40 a person. I have played city courses that are in better shape then this one is at the moment. Staff was amazing. Also they had a demo out on the range that was supposed to last until 3pm but they packed up at 230 and left. Right as we were coming off of hole 18.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Nice course. Conditions were great. Forgiving course.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,this is a nice course!! the facilities are nice and the greens and tee boxes are really nice!! the only thing I thought would be nicer are the fairways but I still highly recommend it!!
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Played this morning, was a nice day & course was in great shape. We had a lot of rain yesterday, but this course drains pretty well. Tees, fairways and rough were all maintained nicely. Greens were in great shape and fast. Bunkers are being worked on (according to signage on clubhouse) and they were a little blown out by water. I only found 2 of them today and took advantage of the rake/re-drop rule in effect. This course is almost always in good shape, today no exception. I'd have expected them to ask for a little more competitive green fee (we pd. 45) for Oct mid-week, but we got a good course."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"The Legends is a nice course, home of the Indiana chapter of the PGA. Expect some challenges, not many trees but plenty of water and sand. 27 holes to choose from as well, so always an adventure!"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Played at 4pm and everything was great!There was a slow twosome in front of us, but it was a beautiful day and beautiful course :)"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"I played this course in early June and loved it. Soft tee boxes, well-kept fairways and fast, smooth greens. Unfortunately it seemed as if the maintenance staff had merely quit trying towards the end of the summer. It was still in ""good"" shape but not nearly as nice as earlier in the year. The most noticable difference were the greens. Speed and smoothness of the greens had significantly decreased. Still a good value at $20 to ride 18, but didn't leave wanting to come back soon."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Very challenging course for the average player.very nice practice facility .prices in the club house were very reasonable and the staff was very polite
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"course in great shape, Bunkers need attention, not much sand more like dirt."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Apparently golfers at these courses don't know how to fix ball marks. Maybe the softness of the greens contributed to multiple unrepaired divots on greens. The greens were fairly fast and true but unrepaired divots impacted several putts. The fairways were mowed at higher level than you normally experience on courses charging $55 a round. Sand traps were littered with rocks due to deteriorating condition of upper bunker walls. Glad I didn't pay full price to play this course.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Course was in great shape a lot of sand traps beware
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"very nice course that is in great shape,was a great deal"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,This is a great daily fee golf course. Three nines so pace of play is outstanding. Well designed with good greens. Always an enjoyable game.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,This was the first time I played this course. Course was in good condition and I would definitely play here again.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Course very well maintained and in excellent condition. Rough not to high. Greens in excellent shape. Staff was friendly. I played as a single with no problems. 2 4-somes let me play thru as well... which was nice for a change.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,since I am used to playing golf ind western Pennsylvania this course was a nice reprieve. my brother and I play there on Monday afternoon and there were hardly anyone on the course. the course was well maintained and had a nice variety of difficulty. sand traps were a little hard but that is nothing out of the ordinary. the greens were freshly top dressed and still a little quick I can't imagine how they are in normal play. my only complaint is that they recently put in 15 inch holes to accommodate soccer players to play foot golf. this would not have bothered me but I had an eagle attempt on a par 5 and the 15 inch hole was right and my way. well well worth the 20 on golfNow definitely get a round in there
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,Has it all for the beginners to the scratch golfer.
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Course was heavily watered, no roll on fairways. Understandable for these weather conditions. Greens rolled true and were in good condition. Good experience."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,We booked Middle to Road but when we arrived we were put onto the Middle to Creek. Then while making the turn a two some was put in front of us slowing the back nine down by over 30 minutes. Not the best!
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Moreover, I can play without crowded because 27 holes."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,This course is not the longest you will play but these Par 4's that are less then 400 yards are very challenging! GIR's are very important because scrambling is tougher at this course then most! This is a direct affect of the course being a Pete Dye design. And throw in the wind and you have all the challenge you will need. This is a great course regardless how long off the tee the player is! I will be back again for sure...
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"I got a great deal at a great course, thanks golfnow!"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"The course was in great shape and challenging as always. Unfortunately the rate I booked was for a senior rate, so we had to pay more to play. Nevertheless, I would recommend this course for sure."
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"Despite weather changes, Legends remains the best condition course I have played in Indiana during the month of October. Greens were firm but a well placed approach shot was easy to keep on. Only real complaint was that a few bunkers were rock hard and very difficult to control. Overall, highly recommended"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,recommend staff very friendly had good time would play again
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,It had been at least 10yrs since I had played here and I expected it to look as good as it did because it was The Legends!! It was raining half of our round and it was stillGREAT!!!
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,"greens always in great shape and very consistent,bunkers could use some sand and attention,for cost GPS would be nice on carts,great practice range"
The Legends Golf Club - Creek/Road Course,535-the-legends-golf-club-creek-road-course,I thought this was a very nice course/layout away from the city. It is a bit of a drive from Indianapolis but well worth the drive at least once. The course was in great condition from tee to green and the staff was super friendly in accommodating us. Get a group of buddies together and have a good time playing a very nice course. I give it a 4 stars and not a 5 because the fairways are bluegrass instead of bent grass (personal preference and not meant to be a knock on the course). If you like bluegrass you will likely love this place and give it a 5.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Front 9 conditions were pretty rough with bare spots in the rough. Cart paths were very rough and bumpy. Back 9 greens were much better. Good staff and restaurant. Appreciate the Senior rates.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Putting green was rough, the rest of course was good."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"4 groups stacked on hole 8 due to a slow group that didn’t let anyone play thru. Called clubhouse but John was short with me. New starter tried, but it was too late."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Cart beeped incessantly (like it was too close to green) while parked ON PATH next to 9 green.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Took 21 minutes at turn to get a brat and beer.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Course layout is nice but conditions mediocre (burnt out tees, greens with marks all over it unrepaired). This place is not worth the $50 I paid on a HotDeal"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Crabgrass on the tee boxes is unacceptable. And it wasn’t just one of them. And lots of Indiana “Hardpan”. Never seen the course in such bad shape
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"I know it has been dry, but way too many Brown and overly Dry spots. And to charge $1 for a glass of water when there was no water on the course and it was 85 degrees out was just plain wrong. That dollar will cost u lots more when I call all other courses in the area to play and not yours"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Will play again. I liked that it is somewhat challenging. Greens, fairways, rough, and bunkers were all well maintained. The grass in all tee boxes was a little high, and there weren't a lot of tee boxes with level ground between feet and ball, which would be my main negatives. Cart paths are due for reconditioning, but that doesn't really bother me."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Greens were excellent. Nice old school layout. Enjoyed the round.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"I enjoyed the course layout, played the south 18, Good par 3s, long rough, decent greens overall. Will return."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Great fun on this course as always. The one thing that seemed to be notable was just how fast the greens are. Most likely due to the time of the season but it was difficult to get used to the speed at this time of year. My problem entirely and not that of the course.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Grass needs water and course could be great if returned to its original design intension. Fairway bunkers neglected.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Course was a good value for the money. Not the best place around, but priced right. Id come back again."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Pace of play was great (3hrs 45min on a Sunday), course conditions were nearly perfect despite the limited rain we’ve gotten over the past couple of months, and the course layout required more course management than most other courses around central Indiana, which was a nice change of pace for me. Definitely recommend and will be back to play again"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Tee boxes are bare and full of weeds. Do not recommend for the money.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Pebble Brook south is always a pleasure to play and always a challenge. The course is in very good condition. I would just hope that the greens will recover from some weather damage that has occurred this season but it’s clear that the course superintendent and his staff are doing the best they can to ensure the course remains in great shape.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"The starter was unfriendly and abrupt. Perhaps he was having a bad day, but not a good way to start the round. Otherwise the course is a great value and a good challenge."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Greens were in pretty good shape and rolled well. The course itself is struggling right now due to lack of water. Fairways okay, rough hard as a rock."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,One of the less expensive courses to play North of Indy. You get what you pay for.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Paying $52 dollars to play on this goat ranch is ridiculous. Some tee boxes covered with weeds. Fairways with dead spots on many holes. Many unplayable bunkers with weeds. They aerated the greens in mid June and didn't bother telling us before we drove across town to play here. I couldn't have been more disappointed. I used to play on the North and South courses frequently but it was many years ago and both courses were in very good shape. I don't know what's going on but this is a shame. Don't waste your money. You would do better at the local municipal for less money and better conditions. The weather has been perfect. There is no excuse for this.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Really like the back 9 on the South course. Nice sand traps. Fairways and rough were in good shape and fair. Cart paths need repair but I understand the cost.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Lot of maintenance needed. Was a nice. course but looks neglected now.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"The South Course needs a really good maintenance crew to come in, trim some trees, eliminate the dandelions, and make the course in general more beautiful. Even with a $44 “hot deal”, my playing partner and I both left very unimpressed. Pace or play was excellent, which makes sense given the course conditions. No ball washers or sand to fill divots with our cart. So much potential, I hope someone improves the condition (And I understand it’s April but this played worse than some city courses)."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Weather great. Course in great shape. Everyone happy to be out.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Great place to play, and will many times. Greens look better today, but still on the rough side."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,The lay out of the course is nice. The people that play there need to fix their pitch marks. The course really needs to fix some of the tee boxes. If you are looking for a decent course to play but I wouldn't pay more than 40 dollars I would recommend this course.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Great challenge, but very playable. Great course conditions and a solid plot of land. North Course is also fun to play, slightly easier."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"The greens have so many divots and the pace of play is very slow, but other than that it’s a nice play to play with friends. You’re just gonna have to wait and hope people let you play through."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Pace of play was poor. Greens really chewed up after long summer and heavy plsy
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,I’ve played here for years. Play most every week. The greens are becoming very torn up. Players aren’t repairing ball marks. Doesn’t appear the grounds crew fixes them either. Cart paths are in need of major repair. There’s no ball washers on the course. The clubhouse food quality has gone down since earlier this year. I’m sad that the quality of this facility has been reduced.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"First time playing this course. I think they need to mow down the weeds found in almost all the first cuts. The type of weeds with the white flowers, makes it hard to find the ball sometimes."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Sadly if the course wasn’t so wet it would have been an epic round
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Greens and fairways were in good shape. Very rough cart paths. Bunkers need sand
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Clubhouse improvements look very nice. The course is in bad condition. Weeds all around, Hard pan throughout fairways. Tee boxes are in bad shape. Appears less money should be spent in the clubhouse and more on the course. Definitely not worth $58 to play. Will not be back this year"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"The South Course is not in good shape. Cart paths are a mess, bumpy and huge holes of dirt to navigate around. The driving range looks like the ropes haven’t been moved in a long time…not much grass to hit off of. The kitchen is closed as they can’t get staff. The bar is open, but the person working there is NOT a mixologist, for sure. Someone took the flagstick off of #8. I went at the turn and told the staff and they acted like I was lying to them. “Are you sure? It was there when I played this morning.” Do they think I’d come in to tell them it was gone if it wasn’t? Or if I took it? There are other courses I’ll play, even though Pebble Brook is closest to me."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,The course was in the best shape I’ve experienced at pebble brook. Much improved over my previous rounds.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Tee boxes were like the moon. Put some sand and seed them. Fairways decent. Greens good. Paths need attention
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Most tees are in rough shape... need to be top dressed and leveled
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Had a great round on the south course today. I just started really playing golf last august and was impressed with the course conditions for not knowing what to expect for early spring. Dave in the pro shop was very friendly and welcoming and I look forward to more rounds there in the future. Thank you!
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Great mid fall weather. Course in good shape. Have kept their rates higher this fall than I remember in past years.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"The greens are in good shape for the time of year. Roll true. It’s not a hard course by any means. The sand traps need work, but I haven’t found a set of traps that are in good shape in the area this year."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Course was in good shape, smooth greens. Course was really firm. Pace was good until as 2nd group out in AM, got bogged down on back nine as a group who started on back nine held up first groups of day. Played first 14 holes in 2.5 hours. Took over and hour to play the rest. How can you let a 4 some jump in front of 2- twosomes before we made turn?"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Played this course many times. Great staff - Great course!
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,I have had issues with their staff for a long time. They all seem to act like you are putting them out by being there. Its one of the undesirable courses to go to in the area and they act like they are a private country club. Most of the staff are not very helpful.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Two golfers were ahead of my group. One drove while carrying both sets of clubs, and one walked... slow. The course was a typical busy Friday with nice weather which multiplied the traffic.The fairways and greens were in decent shape but just into the rough was crabgrass central.My group and I played Pebble Brook once before but last Friday was the last time. Too many other nice courses in Central Indiana.No drinking water on the course due to COVID-19, but the Clubhouse charged one of my golf mates to fill his water thermos -- tap water!Bye."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,The South Course is a Sporty and Challenging. It is a good course for all levels of Skill. From Beginner to Advanced. We will be back more often.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Tee boxes need some love. Wish people would fix divots. Greens rolled well except for that.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,The course was great we did 18 holes in less than 3 hours 3 of us . It was plenty challenging . Hole 10 on the south course it’s a little close to the driving range so there were a lot of balls on the fareway. Besides that it was great
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Half way through the round we got hit with a pop up storm. however by the end of the round you could barely tell it had rained course drained pretty well.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Course is in good shape and they have finished repairing all the bunkers.. Pace of play was excellent.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Got my 5:54 tee time at 5;:15 pm. Easy check in. Slightly congested at start due to league play starting at 6:00. Clear sailing by the turn. If I could have seen/found ball at 18 I would have had one of the, if not the best back 9 ever. Had to call it quits due to dark. Play PB, you will not be disappointed."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Greens were rolling greatAfter lots of rain remarkably good
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"I have played both Pebble Brook courses, and it is in the best shape I've seen, especially the greens. They were lightning fast and very true."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Very nice staff let us play even though course was very wet.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Reserved a tee time on golf now for two that included a cart. Got to the course and noticed a sign the said “walking only” due to Carona virus. I totally understand but I can’t walk and can’t get the course or golf now to help worthy rain check or refund.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"You get what you pay for and a little more with this course. Course was in great shape for the amount of rain we've had. I will certainly play there again, great bargain."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"I reserved a tee time a couple of days ago for two golfers with a cart. When we arrive, there is a sign noting “walking only” due to Carona Virus. I understand the issue but I can’t walk the course and the staff would not help with a rain check because tee time was made though Golf Now. Golf Now will not let me cancel due to the tee time being a “Hot Deal” even though the reservation clearly states that the golf cart is included. I wasn’t the only person that this happened to today."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,VERY FRUSTRATING!!!
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"The weather broke for a day and I got a great golf now price! The staff couldn't have been more friendly, as they always are, and the course was in great shape considering it was 11/10. The fairways were cut, leaves blown, and greens in as good a shape as you could expect for the time of year. There were not many golfers on the course and got done in 3 hours. Thank you Pebble Brook for participating with Golf Now and thank you for caring about the patrons and golf!"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Course in good shape. Greens were fast and pretty smooth. Fairways in good shape. Great day to play. Keep up the good work on the course. Always a pleasure to play.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Tee boxes in horrible condition. Greens are pretty good shape and can play pretty fast. Fairways have trouble with crabgrass later in the season. Great course for walking.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Nice day and good company with two other Golf Now customers. Course was fairly crowded but moved pretty well.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"This was a good round and the course was in good shape. What caused me concern was that Pebble Brook staff, when called by Golfnow about my claim for a raincheck, essentially ignored the fact that lightening and heavy rain came along right after our first 9. They refused to give authorization for a rain check because they did not ""close,"" even though most people had departed the course due to the weather."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Golfnow did a great job of providing us bonus certificates for future play that more than compensated us for our round, but it was disappointing that Pebble Brook did not own up to the conditions that made us leave the course. We simply could not wait around all day for better weather."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"The weather was perfect today and the course was in good shape. The greens played a bit fast, but overall, it was a good time."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Usually play the north course, this was the first time on the south. South Gets a lot of league play, so lots of ball marks on some greens, but generally in good shape. Several interesting holes, challenging elevation changes. A super friendly and helpful staff."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Always a nice round on P.B. North. A little weather worn, but a gem."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Sunday play due to low cost. Exceeded expectations. Greens good shape and good layout. Enjoyed for great value
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"It seems that the North Course gets more interest but I think the South Course is more deserving. It has a lot of character and can make for more memorable shots and holes, good or bad. Many of the holes require accurate positioning for your next shot, which sucks when you fail, but is so rewarding when you don’t. For the price, the conditions here are on point. Not on the level of Prairie View or Purgatory by any means but they don’t ask you to part with $90ish to play. Bunkers are usually great, greens firm and true, fairways hit or miss but playable. Great value. Play it a few times before you make a judgement. Knowing your way around this course can save more strokes than it can at most."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Really like the course layout/condition. USB ports in carts were nice!
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Course has many wet stops and has been torn up with the the rain.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Very pleasant. Better weather. We were a twosome and waited some on foursome ahead but not at all bad. Still finished in under 4 hrs. Course a little wet in spots but we’ve had a ton of rain so far. As usual, very good price."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Always enjoy this GC...top notch and great value!!!
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Very wet conditions - not the course’s fault - we have had lots of rain.They did allow us to ride the fairways except two holes.Lots of standing water but the fairways were firm underneath and got roll where there was no waterThe greens were firm - fast - and rolled smoothBest greens we have played and have played 38 times since Jan. 1 stThis is a very good course with all the challenge you want !BG
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"We booked a tee time at 8:09AM on Saturday May 4 at Pebble Brook - South. It rained all morning, the course was closed, and and we were unable to play. The course told me that I needed to contact Golfnow for a refund. I don't see on the web site any option for me to get a refund or credit for the $25.49 that I was charged. Please advise"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"The South course has some of the best greens anywhere around. The fairways were spotty, but it is early in the year.I would appreciate playing this course multiple times."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Great layout. Good condition for this time of year. The people working the bar and grill are awesome
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Very good early season round. Golf shot service excellent. Food was just OK. Course condition good for March. Solid value.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,For the amount of play this course gets....great value! Staff is nice...everything on point. Thank you Pebble Brrook..I'll definately be back.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Great golf course greens were fast the rough was rough we enjoyed playing
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Senior tees were not good. Not level. Lots of bare spots. Rest of course was nice.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Pebble brook is one of the best values in the city. Being nestled between Westfield Noblesville and Carmel it truly is a gem.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,First time playing this course and I was impressed. The course was fairly straightforward. The greens were the highlight for this time of year and at the price point. 10 had some dead streaks any one other hole was a scaled spot that was mitigated by pin placement.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Another fun round! Always enjoyable playing here.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Tee to green, great golf course. Enjoyed my round, looking forward to going back!"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Pretty wet this day, but very playable. Number of traps had water, but most courses in the area had same problem. Lots of rain earlier in the week. Played w/wife, 4some ahead let us thru at 9, so pace was good, and fee was great value. Course condition was fine considering all the play over the summer."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Nice course, friendly staff, enjoyable day! Even though the greens had recently been aeriated, they were healing and rolling smoothly!Thumbs up to the ranger for monitoring pace of play on the frontnine that allowed pace to be maintained!"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Great rates (with GolfNow rewards-$17 for two). The course was in great shape, Some waiting at the tee boxes for the next group, but it was a Saturday, mid-day tee time. The weather was brutal--105 heat index--but I can't blame the course for that. However, the snack house at the turn had plenty of ""fluids"" to get us through. Highly recommend this course especially the North."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Always fun to play Pebble Brook either north or south. The only reason I put down a 3star for the course condition was that many of the greens look to be in bad condition with large areas of the greens lacking grass due to what appears to be some kind of fungal attack. This is a shame and I hope it can be corrected soon.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Great timeWe had a great time playing the course the layout and the course was in excellent shape the staff was very friendly they paired us up with two people that was very nice we just had a great time
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Overall, the course was in decent shape. The fairways and teeboxes were good, along with most of the rough. Lots of ground under repair. The bunkers look nice, but are horrible; that is, they have almost no sand in them. The greens were not in great shape, but they were about what you would expect from Pebble Brook: good enough. Pace of play wasn't horrible, but it definitely could have been much better. The staff was helpful and made us aware of a junior event that would be behind us on the course so we weren't freaked out by all the little kids in brightly colored t-shirts."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Enjoyable round despite the heat. Course in pretty good shape despite no rain for awhile.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Challenging but very fair course. In great shape, I’ve heard this was a great track, and it lived up to its hype."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"This course was in good condition. Fairways and greens were very good, rough had tall grass making it hard to fine a golf ball, if you were unfortunate enough to hit into it. Overall, the course is moderate difficulty, making for an enjoyable round of golf."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Everything was good and would have given the course 4 or 5 stars all the way around but the greens were horribly slow... by far the slowest I’ve played on in years. For that reason. I won’t be going back
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Greens lightly top dressed caused some tough reads and speeds and 25-30 mph wind made the course even more challenging. Always a good time at Pebble Brook, North or South course."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Played the South Course. Front nine was slow, mostly due to a group of 4 young men who didn't follow the premise of ""ready golf"" .... a Marshall to speed them up would have been welcome. Course was in good shape, staff was very good. Had dinner in the clubhouse after our round and the food was quite good and our server was one of the best."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"First time playing the course, I didn’t know anyone in Indianapolis that has played the course. So I assumed it wasn’t a good track, Boy was I wrong. The staff was very friendly and as a single I was paired up with a twosome and we enjoyed a great round of golf. The course was in good shape the greens were running true and fast and the pin placement were challenging. Next time I’m in Indianapolis I will bring some friends along to enjoy the course. I plan on playing the North course. I was told it is a little more challenging than the south course."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Tony
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Course was in great shape. Sand traps had new sand except hole 10. Tee boxes need work. South Course
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Check in with Dave at the desk was great as usual. Pace of play till we got to 7 was OK. Was behind 2 kids that should take lessons. Then at the turn the kids got to play thru 2 foursomes of what I think was choose-ups and older guys that took forever. I am 68 and these guys acted like they were playing for $$$$$$. 4 hours to play a 2some and ride is ridiculous.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Played both Pebble Brook Courses a bunch of times over the last 3 years, and can say the North course today was as good as I've ever seen it. Greens rolled true, and all the bunkers had nice, fresh sand (except on 17 which is perpetually a flooded problem). Impressive coming out of the rough winter, well worth a go as the season starts."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Nice course, friendly staff. Course was too wet to allow carts, but was open to walkers. Very adequate and the course was right to not allow carts out. Lots of puddles. Thanks to PebbleBrook forallowing play at all."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"I was in from out of town, and since I had the day off work, I didn't care what the weather was like...I had to play golf today. The high temperature was 31. I didn't want to play one of the more higher priced courses around the area when it was only 31 outside. I just wanted to play some place where I could enjoy the round, swing the club, and that was about it. I picked Pebble Brook because of it's location and because I played it before. It was a decent course in the summer, and with the price, I thought I'd give it a shot. When I got there, I played the south course and I was the only person on the entire 18 holes. I played in 2 hours and 15 minutes. The greens and fairways were in outstanding shape, especially for this time of year. I was very pleasantly surprised. When I was finished with my round, I hit the bar at the clubhouse. The people at the club house were beyond friendly. The food was great, and so was the conversation. If you are looking for a course that is well kept, maybe not too difficult, friendly, and affordable, I recommend this place in a heartbeat."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,A little annoyed at starter who pulled up right when I was addressing my tee shot on 1st hole and asked our name and tee time . After I gave it to him he then asked for all of our receipts. We then get to 2nd hole and it's all backed up because they have about 4 twosomes on the course right in front of us.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"The course was in good condition, except they need to add sand to most of the bunkers. It was like playing out of ground under repair. The bunker on 10 had rocks bigger than my golf ball and no sand at all.Other than that it was a good round."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Fairways and green are in very good condition. Tee boxes are in fair condition.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Nice course, friendly staff, beer special.What more can you ask for!"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Wife and I played the South course early. Just over 3 hrs. Course in nice condition. Weather perfect.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Lots of pits made by golf carts by the tees due to over watering-fill those holes in and quit watering the tees!! They don't go over the greens to remove the dew so you get a rooster-tail on every putt--not good! Great course --could be better1
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,For the money and convenience of location this was a great value
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Great course to play for the money. It was in good shape, greens were nice and it had some nice challenging holes. Definitely would play it again."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Played the South course this time, first time this year. Personally, I like the North course better. The South is tight, and you play position a lot, especially on the back 9."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"The tee boxes are really chewed up, and some fairways were spotty. Sand is rocky hard pan - they really need a complete overhaul on both courses. Greens were decent though. The course could really use a ranger, as it took us about 40 min to play the first 2 holes, then after we were waved through and one of that group joined us instead we never saw the twosome we left behind again (and we were a foursome). So anyone that was stuck behind them had a long morning, and this course has a reputation for slow play. The GPS on the cart was off all day as well - several times it would say the hole was in the front when it was in the back and vice versa. I do like that the cart has USB ports to keep the phone charged."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"All in all, you can do worse, but you can do better too. It's in the league of Fox Prairie and Stony Creek around Noblesville, and I'd pick either of them first. Though I'd play Pebble Brook anytime over Brookshire."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"If the tee boxes on the South Course is any indication of what's to come, heaven help us. Need to enforce spineless shoes."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,I have played this course many times. This round was better as I got hooked up with a good player and the pace was much better than in the past. It was almost wide open for a change.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"It's been several years since I've played PB, almost to the point, with few exceptions, I really didn't remember the track. Well, the reintroduction was better than expected. It's a solid parkland layout with several memorable, challenging holes. Conditions are decent, except for a few bare spots, and most bunkers need some love. Both are forgivable, given the time of year and how much rain we've gotten in central Indy. In addition to several superior holes, the greens deserve some kudos, they are fast, true and treacherous. If you are above the hole, you're likely to be stroking a 3rd putt. All in all, a good golf experience, and I will be back much sooner this time!"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"I like both these courses ant the staff is great. Nice to see all the work being done on the course. Cart paths need repaired but all in all course is in good shape. My only complaint is the water containers were all empty. We played from about noonish till 4pm and it was pushing 90 degrees. I am sure they started out full but that kind of heat will make it be used fast. Just suggest checking on them more when that hot, Nice fokes and nice course."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"The course is pretty basic, no signature hole, nothing about the course is really memorable. It's been dry recently but it's evident they haven't watered the course at all. The greens were so firm they couldn't receive even a wedge shot. After the first three holes we just started playing the yardage to the front of the green and hoping the ball wouldn't release over the back. I understand it's a relatively cheap course to play but even a cheap course needs to be playable and this was not. I won't be back."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Love playing both courses at Pebble Brook. Great course especially for the money. However, this is the fourth time I've played there this year and all 4 times there has been 0 water to drink on any of the holes. Not a gigantic deal but when it's almost 90 degrees, I believe having water on your golf course is essential."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,We had an excellent round. GPS on golf carts was a great addition to our experience.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"All of the bunkers have been re-done (17 is still under repair but should be completed as soon as the weather allows) and many new tee boxes have been built and are in play. Fun course, nice complement to the older, tighter South course."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Course was in great shape. Only complaint was the half-way house did not accept cards. They have in the past so it was a bit of a let-down as I never carry cash on me.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Wonderful course, windy and wet on the day we played."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,This place is always in great shape. The staff is friendly and the price is very reasonable. Both the north and the south courses are fun and challenging!
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Anytime you can play golf this time of year when it's 65 degrees, you do it. The course was in decent shape for the winter. Tee markers would've been nice though, as would've scorecards on the carts or at the first tee. Greens rolled fantastically for February."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"The (north) course itself has some interesting holes, but it's not a layout that will knock you out, with a lot of back and forth doglegs and greens that slope fairly hard back to front for the most part. You don't come back to the clubhouse at the turn, though there is a halfway shack. Take a few extra drinks and a snack with you when you start."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Altogether, there are a lot worse options around the area in the same price range. It's worth a go for a nice relaxing round with friends, especially at the hot deal rate on golfnow."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Truly awesome course, especially for the price. Played here twice now towards the end of this season and the place is in immaculate condition. The course had already taken up all the yardage signs, water coolers, and ball washers, but that was to be expected this late in the season. The fairways and greens were very green and lush. The rough is playable but a nice assortment of well placed trees and bunkers (fairway and green side) make sure you pay a penalty for errant shots. High spin shots were well received by the greens but low punch and run shots were in play as well with a surprisingly soft but bouncy fairway. Greens were fast but fair and matched the putting green speeds. New carts with new gps units. The course was packed but even though the front took 2:25 it opened up on the back and we finished just over 4 hours with 3 of us. The first outing weeks prior there were zero issues with pace. Friendly staff and a well stocked bar with a mini-clubhouse between 9 and 10 that was also well stocked with food and drinks. Considering comparable courses around the north side struggled with condition and pace this season this course was a pleasant surprise. Overall not an extremely challenging course but we did play the white tees. Tips would have brought more fairway bunkers into play that we were able to hit over. Can't wait to play it in 2017."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,This is an amazing course. It has just enough difficulty from the tips to challenge even the scratch golfer. The greens are consistent and fast. The course plays true.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,I recommend this course for anyone looking to have fun and a challenge.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"I thought the fairways, rough, and sand were very well groomed. Tee boxes were a little rough and the greens were, for the most part, very good. Pretty quick greens. The course is challenging but not to the point that it becomes frustrating. Some beautiful holes on this course. I will be back."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Pace of play was awful! '2 Novice golfers ahead of us who later hooked up with another twosome, neither with enough golf etiquette to let us play through.We did not even have enough time to complete our round."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Staff was unfriendly and did not provide any guidance.Such a shame because the course is in great condition and could really be a great place with just a little more customer service.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,$31 for 2 18 hole rounds with a cart......awesome. GPS yardage on cart included
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Course condition is pretty good overall...work being done on most greens which has a tendency to alter your putts.The senior tee boxes are just okay...not level like the back tees...fareways and ruffs are all good. Overall they do anice job keeping both the courses in good playable condition...traps are unfriendly given the (often times) hard sand.Majority of public courses have lousy sand anyway....I recommend these courses. They are fun to play and notoverly challenging but not overly,easy either...it's a good value....staff is very friendly and the snack bar is well stockedwith numerous choices. I have always enjoyed playing these 2 courses."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"A couple friends and myself played this course recently and we had a great time. It had recently rained, but the course was in decent shape. I found the combination of water, trees, and distance to be enjoyable."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,A few bad spots around the greens.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Nice course for the money. Greens were in good shape and rolled smooth
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Great course. Excellent bang for the buck. Course is is much better condition than last year. I don't typically drink while playing, but was surprised that there wasn't a beer cart floating around. There is definitely money to be made there. Pace of play was on the slow side but not horrible...4hr and 20 min."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Both the South and the North courses seem to get better every year. For the price, you can't find a better course around Indy. The carts are brand new, with USB ports and GPS. There is a driving range. The staff is extremely friendly. The condition of the course is very nice and always well kept. I would consider the South course a shot makers course, but the North has challenges of its own, with new bunkers this year."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,You will not find a better course for an average of $28 on the weekdays after 3pm. I highly recommend you play it if you haven't.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Probably a year ago I would have said Pebble Brook was a 2 to 2.5 star course. The carts were old and terrible and the bunkers were infested with weeds and rock hard. Now, they have some of the most amazing new carts and almost all of the bunkers have been redone and are like new! Kudos to whoever was behind this. I now easily give this course 4 stars and for the value for the $$$ paid it is 4.5- 5 stars. Great job Pebble Brook!"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Decided to play this course as I was staying in the edition. Pretty decent course, couple of the greens were in pretty rough shape. If I had the chance to play again, I would probably play the North course as I've heard it's nicer. I played 18 in about 2.5 hours by myself so pace was good."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Extremely friendly and welcoming! :)
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Great time was had by all
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Not the best club in town, but a solid value that seems to be being managed quite well. The bunkers need much help and I think they are addressing this. The course layout is interesting. Most times I play this course the greens are in very good shape, largely due to them rolling the greens.....Not the best track in town, but a solid option!"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,No issues. Course was in good shape
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"This place is great. I've only played the South course, but they both look amazing. Very challenging layout, but fairways and greens were pristine."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"It was a chilly start but as the sun came out for most of the morning, things turned out really nice. Some areas were still fairly muddy, but overall course was very playable. Tee boxes and greens were in great shape, just wish more players would take care of their ball marks."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Staff and employees are extremely friendly. Bar and waitresses are wonderful. Fairways are in decent shape. Sand bunkers are being worked on after many years of usage. 2016 should be a banner year for Pebblebrook with all the work being done on the course. Good job.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Greens were in very good shape and fast. Fairways and rough were nicely mowed. Course was drying out thus helping the ball to run on fairways. Pro shop well equipped and grill/bar had a good selection of beverages with good sandwiches. Overall pleasantly pleased, for the price."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,i love it and the greens were hard!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,It took us over an hour and a half to play four holes. We had to constantly wait on the group in front of us because they were waiting on people in front of them. The group behind us and behind them were waiting as well. Extremely slow play. Lost the enjoyment.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,This is a great course enjoyed it 100 percent I would like to play it again soon
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Course is well laid out, easy to move around for first time player. Cart had GPS included which was really so helpful in understanding hole layout and distances. Hasn't rained here in weeks and the grass was green but dry as a bone and the there was a lot of roll so i picked up distance , but impossible to hit under the ball and take a divot, so the club just bounced off the ground some times. Not much water or sand, the fairways are open and forgiving. I have been struggling of late and it was nice to play a course where you can relax and swing away. I used Golfnow and played mid-afternoon and it was wide open for me. Its a simple course where you can enjoy the day and walk away feeling like you played ok"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Course was a little crowded and slow but pace of play picked up after front 9. Greens fast as they were drying out in the late afternoon.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,pace of play was horrendous. I guess you get what you pay for.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Course and staff are great. The condition of the course is excellent. My only complaint is that we had two rude players behind us that kept hitting into the areas we where hitting. We had a foursome in front of us that was playing slow.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Course was good as always. Played it for 35 years Did NOT appreciate the $5 charge for booking on line!!
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"First time on the South Course, and only played 9-holes. We've had miserable, rainy weather the entire month of June. It was nice to see the course in such good shape after all the rain. You could see where there were issues with standing water on some hole earlier in the week, but with all the rain, the folks at PB can only do so much. The day I played, the weather couldn't have been more perfect, and the greens were true, sand was good (a couple of standing water bunkers), fairways were in great shape. Pace of play was fine with no waiting.I enjoy Pebble Brook and will play there again."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Not worth it. Employee didn't show up until 7 on father's day.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Good condition, good greens. Good value on golfnow. A very nice course all around."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,I played the day after a good rain so the course was soggy but the greens were in great shape and fast. The sand was hard packed due to the rain.The nineth and tenth holes are not at the club house so make sure you have plenty of snacks and drink. A snack shack was not open and a soft drink machine provided did not work.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"The course website describes it as a ""links-style course,"" which is quite a stretch. Most of the fairways are pretty wide-open, though, so it's a place where a weekend hacker can rip away and not have to worry about lost balls. Very few houses are around which is a rarity in value suburban Indiana courses.Fairways and greens in good condition. Only real negative is that there are a lot of bunkers- some are in good condition, many are ""under construction"" and gnarly. If this bothers you, pay twice as much or more to play at a premium course."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,We purchased a deal online and it was our first time playing this course. We all enjoyed it and felt it was well worth the money!!
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Would have to say I have played this course half a dozen times and this is the best the course has ever been. From tee to free and especially the greens. We're running about a 9 but smooth to run out. Booked on golfnow for $17 dollars. Great find and great course. Would have paid 35-40 to play
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"This is a nice course and one I play frequently. It is relatively open, so if you scatter off the tee you will have a good opportunity to find your ball and get it to the green without too much of a penalty. The ability to work the ball is helpful on a few holes."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,The bunkers on the North course are currently being repaired or rebuilt. I talked with a couple of employees in the club house and they said the effort is to flatten the bunkers out since it is difficult to maintain them in the current configuration. This makes many bunkers unplayable for the time being and it will likely take a good year before they are back in good shape.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"This course has it all. It's challenging, well kept, fun, and has a great flow. First time playing this course and the only thing that I could see that was needed was some attention to the course. It's early in the year so I would love to play this course during the fall to see what it looks like. All in all its a must play."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"I booked the South course but when I arrived the staff was very friendly and said I could play either. I've only played the south because a friend told me the north wasn't worth it. He was very wrong. While the back nine of the south is the best nine, the whole north course is pretty nice. They are repairing a lot of it (I was out there again today and a lot of maintenance was being done), but all the holes are pretty fun to play. It's challenging for a long driver like myself who has a pretty bad 80-100yds out game. Really made me work to get on the green."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Played this course on a beautiful, warm, sun shiny afternoon and it was delightful. Course is in great shape, the clubhouse attendant was very friendly and helpful, and the post round Sun King beer very cold. What more can you ask for in a golf round ?"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Greens were very sandy for indiana. The cart paths were In bad shape. Overall the each hole had great challenges and had fun. The north coarse not my favorite because 1-18 are so far from the clubhouse. Make sure you have refreshments for the entire round
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"I played the South course, and I have to say that playing the front and back were like playing two different courses. The front nine is unimpressive in both design and conditioning (fairways had bare spots and were kind of chunky). On the other hand, the back nine is in much better shape and a way more interesting golf experience. After being disappointed in the front side, I was unexpectedly delighted with the back. Despite being recently top dressed, the greens on both sides rolled really well."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"As a first time player at Pebble Brook, I would have to say that I was slightly disappointed that there wasn't more information available to the golfer with regard to the layout of the course and individual holes. Lots of doglegs, so I had to go on a scouting mission on a number of holes to figure out where the greens were in relation to the tees or approaches. The GPS in the carts (yardages only), though, were big help and a nice addition."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"I picked up a last minute deal for a great rate on the South Course. Upon my arrival, the staff was extremely friendly and very helpful. I ended up playing the North Course for two reasons. First, there was a high school match being played on the South Course and second, they had just aerated the greens a few days before. Also, the staff mentioned that the North course wasn't busy and I shouldn't have any trouble getting the round in before dark."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"The course itself was in excellent condition. The greens were firm and a little bumpy from being aerated the week before, but they were definitely playable. Fairway grass was in good condition for a late summer round and the rough was, well, rough - thick and fairly deep in spots."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"The course offers electric carts that include a GPS system that indicates yardage to the front, middle and back of the greens as well as yardage to various hazards on the hole. Cart paths are in good shape overall. However, if you prefer to walk, the layout makes for a great day walking."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Just a note for those of you who like to grab a snack or drink at the turn - this course does not come home after hole 9. There are, however, restrooms and a soda machine between 9 and 10 out on the course."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Course was generally in fair shape. Fairways OK to sparse. Greens had just been aerated (but not rolled) and we were NOT warned of this when we made our reservation. Those bumpy aerated greens made putting an adventure.Most of the sand traps were bad. Very little sand and several had large (3+"") rocks scattered in them. Not pebbles- these were small ROCKS that could easily damage a club or even pose risk of personal injury (e.g. to hands/wrists from striking one or being hit by one inadvertently launched during an explosion shot). IMHO- Absolutely no excuse for not having these strained out of the bunker sand.Obviously pace of play depends on the specific day, but we waited literally every single hole and saw NO marshals while we were there."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,I did not buy any food or drinks so not fair of me to grade that part. Course was in over all good shape water features where beautiful!
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,I enjoyed the course with my sons. It was in great shape. We had breathing room for most of the round. Staff was friendly and courteous-- very important to me.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Great Course. Always in great condition. Almost always has a great rate of play. Staff is awesome. I love Pebble Brook. I personally recommend the South Course, but either are good."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Fun and challenging with some great doglegs. This course has been around for many years and they maintain it nicely. Great course for the money.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Course tees and rough and in great condition. Greens need lots of work to get a more true roll. Fairways need thicker grass.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Having 36 holes available to play opens up both courses. Two of us rode and played the South course in 2 hours and 50 minutes. Really enjoyed it and will return.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,I played 18 holes in under 2 hours. People were friendly and the greens were true.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Weather looked like it might rain but never did. No group behind us until the 18th. Course and greens were in good condition.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Great staff! I am an amputee and they make me feel welcome every round! I actually was able to play 18 with my prosthetic on and shot 85 and had a bird. I playing the North course today.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Overall layout is great and presents a fair challenge. Bunkers, however, were nearly unplayable."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Went to check in for the tee time and staff was rude, acting like we bothered them. Snack bar was slow and question legality of my I.d. and told me that I needed a new license to not confuse them. Pace of play was fairly slow and course conditions were fair. Overall a pretty poor experience however."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Overall a good course, but it could be better. I have seen this course in better shape than it was in yesterday. Unfortunately, my biggest complaint is that there was no urgency whatsoever for people to maintain any pace of play. I spent most of the first six hole stuck behind three foursomes and another twosome, and NONE of them were willing to let me through. (I was playing by myself.) Finally, after spending more time sitting in my cart waiting for the people in front of me to get clear than actually playing golf, I decided to jump ahead where I could play at a faster pace and then come back and play 7 and 8 at the end of my round. My game had stopped and started so much at that point that I played horrible and just packed up and went home after the 12th hole. I've played this course numerous times in the past, but it is MUCH more enjoyable during the week. :("
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Tee off at 10:30am as a single and passed a group on the third hole and then had the course to myself. Proshop is stocked up and staff is friendly. I think having younger people behind the cash register is a pleasant change from the cranky old man I get at Gray Eagle Golf Club.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,My only complaint that I have have with this place time and time again is how slow the snack bar is. Nobody in line and no body behind the counter and then they take so long to ring up a coke.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,I am used to playing countless courses in sunny South Florida but was recently visiting the Indianapolis area and was treated to this gem. I can see without hesitating that this course and it's staff trumped every course I have played down here.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,The new owner was EXTREMELY personable and it is obvious he has great plans for Pebble Brook's future.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Can't wait to play this course again!
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Pebble Brook is a great course. Beautiful layout and always in good condition. Staff is always friendly and accommodating!
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"We had to wait over 10 minutes before someone came to the check in desk. There was another gentleman waiting there as well. Finally, a UPS driver came in and located someone to sign for a delivery. Once on the course, we had a bit of confusion as to where the tees were by color. Blue tees were mixed up with the white ones. On three tees, the marker blocks were off to the side of the tee box (red tees). On one tee, we had to move up to Gold because the sprinklers were turned on where the Blue and White tees were. We did play fast, only having to allow two singles to play through. Other than that, a pretty uneventful round"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"The course was in good shape considering no much rain. I haven,t played this course in many years. The trees have grown and some changes make it more enjoyable to play and more challenging."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Nice course, friendly staff. I will play here again soon. Good value for the money."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,This course was in fairly good condition. The greens were very fast despite it just having rained. Not anything that was very memorable here.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"This was the first time playing the North course and I loved it. All the holes offered a different challenge, look and feel. There were a few spots on the the tee boxes that needed some help but other than that the course was in great condition."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"My husband and I played the South course. They also have a North course. We enjoy playing the North course more than the South course. From the red and white tees the South course plays about 400 yards longer. We are both 60 years old and could not reach the greens in regulation on the South course, thus the reason we enjoy the shorter course. The pace of play was fantastic. We will definitely be returning but will be playing the North course."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Pebble Brook South is a great course with a wonderful staff. The greens are relatively fast and very consistent. Due to this year's cooler weather the rough is thick, which makes finding the fairway important."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"the course was in good shape, no complaints. I would like to see the north couse open there snack shack so u could get food and drink after 9 holes"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"The course layout is not too demanding for novice golfers, but also offers some challenges for all levels. I'd recommend you give this course a look. This review is for the South Course, but they also feature another 18-hole North Course."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,Nice course that is well maintained for the price :-)
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"This was a good round in the afternoon. Not many people were on the course, so it was nice to play quickly. The course was in pretty good shape as well."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,We played the South Course and it was a nice round. Very quick and many clubs to hit. Lots of doglegs that require knowledge of the course to know where to hit.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"The course seemed quite empty so you didn't feel any pressure to play faster or rush a read on a putt. I didn't see hardly anyone. The course had these pesky biting flies but that's the only real complaint. Some tee boxes were in great shape and others not so much. Had I not gotten a great deal at golf now .com and paid full price, the course would not have been worth the money"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"The normal rate for PebbleBrook would be far too high, but Golfnow rates are about right for this course. It has a fun layout and is fairly well maintained. For the right price I would definitely recommend this course for an outing with friends."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"This course is laid out very well compared to many other courses in the same price range. However, many of the greens need attention due to some disease. I am probably more budget conscious than most when it comes to paying for golf, so the $45 price tag on a week day at 2pm was a little steep for my liking. HOWEVER, if you can utilize the Golf Now deal for $10, this might be the best value for golf I've ever experienced."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,7 HDCP
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Layout of Pebble Brook South Course has always been a favorite of mine. South gives you a great mix of straightforward holes and holes that require thoughtful positioning of shots. Greens would have recieved a perfect grade, but a small issue on middle right portion of #12 green, which should recover this season and only accounts for 5% of the total green area, prevented a blanket ""noteworthy"". It's still early in the season, and South is a mature track so should be just fine. Mid to upper-mid tier course that has the potential to be a top tier track."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Our foursome played the south course. Like a lot of courses, it had it share of damage due to the summer heat and dry conditions. Most of the courses have come to life, but not this one. Tee boxes were so damaged, most of the par 3's had little to no grass to hit from. The greens all had areas of brown out, down to the dirt. I could live with some of it, had they placed the pins in spots on the green away from the damaged areas. The scorecard did not have hole layouts, and there were no layouts on the tee boxes. We were left guessing where holes were and which way the dog legs run, etc."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"The course was in great shape except for the greens. They had several burnt out spots, some aeriatied, some not. Leaves were not a problem even though they have a plithera amount of trees throughout the course, and it is'that time of the year!"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"The in-cart GPS features makes this course more enjoyable. It's nice to play a course like this with the in-cart GPS (so that you don't have to use your phone or device which slows the round for others). You know exact yardage on every shot and it makes everything more enjoyable. The course is in decent shape overall, however, the sand in the bunkers could use some attention (or just don't hit it in the sand). The driving range has 3 flags that I would assume are 100, 150, and 200. More targets would make it better. I have it 4 stars overall because it is a great value. The sand and some of the greens/tees/fairways having burnt-out patches due to the severe drought this year prevent it from being a 5."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Played the North course. I realize the drought affected all courses in the area, but the North course was in the worst shape I have seen a course in years. Perhaps all the maintenance money is going toward the South course?"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"I understand we had little rain, but they should have lowered rates based on the condition of the course."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - South Course,571-pebble-brook-golf-club-south-course,"Between the North & South courses, you get a taste of almost every golfing situation. Plenty of doglegs, some wide open and some narrow fairways, some water hazards and well placed bunkers. It's a USA style course but some of the holes do have a ""link-ish"" fel to them."
Hickory Bend Golf Course,5990-hickory-bend-golf-course,"I've driven past Hickory Bend several times, and finally decided to stop. It's a short 9 hole goat ranch style course with very tiny greens. Even with their small size, a lot were slightly elevated and they were all slower than my living room carpet. Most of the cups did not have a defined edge, so they were in that spot for a while. Rest of the course was mostly crabgrass. The rough and fairway could be discerned by a slightly lower mow of the same kind of (crab) grass. Tees were pretty chewed. That said I played 9 holes in about 35 minutes, so if you need a quick round it's not bad. Not worth the $18 to ride 9 though value-wise. But would be a very easy course to walk. Good course for beginners too. You can do worse at this level of course, but you can do better too."
Hickory Bend Golf Course,5990-hickory-bend-golf-course,"For a quick 9 holes, I would highly recommend. Tee boxes are in rough shape, but impressed with the condition of the fairways and the greens were in great shape. Greens were slow, but had some challenging undulations and were very small, so the approaches were very difficult. No water or sand, but strategic uncut rough and small greens make this a great practice course. Very friendly staff, great price and few other golfers make this my preferred choice to get a quick round of 9 in."
Hickory Bend Golf Course,5990-hickory-bend-golf-course,"A 9 hole course not targeted at avid golfers. No real fairways or man made hazards. With the exception of green placement I wouldn't say this course was ""designed"". You will find yourself hitting off dirt or sparse grass off the fairways sometimes. Consistently uneven tee boxes. Super slow greens. Always wide open so a great place for practice."
Sagamore Golf Club,24896-sagamore-golf-club,"The Good: Sagamore Club is a pristine, visually intimidating Jack Nicklaus signature design that is his only in the greater Indianapolis area. A fairly recent design (2003), it has distinct features similar to other midwestern designs built in the same time period (Bull at Pinehurst Farms, Harbor Shores). While the design isn’t overly strategic, it is absolutely gorgeous, with water features on most of the Par-3’s and Par-5’s, making for a chance to lose a ton of balls throughout the round. Fairways were as smooth as carpet and the rough (being grown out for an NCAA event later in May) was major championship challenging. Fabulous greens that hold well and aren’t overly undulated, making them fairly benign compared to most Nicklaus tracks. Excellent clubhouse with expansive dining and bar area, as well as nice practice area."
Sagamore Golf Club,24896-sagamore-golf-club,"The Bad: I wouldn’t consider Sagamore a “fun course”, but more one that is uber penal if you miss a shot. While there is plenty of room off the tee, Sagamore is one of the more difficult approach shot golf courses I’ve played and can be a too tough a slog for the mid-high handicapper. The greens were almost TOO slow for my liking but did putt true. The professional golf staff was very accommodating at check-in, however they was no on-course service to be found."
Sagamore Golf Club,24896-sagamore-golf-club,The Verdict: The Sagamore is an excellent golf experience designed for the low handicap player. It is one of the more aesthetically impressive courses in Indiana that I’ve played – likely in my Top 3 in the state.
Sagamore Golf Club,24896-sagamore-golf-club,"Best Hole: Hard to argue with many of the holes, particularly on the closing half, but the short Par-5 18th is really a showstopper. A cape-style tee design that forces players to decide how much water to cut off with their drive. Too far right and you’re in traps (or worse, like me) or too far left and you’re swimming. Nice approach to a green guarded by water left."
Sagamore Golf Club,24896-sagamore-golf-club,Super layout. Nicklaus design. All the course you want.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"I selected Saturday 10/5 to play golf with my son and friends home from college, using Golf Now. Get to the course today and they had no reservation. Apparently your calendar reverted to the current day after I selected Saturday. I paid $168 and didn't play golf, so I can't trust this site again."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"I feel bad, I know they've been hit with some draughts but the North course had some holes in really bad shape. Not just burnt greens but burnt fairways that were so dark black/brown they were unplayable in those spots.Super friendly staff inside the clubhouse and the starter was great as well. The turn shack was open, which was surprising on a Monday but the brat and hotdog were burnt like some of the fairways."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,I should have taken some pics but I did not.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Nice improvements to the North course. Asphalt cart paths finally. Traps could use some sand. Greens in good shape. Nicely renovated restaurant
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,I played the North course. The course is in great shape. Fairways and tee boxes are in excellent shape. It’s a very fair course but you gotta keep the ball in play. Love the layout. I will definitely be playing this course again!
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"This was our first time playing this course.We played the north course The course layout was very fair, yet somewhat challenging. Large mature trees lined the outside of the course. We were the first ones off the tea. Which made peace play wonderful, got 18 holes in 3 and a 1/2 hours. Looking forward to playing this course again."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Course was well maintained for the majority of the holes. The gps on the carts was at first a nice touch though unnecessary. However, it became obnoxious as it would continuously buzz at you for driving in parts of the fairway."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"I really like the layout, condition and the. Halle get this course offers. Great staff and well worth the cost"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Great layout, lush fairways and no delays during play. Greens were very hard and fast. Overall a great. Purse"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"I've played this course many times and not sure it's been in such bad shape. greens beat up and t boxes rough. Seems like watered too much too. Cart paths about broke the cart! A group of 8 golfers playing a scramble were really slow, finally let us through but all in all rough day on a course I've really enjoyed before..."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Pebblebrook is a gem. With 2 18 hole courses they can provide many tee times. They keep the course in good condition -with the amount of play the courses receive I’m certain it is not an easy task!The staff is always friendly and accommodating!
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"The course is challenging. My only criticism is the cart paths are a wreck in most place. We found ourselves driving on the grass to avoid the cart paths. Despite that, I always have a great time at Pebble Brook North."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"The course is in reasonably good shape! The tee boxes are a little rough, but the fairways and greens are nice. There were all levels of play out there today, from novice players to scratch golfers. They tend to frustrate or intimidate each, but pace of play was good. 85 degrees, sun, and nice breeze made it a good round."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"The layout is just fine. It presents challenges on each drive and approach. There is enough water and trouble to make it challenging. However, the club house is a dump. It always smells like urine in the men's locker. The drinks are more expensive than craft cocktails from local distilleries. The greens are kind of smooth but inconsistent. There are large areas of problem grass all over the course. The cart paths are an absolute nightmare. Luckily, for local residents, they understand the problems and charge a fair price."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Played with a member and his son who had great insight of the course it was great round when you play with members and all they have to say is positive things of the course and the staff tells you everything. Most of the holes are drivers friendly obviously not the Par 3 water isn’t a issue. The greens where a lil bouncy b/c other ppl failed to fix the divot’s. The length of the rough was great and the sand in the bunkers where soft. The North course you have to get a golf cart to play meaning you can’t walk, it’s done to play in a fast pace. The next visit will be to play the South how ever the members said both courses are similar the big difference is you can walk the South course."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Great Sunday afternoon of golf, hot deal made for a great deal. Course has rangers. Carts were equipped with GPS and were modern and comfortable. Course has a decent modern layout and a cantina with bathrooms at the break.However, with all those amenities the course is only in ok-good condition. The course by my house is in better shape.Needs a better grounds keeper, fairways are in decent-good, but not great condition. Lots of fescue that could easily be mowed. Greens could be in much better shape.It could be a 5* course. It's not though."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Clearly Pebble Brook has decided to start caring for the courses and the staff is as friendly as ever. Only real concern is over the lack of water and ball washers on the course. This is no longer COVID era.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"First time playing, was crowded due to Indy 500 weekend but play was just a little slow. Nice layout, fairway blunders on a lot of holes. Greens were ok but some had issues, I personally found them to be very fast. Would definitely play there again and try the South course."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Only complaint I would have isn't on the staff or the greens crew but it seems most of the south course greens suffered horribly from golfers who didn't know how or didn't care to take the time to fix ball marks on the greens. Leaves a tuff situation for the turf staff and a shame because the greens are really to nice for that treatment. I'm guessing was worse than normal due to wet spring but still, fix your ball marks guys help the course out."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Definitely coming back.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,The course was in good condition and the greens far exceeded expectations. This one is the best value course in the greater Indy area
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Poor golfer but excellent experience. Last played there in mid-80s. Entire area shines as a nice place to live and golf.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"I was able to get a great deal with some discount codes and a “hot deal”, and wound up playing 18 for $9 with a cart. It was a really windy and chilly day, but for it being winter, the course was in pretty darn good condition. There were some small rough spots on the greens, but they were still good for winter in Indiana"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,I played the South course last year and it was in BAD shape. I hadn’t been there since but decided to give the facility another shot. The North was great. Fast greens on a windy day made It tough but the conditions were as good as you could hope for this time of year. I had a great experience. Brought back memories of the old days when I played here at least once a week.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Enjoyed playing here again and had a good round. Only issue I’d raise is the condition of the greens. Pretty matted down and spotty - prob due to amount of play.I’ll still go back!! Enjoyed it.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Love Pebble Brook - Great staff and fun course to play!
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Good Hot Deal rate. Temp in 70’s. Pace under 3 hrs.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,The course is busier than you might think. There are some tournaments and school teams and also some highly empowered seniors who are members. They don’t play well with others. They are in bunches of slow foursomes. You can’t get around them and you can’t get through them . So you have to account for them. Maybe it’s the same everywhere? North is the better layout but only by a little bit. South has 4 or 5 Mickey Mouse holes. North has maybe 2 or 3. I like the facility.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,The course was in very good condition. Playing time was fast. Everybody at the course was very friendly and helpful. I will definitely be back and Pebblebrook golf course again.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Have made the North course my main play this summer. It's well designed and well maintained. And other than a bit of chewed up tee boxes and some less-than-sandy bunkers, I'd say PB has handled the summer of 22 quite nicely. And the rate, well, PB don't go raising it anytime soon...say this fall when I'll be back in FL. :)"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Unfortunately, I can relay that the traps are in good shape-especially for late in the season."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Looked like heat and lots of play has made for bad greens conditions Too bad as love this course
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Overall a pretty solid course. Avoid the rough at all costs or you'll get much less enjoyment out of playing here than you would hope for. Beautiful Par 3's and a great off-course amenties. Would play again for a good deal.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Nice shape for a public course. Traps had sand and were raked. Greens were a little slow. Cart paths are rough
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Overall great course for price, layout, staff, and conditions."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,I always have a good experience when I play this course. If people would just take the time to treat the greens a little better I wouldn’t have a complaint about the course
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"The course layout and natural scenery are awesome. Pictures can’t capture the true essence but we tried. The course was challenging for the more experienced of our group and for me, not being as experienced. We will definitely be back. It’s worth the experience!!!"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,The bar/restaurant was closed. Tee time 11:20. There were 6 people on the tee box in front of us at 11:20. They did not tell us they had 2 outings scheduled ahead of us. We played 9 holes in 3 hours and 15 minutes and decided to quit. One of our threesome quit after 3 holes and asked if he could get a credit because of the conditions and the person at the front desk refused. Good customer service…
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Course was in really good late season condition. Pace, perfect; price very good. Fun course, staff was outstanding."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"I recently golfed the south and north courses with friends from Ohio.The fairways and greens were acceptable, but the condition of the cart paths was disappointing.My guests commented that their course in Ohio, which is an average or lower rated course, is in better condition.Needless to say, it was discouraging to hear their comments since I live on the course."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Two-some played in less than 3 hrs right after lunch. North course in good shape.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Temp 94 when we finished. Course is in good condition.Didn't wait on a shot.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Play PB north all the time, conditions are in great shape - some of the best i've seen the greens! well done, mgmt team"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"The course looks great when you arrive, and the staff is friendly. We played an early morning tee time, but we immediately were followed by several groups of 2 & 3 people, who seemed to be members playing a scramble. They were very disrespectful, including one group who completely skipped hole 2 and passed on to hole 3 to get in front of us. They then played extremely slow (they hadn’t even finished teeing off by the time we got to them), and slowed down our entire pace of play."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"The greens are in god awful shape, especially for the price you pay to play here. Divots everywhere, and there was even an entire chunk taken out on one of the greens that looked like someone hit it with a wedge."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Fairways were in very rough shape as well. The conditions and sportsmanship are what I would expect from a $20 course, not a course that charges $60 a round."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"First time playing. Course was well maintained, challenging but not too challenging. Course staff was attentive and very friendly."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Check in - easyPutting green - convenient, in good shapeStarter (Jim) - very friendly. He had to drive up to us at first green to say cart paths only. Pro shop hadn’t said anything."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Sure enough due to recent rains that had only let up the previous afternoon, the course was pretty wet. Drove through several puddles and small ponds that had accumulated along the way. #9 was probably the wettest hole I’ve ever played."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Nonetheless had 92 with 5 pats (4 on front 9) with birdie on par 3 #14. I fell apart on #18 and took a 9, and blew a par 4 on #17 and took a double bogie. Nonetheless I broke 100 with personal best 92, and had a very enjoyable round with my neighbor and Sam, a recent Purdue grad who joined us."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Golf is a great game. Thanks Pebble Brook.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,I've played this course plenty of times over the last 4 years....not sure what the issue is. The main issues was the greens!! Every green was in really bad condition. From 20-30 ball marks to bare or burned spots that are trying to grow back. Paid $42 via a hot deal.....would be very upset if I paid full price. This will be the last time I play this course this year.....hopefully next year is better.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Weather and course were fine. Disappointed to have to pay for a cart and then not be able to use with cart path only play.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Just enough challenge to keep it interesting but most holes are pretty forgiving if you send it off the fairway a bit, tee boxes were all on good shape, greens were a bit beat up but not because of course management, mostly unrepaired ball marks,"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Really like this course, will play many more times"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,The course was in really good condition. We finished the course in approx 4 hrs. Staff was very friendly. We really enjoyed our round. We will definitely play this course again.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Slow play. Really slow. Also no food or drink available at all. Other than that decent track.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Played the North course. Proshop staff and Starter really friendly and helpful. Nice out and back layout. Fairways and greens in good condition. Sand was some of the best I've played out of in the area. Snack shack at the 9-10 hole was a nice oasis for food and drink in the heat. Recommend the course if you are in the area
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Very good course to play golf on short notice. The staff was very friendly and helpful which made the experience better.I played the north and south courses and the north is in way better shape. Too many weeds and clover on south course so you will definitely have trouble finding your ball off the fairways.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Tee boxes were “under repair” aka sand. Course layout is not the greatest. They only charge so much because of the location, you’re better off spending your money elsewhere. North course had bad tee boxes and the south course was poorly maintained, dry, patches all over greens."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,We played on a busy day but pace was excellent. Course was challenging and pretty good shape. Some tee boxes were very rough but they are obviously working on them.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,The course was in good shape. The pace of play was great. The staff was very friendly. We really enjoyed our round and will be back!
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"There is much to like. Layout, greens & management are all excellent. The only black mark are the atrocious tee boxes. The grass at my gas station is better maintained than this.In any case - this is a great course for the money."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Course was great , staff pleasant , food and amenities perfect . Great time ! Will be back"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Would have given 5 stars if area around the tee boxes and tees themselves were in better condition. They are in there same shape as last year.On a very good note, the fairways and greens were in very good condition."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Pace of play on weekends can be slow at times.However course is in excellent condition and appears they are monitoring tee times and pace of play.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Highly recommended courses
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"The course was in great shape. A few of the tee boxes were beat up, but the fairways and greens were great. My buddy and I played 18 in 3 hours, and really enjoyed the course. Noticed that a couple of bridges have been fixed and have all new wood. Nice to see they continue to put money into upkeep. We will defintely be back."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Considering early March course was in good condition... fairways and greens great... new sand from late last year needs raked and fluffed up... some tees need work as heavy played course and no divot fills leaves them pretty chewed up.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"They scheduled a Halloween party about 45 minutes before my tee time. No notice when I get there. Booked 10 holes ahead and the people refuse to let you go ahead. Called into the shop and they had a terrible attitude, sure I’m not the only one that called. Offered to prorate my refund since I got a couple of holes in."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Terrible experience, decent course minus being super wet, but awful experience on such a fine Sunday."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"A little slow (July 4th weekend that’s to be expected) but the course was in great shape! Only downside is that you can’t hit an approach more than 10 yards off the green or it’s in heather and gone. It’s a little unfair (aka not fun) in that way. Other than that, it’s a good value for $40."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Definitely has its challenges but it’s also just a very good course and design. Had a great time
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,The staff was very friendly and helpful we got there early and they let us go off early the course was in immaculate shape greens were rolled True it was a great time would highly recommend this course to anybody
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Everything was good. The course was in fairly good shape and the pace was good. The cart paths were bellow expectations. The staff was very nice and friendly. I do recommend this golf course. The front nine does not end up at the clubhouse and the halfway house was locked up. Therefore, there was no restrooms available once you started. It would have been nice to know beforehand."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Loved the course however it is easy course for pro golfers.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,The course was in great shape for this time in the year. Pace was good and for the most everyone was very friendly
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Everything was very good. The course was in good shape and the pace was ok. The staff was very nice and friendly. I do recommend this golf course and I will be back to play many more rounds
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,The North course has a lot of character and is in better condition than the South. The main difference is the te boxes which are even with less trouble spotsYou can’t go wrong either way especially due to the fact the staff is kind and inviting
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,The layout of this course makes for a fun round and few lost balls.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Played North Course on 30 Sept, again. Staff is always friendly and professional! Tee boxes are getting a little rough in places but appears to being addressed. The greens have been aerated and sanded.. morning dew does slow the role.. but still fun experience. Highly recommend!"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Been a few years since I have played this track and had a really good time. Greens have been aerated and sanded but were smooth enough. Fairways are in pretty nice shape, and the bunkers were the best I have seen in the last month."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"My father, sister and I have played the north course for the first time in July and enjoyed our experience so much we went back the next time we all played together in September. Both times the course was in good condition and we found it to be a fun layout. We had good interactions with staff and will certain come back in future."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Overall the course was good, but the tee boxes And greens sometimes We’re less than desirable. We are looking for a Westfield-area course as we are relocating to the area.We were paired with two fine young men who were perfect for us."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Tee boxes and greens are not in good shape at all. Not worth 55.00!!!
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Overall the course was good, but when we first arrived to check in at the golf store the woman working the desk was very rude. It was my and my husband’s first time playing (we had only previously done driving ranges) and no one told me when to show up or what all was included in club rentals when I booked it. She yelled at us for only showing up 10 minutes before our tee time and for booking our first play on a Saturday. It was for my husband’s birthday and unfortunately set a very bad tone for the start of our day. When she was gathering items for us she condescendingly asked us if we even knew how to play. She was very insulting and rude. She should not be working the front desk if she is going to treat guests this way. Our first choice will be to attend a different course before returning due to her demeanor."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Starter is usually a bit iffy. But I got there right at 2, and other golfer I was pared with had already teed off. I caught up with him. His wife and 3-month old girl were riding along! Despite the heat we had a really enjoyable outing. The turn at 10 there was a 6-some on the green, a bunch of dudes hanging out. They let us play through on 11 though so all was good. Shot a 102 from the golds."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"After heavy rains it was cart path only so the pace of play was good and the course played a little longer.Good day, Good course & great people."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Course is in great shape, staff is excellent, and great value"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"My first time out at this course and it won’t be the last! I played the north 18, it had a great variety of holes with challenging shots but also allowed for a an occasional misfire without being in too much trouble, greens were fast, which I prefer, fairways in great shape, some of the par three tee boxes were very worn but nothing extreme that inhibited finding a spot to tee off. I felt the value was pretty good for the quality of the course. Looking forward to my next round here!"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"This is the third time I have played this course this season. It has improved substantially. My hat is off to the greenskeeper and his staff. The course is coming along very well and is a real pleasure to play. Enjoyed the round a lot and even though a bit cool, the weather was great. Thanks for all the work you all are doing to make this course and the south course a great experience."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"I always enjoy playing Pebblebrook, but was surprised that the greens and T-boxes were not in good condition. I know it is early in the season, but the greens have a lot of marks on them and in some cases areas of missing grass. The T-boxes were also kind of rough. Work to repair t-boxes is underway, but still a bit disappointing."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"I recently played the south course, and I couldn't wait to come back to try out the north course. Both very enjoyable."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,I played the North course after a substantial rain the day prior. Rough was fine. Bunkers were some of the best sand anywhere. The greens and tee boxes were much to be desired. We had a 4 some and finished right at 3.5 hours which was excellent. Out of position wont penalize a player too bad which is nice for a hacker like me.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Windy day but course is in good condition. Greens fast and true. Our 3some finished in 3 hours. Always fun here.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Greens were very firm ,very fast,and smooth.Fairways were also firm and got extra yardage.The course was beautiful and leaves were no problem.Nobody was behind or in front of us.Weather was awesome !What a day !Thanks Pebble Brook !"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"This North Course is a nice track. It gets a lot of public play which causes some issues for the course. The tee boxes are relatively small especially for the par 3’s. This does not allow for movement of tees so they can repair. It’s like standing on a bombed out battlefield when you are trying to find a even place to tee off. Hopefully, the course will also spend some money on repairing cart paths around the tee boxes and greens. It forces you to drive off the paths damaging the surrounding areas. The course from tee area to greens are well maintained. The greens are what they are. All the pin placements are placed on a slope. Unfortunately, golfers don’t or won’t fix ball marks. All in all a decent trak."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"The course was in pretty good condition, although some of the greens are showing seasonal wear. Of course, the cart paths need work, but that is really a side issue. I played with my brother-in-law and another couple. We had a good round with my brother-in-law scoring his second hole-in-one on #16. I would definitely recommend this course as it offers a good challenge certainly for the money."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Greens were aerated but sanded so all-in-all pretty good shape. Good weather and play moved along well. Done in a little over 3 hours.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"I’ve played here, the past 4 seasons. The past 2 years in the Men’s League. A great group of guys, in a very well run organization. Great amenities, staff, and pro!"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Probably the best value all around.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Two distinctively different courses, both have a wide variety of holes. The greens are outstanding and keep me coming back. Keep it up, Pebblebrook!"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Love playing at Pebble Brook, staff is always friendly and helpful,,, been playing there for 8 years, the north course is getting better every year, keep up the good work.."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"The 19th hole is the best, a very friendly and funny staff,,love the girls, they are great,,,,,"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Very clean . Fantastic staff . Best Carts w/ GPS. Highly recommend
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,really enjoy this course on Sunday with price being very good. My only complaint is the 2 2 - some's playing behind us constantly pushing us. Let 1 go through. Don't like being pushed and course should group 2 some's up!
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"A little worn in places from weather, but overall in good condition. Greens were decent, and rolled pretty true. Trap sand a little heavy, but ok. Good round."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,We’ve had a lot of rain but the course played well.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Be in the fairway. Easy to find yourself in jail otherwise. Greens were a little rough but not too bad. Lots of rain in the spring this year and there were some drainage issues.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Course was still wet from the rains so it was cart path only but the weather was perfect and the course in good shape.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Course needs lot of work this spring. Greens on North course in terrible shape. Several damaged.Cart paths unbelievable.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"If you have 4 hours, go check them out, it's a great track. They have some long holes where you can use your whole bag and they narrow holes, which will challenge your accuracy. So if you have about 4 hours to spend to play some golf, go check them out. #indiana_golf_tips_101 IG"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,I’ve played this course many times and it will always be one of my favorites. It’s always in great condition and the staff are so helpful. It’s one of those courses where you to hit every club in your bag and has something for all skill levels.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Course was in good condition. Played in a little over three hours. One of our favorite courses. Staff in always very friendly!
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Staff is great. We had to stop 3-4 times for showers but still finished in 3 hours. Course in good shape considering the rain in the last week.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,This is a pretty tough course from a he whites for a 15 handicapper
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"I played the north course with a hot deal. Pace of play was great. I played in 3 hours or so. Course is in good shape. Bunker work has been completed. The greens did have some small punch holes in them, but they didn't affect the putts. The greens rolled well. Even with all of the hot weather, the course had been watered well and was responsive. It is a straightforward course that is enjoyable."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Played it a few years ago and the traps on the north course were mainly dirt and rock, but now are sand. Thank you. The course has a good layout, not really tough but fun. The greens play well and not difficult."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,A great day. Course in good condition. Never waited on a shot and the weather was perfect. Played in 2hrs. 45min.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,First spring round was enjoyable at Prebblebrooke- staff was very friendly and course was in excellent shape!
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"North course was excellent the only issue was waiting to start but that was due to frost on the course, totally reasonable. Clubhouse staff were excellent, food was great. Course conditions were fantastic considering it was the day after Thanksgiving, bunkers, greens, and fairways were well maintained. The high grass areas are unforgiving. I look forward to going back during warmer weather"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Finest Greens in the area. Course has recovered beautifully from the hot/dry stretch and is in great shape. They are reconstucting several bunkers which when accomplished will only add to the aesthetics and challenge of this forgotten gem. Golf snobs may thumb their nose at this one but I know better.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Hard to beat the value for the cost. Only issue, many take advantage of the value. The course doesn’t pair people up and no ranger. Very slow pace."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Booked my tee time thru Golfnow using credits. Went to check in and the woman at the check-in said I wasn't in the system. Have had her before and not the most professional person. Got a receipt in case I needed to show the stater. Sure enough it was needed. The course was very wet and probably should have been closed on the north.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"My brother-in-law and I played the North course and find the layout very good and enjoyable. However, the condition of the greens seem to be deteriorating even at this late stage in the season. Lots of people are playing and not fixing their ball marks and the service of the greens were showing signs of such abuse without it being repaired. Otherwise the course was fun to play and offered a good challenge."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Second time I have played this course and really enjoyed it. Greens were fast and in good condition. Sand traps were a mixed bag , most were in good shape and the rest were not due to previous rain. Layout was very good with a mixture of short and long holes as well as tight with trees and some with wide fairways. Looking forward to play it again. Played the white tees and shot 85 . I am not a big hitter 68 yrs old."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Great course for the money. GPS on carts. Bunkers were in good shape (one exception of under repair situation). Pace of play was good until a group of us ran into a five some and a six some of members who were holding things up quite a bit. I joined a six some for one hole and became a seven some. Then 4 left the course after the first nine because it was just too slow with the large groups in front of us. A Ranger should have been on the course to get the members to stand aside or break up.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Course was in pretty good shape considering it is September and it hasn't rained a ton recently. We played the North course which was not overly challenging but did provide blind shots and hazards that can trip you up. Pace of play was excellent.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"I have been playing Pebblebrook for years, it's never been in this good of shape. I will say the greens were lightning fast. But if you're on your game, it's a great track!"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"8 minutes after teeing off on the first hole, the starter approached me and said ""we need you to play in 4 hours or less."" We were all on the green by this point. I explained that we were playing at a good pace, but he argued that we had been on the hole too long. We finished the opening par 4 in 10 minutes with a foursome. That is a solid pace according to anyone. Your employees should be more hospitable, especially to make up for your dirt traps and crab grass infested rough."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Well maintained, you can locate your ball and it increases pace of play. Challenging enough to enjoy your round on either course."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Very friendly staff with good beer prices :-)
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Course was pretty well kept. There were spots where course improvements were being made which was good to see in my opinion. Cart paths are alittle rough but didn't affect our day. Fairways were in great shape. Greens did show signs of a lot of play.. didn't see as many unrepaired ball marks as I usually do, but we played mid afternoon instead of evening. Very enjoyable course."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,I played with another golfer who was a single as I was playing on the spur of the moment. We had a good time and the golf course is in great condition. It had been quite awhile since I played Brookshire. The changes were mainly removing some of the trees on a few holes which made the course more playable. So overall a very enjoyable round of golf.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Course was in excellent condition.Only fault would be the cart path need repairs. They were broken up and very rough on almost every hole.Fun layout. Back nine a little squeezed in.Really good value for the course though. Very nice overall.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"This course was great! I enjoyed the course But....the First Lady I saw wasn't really all that friendly, there were 2 of us golfing and in all time I have golfed never had 2 more people booked with us like yesterday. Something I enjoy about other courses is in between 9 and 10th hole we can stop in for a quick bite to eat, there was a little shack in between the 9and 10th hole here and it was hot out and I was thirsty as heck so when the lady got all our order together....didn't have a credit card reader so we couldn't get anything and had to drive all the way back to the main clubhouse to finally get something to eat...the woman at the shack was very friendly and gave me a cup of ice to get through it but it was a huge inconvenience to have to drive all the way back to the clubhouse so if you plan on coming to this course please make sure you have cash!!!"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"I have always enjoyed playing Pebble Brook. Very nice facility, staff and courses."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Pebble Brook North is a very nice course and a great value. The layout of the course is great and is in great shape. The course was wet which we expected after all the rain we had. Our only complaint was the pace of play. We waited on every shot on every hole. A Marshall would be nice but more importantly golfers understanding what ready golf is would go along way in eliminating these issues. We will be back again
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"My friend and I played this course yesterday and there was standing water pretty much everywhere. While we have had some rain lately, it made me question if they're experiencing drainage issues."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"I played it a couple times last year and it was in great shape. I'll certainly give it another try, but will wait until the weather clears up."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Staff is super friendly, track has a nice layout. Check it out when the weather breaks for the spring!"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Pebble Brook is a nice course with a great staff. Course was in good shape which was challenging given we had recently had some rain. Weather a bit cool but sunny, so nice brisk fall day."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"What stood out was the staff. When I arrived a bit early the staff greeted me. I was a single, but that did not matter, they still worked to give me a great experience. They offered me to change courses (they have 2 18's) to get off earlier and play faster which I took."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"On returning to the clubhouse, they asked about the course, my experience for the day and wanted to make sure I had a good day. They also showed me heavily discounted merchandise that I took advantage and purchased."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,It was nice to see a truly caring staff that added to a great golf experience.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Had a great time! A little stormy when we started, but it cleared up. They are in the process of rebuilding some of the tee boxes, but did not bother us! Course in great shape! Wish other golfers would work at replacing divets and repairing ball marks."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,I love playing Pebble Brook whenever I can. The price is right and the course is just challenging enough for an intermediate golfer.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"I was able to play the first 3 holes, sitting +1 and then on the horizon a fast moving most or at least that's what it looked like. Low and behold, it was a fast moving rain storm chasing everyone to the clubhouse. It was something like a deleted scene from CaddyShack. The golf carts all racing to not get caught by the storm coming in. Needless to say, I had to get a raincheck for this day. But sense this wasn't my first time at this particular course, I am sure I will have a great round upon my return."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Both courses are nice. The front nine of the north course was in great shape par 36. The back nine is a little choppy and only one par 5 and 3 par 3s for a par 34. Great people work there and we played in 3 1/2 hrs. Played with my son so by default a grea day and will return.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Got great weather for mid summer. Work they've done on condition of the course, particularly the bunkers is great and really good green fees."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Always enjoyable playing Pebble Brook. I typically will play it about 7-10 times a year. I like the South Course better than the North Course because of the hole layout on the front 9 but both are in great shape, especially the greens. Money is obviously being put back into the course as many of the bunkers are being rebuilt with new sand everywhere."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Played the north course. Greens were somewhat bumpy and fairways were ok. Nice course for avg. golfer. Better hit it straight. Grill room food was excellent. Great deal on Golfnow. Would play again.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Sand traps are in need of extensive work. No excuse for the poor trap conditions.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"The north course at this facility has been completely ignored this year!!! For the price of a round, I expect to not have fairways that are cratered all over and bunkers that are full of weeds! Not sure I'll be back, there are so many better courses in the area at this price point."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,The person that collects the golfing fees good take a lesson in how to treat the customer.I have had this person before and just seems he is doing you a favor by collecting the fees.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"The course was in decent condition, but several had some pretty rough areas on the fairway. Front counter guy seems to have a chip on his shoulder. Overall a good place to take a few buddies once a month. Good value for riding 18."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Great course with exception of sand traps lacking sand. Greens were in perfect shape, nice mix of length of holes on par fours. Would recommend playing here. Very nice golf staff."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,It was obvious PB is making an effort to get the sand traps in shape. The day I played there was only one trap that was playable. Most were mud or standing water. There was evidence the traps were being worked on. Once the drainage is fixed it will take a lot of new sand. The original sand has mud mixed in. I still enjoy the course. It is a good course for a group with a wide range of handicaps. Low handicappers are challenged by elements which don't punish those shooting the higher numbers.Keep up the good work PB
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"North course tight fairway lies and hard. Poor drainage in sand bunkers and some repair work going on. But, special deal was worth it on Golf Now."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Played this course for the first time and it was worth the money. Beyond it raining possibly 4 inches the day before the course was ok. Bunkers we're under water same with some spots on the fairways. The greens are in great shape. Enjoyed the gps system in the carts. Layout of the course was fun and the day turned out great. I will be back, hoping it doesn't downpour the night before."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Very, Very Disappointed in Pebble Brook North Course. Used to be a good Golf Course. But now it is bad. The only thing that was good was the Greens. They were in good shape. The sand traps had weeds in them and were just dirt on most every hole. The staff had no marshal and people were playing very slow. We waited on every hole and the group in front of us was a 3 some and they were having to wait. I could see this course charging $25, but not $50. They need to spend some money on their Tee Boxes, Fairways and Sand Traps. As well as getting a Marshall to increase pace of play. I don't think I would waste my time and play here every again and I live 15 minutes away."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"The north course was relatively easy. The greens were in good shape. The majority of the bunkers were unplayable due to rain and maintenance. This course can be played quickly. We had to wait a good bit, and still played under 4 hours. It is away from houses and roads. Also, you don't pass the clubhouse at the turn."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Although the bad weather and circumstance of down trees and branches. The employees were hard at work to remove debris and branches to the best of there ability! Appreciate they had carts staying in rough to protect the course and fairways. Had a great day. See you soon. Thanks Scott Bechman.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Course was in good shape considering all the rain we had over the weekend
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Pebble Brooke is a fun course to play with just enough challenges to keep you from having too much fun. Keep the weekly hot deals available and I'll keep playing. Can't wait to see how good the north course looks when the bunkers are done.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Probably the quickest round of plate of golf in probably three years . Course look good probably could have been mowed a little tighter and sand traps were not playable at all. Anytime I can get 18 holes of golf in three hours and 30 minutes is never a bad thing .
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Excellent experience. Two of us played after work, starting at 5:40 and finished 18 in slightly more than 3 hours. Will be back again."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"The course was great and I really enjoyed playing there. The only issue I had was they allowed 4 singles (obviously members with their own golf carts) to play behind us. You could tell they were very familiar with the course and were constantly pushing us on the back nine. We weren't playing slow at all, but felt rushed because the 1st one done would immediately move to the next tee box while the other 3 would finish putting on the previous green. Not fun for the last few holes!"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,The North course looks to be going through some changes. Several bunkers were marked off to be re cut. They had no sand in them. Other than that the pace was quick and the course was fine.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Course was in ok condition but it's early. Good value
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Course was in good shape for early in the season. Place was packed and took us (two-some) 5 hours to play 18!!! (yes, I understand it was first nice Saturday of year, but man, 5 hours for 18..) We played the North Course and a bit disappointed it does NOT go by clubhouse after #9, they did have a mini clubhouse that seemed it has been abandoned for years. Maybe a heads up on that before round starts is good idea for staff to mention."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Very nice for the price, friendly service, beautiful greens"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Haven't played the course in years and the back nine on the south course was better than I remember. Bunkers had little to no sand in them, perhaps my only complaint. Great day."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"This the first time I have played the north course in years. I found the course overall very good and moderately challenging. They had just aerated the greens a couple of days before we played. While there were no plugs, the greens were almost like putting on carpet or even concrete. Very, very fast -- we had rooster trails of sand when the ball went across. They made play very tough. Hopefully, the maintenance work will help the greens become a bit more forgiving and normal."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Most of the course was in good shape. All the bunkers had wash outs and standing water.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,best bargain on the nothside of indy. better than good condition
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Staff was friendly and helpful, course was ok. If i lived nearby it would be a better deal at $24, but not worth driving an hour each direction."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"I took my experienced 11yr old out for a day of golf and I could not have asked for a better time than we had at this course. The staff was great, they saved me money, and the course was very nice. The Junior tees were challenging but realistic so my son had a great day. It was a Monday so we got done in plenty of time with almost no waiting."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Nothing to write home about. A couple of holes were interesting. Play was very slow, we waited on every hole. From a condition standpoint it was a little disappointing. I feel like for $49 I would have rather played Trophy Club or spent a little more and went to Plum Creek or Bear Slide."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,It was difficult to locate the yardage markers plus the flags had no prisms for use of our rangefinders. The staff was very cooperative allowing us to play ahead of an outing group. We played less than 3+ hours. Course is just challenging enough to test one's skills but enjoyable enough that one can score occasionally. Will play again for a nice change from my home course.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"It's a fun course fairly difficult. Almost every hole had some ground under repair which was really the only draw back on condition. Pro shop guy wasn't overtly rude but he clearly did not care about whether or not he came across as friendly and welcoming, which he did not. Perhaps it was because I was using a golf now deal and wasn't a regular."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,I would go back if there's another good deal.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"nothing exciting - fairly flat, easy course. fairways pretty wide; greens rolling well and holding. just an average golf experience."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Very scenic course. Lots of trees. This course is very open in my opinion. allows room for error. Beautiful Layout.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Had a good experience staff is very attentive and friendly. The course is in pretty good shape seem to be doing some work on drainage issues with a few sand traps (they were marked as GUR) so free drop which is always helpful. The greens are fast and true. The pace of play was really good. Overall worth the price and a good day of golf.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Been playing here since 1993. Course in good condition. Bunkers spotty, but not where I want to be anyway. Greens great except for poor mannered golfers and their divots. Fairways in very good shape. Rough not too disastrous. Pace of play excellent. Will return again."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,We like the north course. Course is in good condition. Take advantage if the replay rate in the evening of 10.00.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Its just a nice course. The holes have a nice variety. The condition was good. The greens were a good speed. Some of the fairways are a bit narrow and the roof is a bit too high is the only mark against.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,I've played both the north and south courses several times and always enjoy the course.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Offers 2-18 courses with the South course being more challenging and a turn at the clubhouse. **QUICK TIP: if you play the North course the concession stand isn't open during the week. Has facilities but no place to get food and drinks are limited to the vending machines. The South course is a bit more challenging but the better experience.** The course was somewhat wet due to heavy rain the day before but was not a hindrance. Only minus I could give was no ranger to keep play moving: checked in early for me tee time and their was a a lengthy wait on both courses. Not good to book a tee time and have them stacked up back to back to back especially when one the groups teeing off has 2 that ride and one that walks. Other than that, once play; finally got started it moved at a fairly acceptable rate. Keep in mind I played as a single but it would have been nice if players ahead of me had offered to allow me to play through. All in all I would recommend the course as it is rare to find anyone in the area who offers 36 holes that have 2 separate 18 holes of golf and the course was in good shape in spite of the rain. In terms of star ratings of 1 to 5 I generally give Pebblebrook a 4-4.5 stars rating...not the most difficult courses out there but still challenging, usually a good pace of play, usually course in good shape and a good value for the money. My rating for the food/concession area was based on previous experience since I didn't use it this time."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Great course overall. Only complaint was how bad the cart path was. Definitely needs to be replaced.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Course was in good condition and pace of play was very quick. With the GolfNow discount, was definitely worth it."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,It has been a few years since I played here at an outing. This time the course was pretty wet and it made things difficult. There were no restrictions on carts but we found we got nearly buried in wet soft turf. A fairly high percentage of the traps were full of water and the grass was abnormally long. The weather has been difficult but this course seems to be suffering more than some others I've played recently.Windrows of grass sitting on top of long grass made fairway play mandatory.No clubhouse at the turn a negative. $2 Coke vending machine a bit high.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,It's a relatively easy course in that you can hit the ball all over the map and still manage a decent score. The greens were in great shape and rolled true. Best I've seen them in the many times I've played this course over the years. Overall course conditions were good.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Greens quite fast for this time of year, but true. Overall the course was in pretty good shape after such a hard winter. No debris on the course. Always enjoy playing here."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Considering it was March, this course provided excellent play, even the greens. Sand had not been recently raked, but excepting some rare standing water in one or two, the sand provided mid-season playability by being as soft as it was. I was very surprised at how fair both play out of the sand and putting on the greens were. Hey, it's March, the course has not had much play for months, and we've had a horrendous winter. A nice, though unexpected, surprise."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Pebble Brook has 2 well designed golf courses with different architecture. Both courses have their challenges , with 4 sets of tees for all levels of golf skills. Fairways and green conditions have improved substantially this year - credit to the new management team.Tee times are usually available and time for a round of golf rarely exceeds 3.5 hours. Green fees are very reasonable.Very friendly pro shop staff. Course is easy accessed from most locations in Central Indiana"
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,The coursse was in over all in pretty good shape. the sand bunkers were well maintained.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,Greens were quick. It was in good shape for limited rain. No snack shop or cart on the North Course. Load up before you go out.
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Course is green, greens are decent now, the tee boxes are destroyed. They space the tee markers way to wide and have a lot of outings so they drunk dudes wreck the entire tee box.Instead of narrowing/moving the tees when there is an Outting, they keep them in the middle of the tee box and go totally across ALL of them...You have to play the bunkers as waste bunkers a lot. All dirt and rock hard... If you hit into a bunker, chances are...it'll run/jump out.Lots of flooded sprinkler heads, like a water bed in places."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,"Staff is nice the Pro, Dan is great.Very green, good rough, nice fairwaysI play it often...a south and north course allows up to play quickly..."
Pebble Brook Golf Club - North Course,573-pebble-brook-golf-club-north-course,I recommend it...but there are better maintained courses very close to Pebble Brook for not much more money or often the same price.
Stony Creek Golf Club - The Championship Course,572-stony-creek-golf-club-the-championship-course,"To update my previous reviews, there has been a lot of money and effort put into the course, and it's on the way back. But there still is a ways to go."
Stony Creek Golf Club - The Championship Course,572-stony-creek-golf-club-the-championship-course,"Positives: they are updating the 18th hole to help for drainage hit the bottom, they've added natural areas behind the tees and greens near the creek in the back of the course, tees and fairways.rough in good shape"
Stony Creek Golf Club - The Championship Course,572-stony-creek-golf-club-the-championship-course,"Negatives: greens still have some filling in to do. Not nearly as bad as last year, but several were resodded and it shows. Growth is inconsistent and patchy in spots too, especially on the back 9 holes. 10 green still has a large bare spot. The greens are also very slow since they are letting them grow back in. So putting is still a bit of pinball on most greens. But it's better than last year."
Stony Creek Golf Club - The Championship Course,572-stony-creek-golf-club-the-championship-course,Will be interested to see how the summer helps things fill in.
Stony Creek Golf Club - The Championship Course,572-stony-creek-golf-club-the-championship-course,"As an update to my review from 2 years ago, it pains me to say this but the course (by their own admission) applied the wrong chemicals on the greens and killed them. This happened 2 months ago and they are only getting worse, not better. A couple are shut down completely, but many others have bare spots on about half the green. Every green has damage of some amount, leading to a bumpy, inconsistent experience. Honestly, they'd probably be better off shutting down and resodding, which would be costly but probably better for their long run. Because right now they are not playable, which is sad because the rest of the course is in pretty good shape."
Stony Creek Golf Club - The Championship Course,572-stony-creek-golf-club-the-championship-course,"I enjoy sneaking over here when I can, so it pains me to write this review. But it's the truth. Hopefully next year will be better for them, but they need to do something before the winter for that to happen."
Stony Creek Golf Club - The Championship Course,572-stony-creek-golf-club-the-championship-course,"I played in a few tournaments here as a kid and have since moved away. I was very impressed by the course conditions, true greens, and how picturesque the golf course was! I'll definitely be back soon to play here. It was gorgeous!"
Stony Creek Golf Club - The Championship Course,572-stony-creek-golf-club-the-championship-course,"The course is in decent shape, and the layout is ok - nothing special (though I think the 18th hole needs redesigned). They have several tee boxes so it's good for learning the game as well."
Stony Creek Golf Club - The Championship Course,572-stony-creek-golf-club-the-championship-course,"Biggest complaint is the pace of play. I've played 18 in 2 hours there. I've also been trapped after they let groups go off the back for no reason, which really turns me off about playing the course again."
Stony Creek Golf Club - The Championship Course,572-stony-creek-golf-club-the-championship-course,"I play mostly in afternoons, and there is really no one to force the pace of play. Rounds can exceed 4.5-5 hours, and the etiquette isn't always there to let you through. Course, staff, and range are great though."
Forest Park Golf Course,5899-forest-park-golf-course,"Forest Park is your typical classic course form the 1920s - lots of mature trees and small greens. Only 9 holes, and you tee off from a mat on 1, which is a short, reachable par 5 (the only one). Hole 4 has 2 greens for some reason, and holes 5 & 6 run along route 19, and while there are large trees between the course and the road a stray shot can get out there."
Forest Park Golf Course,5899-forest-park-golf-course,"I was literally the only person on the course on this hot afternoon, so it took me 1:19 to ride 18 holes. Not bad for $20, which is their weekday riding special. The course overall is in good shape, greens are a little slow but roll true, fairways are fine, and the rough is like a backyard but not long. Has some room to miss off most tees and greens, though a couple greens have tiny bunkers guarding them. All in all, it'd be a great place to learn the game and has a good rate. If you can get out there when it's empty you'll get around quick too. Won't knock your socks off but you can do worse."
Forest Park Golf Course,5899-forest-park-golf-course,"got it as hot deal for $6 course is in great shape, not overly difficult but fun to play. Staff super friendly. Definitely worth the money"
Forest Park Golf Course,5899-forest-park-golf-course,This is the second course I've played in my life. It should have been the first course for a beginner. This course is better fit for someone new to golf. The 9 hole is a lot of fun for anyone.
Forest Park Golf Course,5899-forest-park-golf-course,"This course is very good to come out and play with a few friends. You do not have to be a really good player to play well, even though at this golf course beginners play it is a great place to play because the pace of play is very quick and the course is not that challenging but still fun and a good price."

Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Haven't reviewed this course in a couple years so I figured I'd provide an update.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Start in the pro shop where the attitude of ""good enough for government work"" is on full display - the people checking you in act like it's a complete burden for them to do so and have quite an attitude. How dare I want to play golf? Carts are ok, but have no windshield."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Course itself is in its usual shape - patchy here and there and some greens on the East 9 had water damage spots but overall not bad. Sand traps are very inconsistent, like they dumped it all in the traps closest to the clubhouse and forgot about the rest. Several are as much dirt/mud as they are sand, then some are thicker than an elementary school sandbox."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Clientele trends to the older side, and they play at there pace and do not care if you're behind them. Skip holes if you need to when stuck behind these guys that act like they own the place., it's fairly easy to do so given the layout, especially on the East 9. Don't expect to see a ranger. Also don't expect those guys to fix a ball mark. The greens were recently punched as well, adding to the fun on the greens, which were at a decent pace today."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"All in all you can do worse, but there is better around. The Monday $29 special is a decent rate. But don't go out of your way to do it."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,We enjoyed playing this very nice looking course! We look forward to playing again sometime!
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"I haven't played this course in a long time, it played fast and is very nice, I'd recommend this course, we had a great time. Thanks"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,I always enjoy this course. It had been a little dry but everything was still in good condition.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"The course was in good shape despite the lack of rain for the past month. My wife and I were a twosome, and pace of play was good."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Loved the challenging layout and excellent course condition- definetly will be playing this course again.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,It had quit raining when I arrived and the course wasn't busy. I teamed up with three guys who played the course often and we had a great round(Not the score).
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"27 holes in all seems to keep pace of play steady, even on a gorgeous Saturday afternoon. The East 9 is the most challenging with elevation changes and blind shots that are not common in central Indiana. Greens were in good shape, as were most of the bunkers. Not terribly long, but a tight layout keeps it challenging."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Pro Shop staff very efficient & friendly and helpful....Course in fine shape and greens roll true.....
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Will definitely return this summer
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Nice layout，some long Par 4 and great challenge - highly recommended.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Greens were extremely quick but rolled smooth. Excellent value and course condition for price. Will definitely be back.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Being my local muni, I've played the 3 courses here several times now. West is the easiest and most mundane of the 3. Central is a solid 9, with a couple tight holes, and a couple open holes making for a nice mix. East has a few holes that need to be destroyed, starting with the huge tree on 8 in the middle of the fairway. I have yet to figure out the best way to play that hole. The first hole on that side is tough too, as is the long 2nd with a narrow green with a lot of break."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"The course is in good shape after all the rain recently. Greens rolled quick even late in the day. Sand, predictably after the deluge, could use an overhaul. Everything else was in good shape. It's not a course you'll rave about, but you can do a lot worse than here, especially when it's not busy and you can cruise around."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,The course is in the best shape of any course in town. The Best Buy for the buck.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Course was in fantastic shape for fall. Greens rolled very nice. There were some branches that had fallen off the trees due to high wind the day before on some of the tee boxes that were kind of annoying, but can't really complain about that."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,It was cold and the leaves were so deep it was easy to lose balls. I spent way too much time looking for my ball as I didn't always hit the fairway and it had a lot of leaves. t is a fun course and I will play it again when they rake the leaves.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,This was a beautiful course. It was challenging but I am a beginner golfer.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,I played the center and east courses. The East course was beautiful and had excellent terrain. I ended up taking longer than I probably should have taking in the fall colors.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"We arrived to the course around 2:20 and teed off around 2:35. We played a normal round, albeit a little slow because we let a few twosomes pass up so we didn't hold up traffic. At 6:30, we teed off on 18, and a woman from the pro shop came out and yelled at us to bring the carts in. We asked her if we could finish, and she yelled at us more and accused us of playing extra holes. We explained we didn't play extra holes, we had only been out there for about 4 hours (including a 30 minute break to eat after 9) and that we had let people pass through and were not informed of any pace of play rules. She said she didn't care and that we had played extra holes and blocked us from continuing to play. We took the carts in, without finishing, and noticed that she was already in her car ready to leave. It leaves a horrible taste in your mouth when you get kicked off a course so the woman working can leave before we can finish, even though we paid for a full 18. We will definitely be taking our business elsewhere, and advising our friends to do the same."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Good mix of water, sand and trees. Has somesurprises. A straight hitter can do well on thiscourse, but if you scatter your shots, you willbe in trouble early and often."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Fun to play and challenging. Good price for thiscourse.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,First time to play Fox Prairie and we were pleasantly surprised. The course was not flat and boring as we anticipated and as some Indiana courses are. It was in excellent condition. We enjoyed our day!
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Nice course for $30-40 range on the weekends (typical golfnow deal for this course).

Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,All the folks were friendly at this course. It is well-maintained and a joy to play.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Each of the three 9 hole layouts have their own unique challenges. Up and downs streams and lakes and bunkers protecting the greens. The greens, tee boxes and the fairways were all great to play on. The speed of play was good the day I played. As a single it took me seven holes to catch up with a threesome and they were gracious enough to allow me to play through. Good day and a great course made for an excellent day."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,First nine holes pace of play very slow due to slow play of foursome in front of us. Never saw a ranger or staff member out checking on course play.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Passed the slow foursome at the turn and the back nine played in under two hours.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Course is in great shape, greens are fast and must be read correctly. Had a great time playing the round."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Course has some forgiving holes and some you really have to play good to score goid
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"It's hard not to give this facility 5 stars. I have played here twice in the past few weeks and my rounds here are anywhere from good to great, depending on how firm and true the greens are rolling.This is a ""golfers golf course"".... You will use all your clubs, play a variety of holes and shots, etc. The worst condition I have played it in was ""Good"" and sometimes it is Excellent. The head pro is a PRO and runs things extremely well.The selfish side of this would be ignore all my accolades of the course as I really enjoy the great pace of play here! :-) This is definitely 1 of the best values in town and offers plenty of resistance to scoring, depending on the tee you elect to play.Kudos to Fox staff"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Course in good shape. Makes you use a variety of clubs.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Very good value for the Golf Now price. Mid-afternoon tee time during the week and only took 3 hours to play 18.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,I found a great deal for about 20 bucks to play this course. This is one that I don't play that often and it's probably been a few years that has played it. But I was pleasantly surprised with the condition of the greens and the fairways. Layout was ok. Some cool holes. Nothing spectacular. But greens rolled very true the day in played.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Not very busy because of weather. Good for me. 18 in 2 hours. Between par and bogey golf and great practice in the wind conditions. Greens were true after the tree droppings were moved out of the way..
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Its a little long for older players.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Friendly folks at pro shop/snack bar but I had higher expectations for the course. Blind shots were ok but greens weren't overly challenging and bunkers were washed out completely. No GPS on carts or knowledge published on hole placements (could have missed posting). Tee boxes tore up and annoyed with foot soccer course on west. Understand need for revenue from foot soccer but I'm a purist. Overall not bad but for the price but I'll stick to pebble brook or sahms
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,We played the Central and East . . . Over all the course was ok. . . The greens was okay a little slow . . . Me and my son just got back from Myrtle Beach so you know the greens will slow but for this time of year the course was in pretty good shape. . . Going to be nice to play this summer though overall I give it about a three-and-a-half to four stars . . Very good for the value . . . Played the West course so we played 27 holes and the west course was what we played last . . . Played real good went Two over on that side . . . Overall nice place to play golf . . . West side is for foot golf so beware if you play the west side you'll be waiting on them to kick a soccer ball in a hole and in your rough. . . Kinda Different? ? ? ? ?
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,This course is close to our home and is always fun to play. I was surprised what good condition the course was in this early in the season. A lot of down trees however. I prefer the Central and East side.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Great course for the money. I would play it anytime.Fun to play and challenging.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Nice golf course well maintained a few challenging holes.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"This course is one of the best kept courses in the Indy area. Very plush. I played as a single riding and tee it up about 10am. I buzzed around for about 12 holes and then I think I must have caught up with the mens club or something. Lots of senior foursomes walking on every hole. Playing thru would not have helped, so I quit. I would suggest if you play as a single riding, you may want to wait a little later to start. Love this course."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"This is a great municipal course north of Indy. The course is in great shape. It is fair, yet challenging."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"A very good golf course with many tree lined holes. The course was in excellent shape. The greens are very large , held well hit shots and putts rolled very true. I enjoyed the course and will play again soon."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Course was in good condition. The course was very busy, but pace of play was very good. Not until the last few holes did we have to wait between shots. Course was in good condition and staff was very friendly. Would definitely play this course again."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Played 18 holes in a little over 3 hours. Lots of fun.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Played course on my 71st birthday. Weather was perfect and the course was in great shape. Gorgeous, mature course, especially the middle and east nines."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Will play again as soon as possible.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Small town feel with large greens and wide fairways
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Highly recommended. Great condition of fairways and greens. Will play again.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Course was in decent shape though I didn't like a few holes on the East side. Such as the one with a giant tree in the middle of the fairway. But it was in decent shape except for the traps after all the poor weather earlier in the summer. The greens were a bit rock hard and not very receptive. Overall, It's worth a go, especially at the hot deal rate."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Staff was great! Course was in great shape! Played on Friday afternoon and course was nearly empty until later. No problem with pace.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Nice course, has 3 nines and mingles between narrow tree lined fairways to some areas that are pretty wide open. Greens were in great shape and rolled well, and they are very big greens."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Would like to see GPS in the carts as some greens were 30yds deep and going off sprinkler heads is a bit tough.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Extra care is required where to place your drive on dogleg fairways.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"As a duffer, I found this course to be challenging. Played from the white tees and found the distance to be a little long. Course was well maintained although some small areas were under repair. Facilities good and staff friendly. I prefer more distance stakes to judge my shots but most courses seem to be removing them since many use GPS or range finders."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Because of raining was not busy. We were able to get off early and enjoyed a fast playing round! Golf pro was nice and accommodating.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Course was in good condition this early in the season.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"very traditional course with some very long par 3's. Course was in great shape, both fairways and greens. Great value at this time of the year"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,This is a great course for the average golfer. The central and east nine are long but you can't get into much trouble from hazards.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Decent layout with a few scenic holes. Wooded layout with some tight driving holes. Creeks meandering through East & Central 9's affect some shots. First 2 hole on East are looong par 4's (451 & 444 from the WHITES!). Drive on East #8 is like threading a needle between huge tree in right fairway and woods/creek on left (which cuts into fairway more than you can see from tee).Course condition was just OK after recent heavy rains. Work was being done to improve (like new cart paths & renovation of some traps).
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"We played after heavy rains in the area so the ground was somewhat soft, but otherwise it was in great shape. The greens were like smooth carpet balls rolled true. The tees were manicured nicely. We got a great deal on Golf-now and that is what brought us here, but we will come back even without a great deal."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Course was in pretty good condition. A little wet in areas which was surprising considering there hadn't been much rain recently. This was my first time playing the course so I'm not sure if that's normal or if the course has some drainage problems. The biggest CON for me is the lack of yardage markers. I rely heavily on yardages and they are hard to come by on this course! I'd like to see more yardage markers, on sprinkler heads or in a yardage book. For the price of the course they could almost add gps to the carts...that would be a great addition."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,But the course was fun and challenging tee to green and I would play it again.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Tees, and fairways were in great shape. Greens were as fast as any I have played on this year. Sand traps needed a lot of attention as we had to play ""rake and place. You do have to use clubs other than driver off the tee but is that so bad? You see the players who make a living at this doing the same thing."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Had a great time. Brought three of my friends out to play Fox prairie for some golf and time to catch up with each other. Course was challenging but fair. We all really enjoyed the country scenery and agreed we will definitely be back. Didnt like the fact that GolfNow charges you full amount online through them now. Liked it better when you booked online with GolfNow they held your tee time and your foursome could settle up with course individually.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Shot my first round under par at this course so I found it short and easier than the normal courses I play. Course is in great shape! The greens rolled great late in the day! Course was busy but had no trouble playing in less than 4 hours.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Greens are massive and roll nicely. Several long par-4's from whoite tees, pretty fair challenge and interesting course."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"We played the Central/West 18 and were very pleased with the course. The greens are large, smooth, and have a decent pace too them. They are overly fast, but will the subtle breaks they are fast enough to be tricky. We found that some of the distance markings to the creeks seemed to be off, but that would be our only complaint about the course. Our tee time for a twosome was at 10:27 and we were finished around 1:30, so the pace of play was superb. Overall it was a great experience and we will be back for sure!"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"The architect accomplished a minor miracle incorporating a small creek to pose interest on many holes. Made me think! Greens are outstanding. Watering stations are needed on more holes & ladies would appreciate more course-side toilets. Pre-made sandwich was adequate from a cooler, and the attendant was very friendly. Overall facility was neat & clean. A model muni!"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,This was my first time playing this course and so it was an adventure not knowing what lied ahead. I was pleased with the design and degree of difficulty with some of the holes. Right off we were behind a 4 some who took 15 minutes to play the 1st hole but by the 3rd they let us play thru and never had another wait.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Course offers a great setting. Large, challenging greens. Fox Prairie has 3 nine-hole courses."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Booked tee times online , this was in the early afternoon during the week. The course wasn't busy , it's a city owned public course. when we arrived we find out the PRo has decided to pair us up with 2 other players, even thought the course was almost empty.The pro very not friendly or helpful , he kind of acted like I should know where the carts were located , where the 1st tee was , did i mention this is a 27 hole course and he had assigned us to the tees, and that we would be paired up with other players.This has only happened to me 2 other times on courses that were very busy during the moring hours, never during the week"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Have played course since 1993. It is still a good course with many challenging holes. Kept in very good condition.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,This is the best condition I've seen this course in. Green were in very good shape.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,The course was in excellent shape and the greens were putting fast. The cups hadn't been changed so there was weekend wear around all the holes. Would highly recomend this course to anyone.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,The course was in pretty bad condition when I played. The staff was decently friendly but we had a group behind us that were a bunch of old men and they were dicks. I would assume they are members there too. The pace of play was pretty good. I think their prices are outrageous for the course conditions but I was able to play for 19 dollars and I thought that was not bad.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,They keep this course in tip top shape. Great value for the money.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Overall good value for the $36 rate we played. Would play again.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Great day course very well kept. Greens were slow starting out but as the day progressed the greens firmed up. Well kept course and a great value.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Great course and very friendly staff. Thursday is the senior league day. I would not recommend playing on this day as all of the seniors I have encountered have very poor golf etiquette ie make it very clear they will not allow you to play through.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"We played Central to West in 3 hours, The course was in great shape. The greens were firm and consistent. For a City course it is a great value."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,This is a challenging course. The East 9's first 3 holes can put a hefty dent in your scorecard. Played the Central and East this day. Early in the year golf in Indiana = wet.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Course condition would have been pristine if not for the recent airation, greens are healling well though. With the wind against us, 1 and 2 on the East course are two of the toughest back to back par fours I've played this year."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,heck of a deal for 25$ course is in great shape. greens were perfect

Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,I enjoy playing here. Although the greens had been recently aerated they were in good shape. My two playing partners had not played here and they liked the course.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Tough off the tee; kept the driver bagged and hit three wood all day. Great course for the money.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Fox prarie is a nice layout and a good value for the money.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"You can never go wrong by playing Fox Prairie. Ever visit of mine presented a well maintained course. The regular players take care of their course, too. That's not seen on every public course."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Good value and I like the fact that there are 27 holes here. My husband kept saying how pretty some of the views from the tee boxes are. It's challenging, especially with many sand traps bordering greens and trees on many holes. My group and I had fun, however, there were some fairways that needed attention and the rough seemed incredibly dry and hard. Also, the greens didn't seem consistent, some were very fast and super hard where your ball just wouldn't stick, and some were slow, which made attempting to read greens very hard. Overall, a pretty nice track if you want an affordable round. Seemed pretty long for the ladies. GPS would be helpful but luckily you can download an app for that on any android phone. Much better than expected for a municipal course!"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,The course was in pretty good shape. The greens were flat out immaculate. First time playing this course as I wasn't familiar with it until I took a chance and booked it. Very surprised and will definitely play here more.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"We played the Central & East courses. Great combination of challenge and playability. Golf course was in excellent condition. Not sure why I haven't played here more often, but this will definitely become a multiple stop in the rotation. Great value."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Fantastic course to play at. We got a huge deal with playing this course through GolfNow. The course was well maintained, but there was some rough areas that were tapped off along the fairways. There are 3 nine hole courses, Central, East, and West. I recommend Central then East because this was the original course when this club was built. Still, I cannot wait to return to play West next. The greens were the best I've seen on a course this year. All in all, great place to play and Fox Prairie always keeps their course in great playing condition."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,I have played this course every week and it still is in great shape
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Played on the afternoon of August 1, 2013. Course was in good condition, dry, fast fairways and greens that were in good conditions and were quick. Course is parkland style with trees on or near fairways. Very playable course for all levels of players. Played in less than 4 hours. 3 of the par 3's played about the same distance,175 yards, which is somewhat annoying, but other than that I would recommend playing."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"We played Fox Prairie Central and East courses. There are several narrow driving holes and some difficult tree placement to deal with. The course is in great shape and the greens are some of the best in central Indiana. There are also several streams that run down the sides and across fairways, giving you some decisions to make off the tee. Great course for the price, highly recommend."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,It was a beautiful day and the course was good we played the central and east course.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Overall, a great value for the money. I paid $18 and change (with tax). Impressed at the condition for a city course."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"the only thing i'm not happy about is that they never let you play the west course. i really enjoy that 9 holes. other than that, the fairways are in good condition. the greens run well. people do not fix there divot holes. i was constantly fixing them on every green...."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Have played the course many times, in fact, used to be a member. Played Central West and had a great time. Excellent condition, greens were in great shape, if you can't putt these, you can't putt, period."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"This was my first time to play this course, having been told by friends that it was worth playing. I was not disappointed, and will certainly play it again. Course has several loooong par 4 holes for the average golfer, making it a great challenge. Greens were in great condition, and a bit faster than most around the area. Again, making it a good challenge."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"I normally break 100 at most courses, 90 on a good day and this course was a great challenge for me(shot 97). Had the perfect amount of trees/bunkers/doglegs and there were holes I played terribly but there was also a hole I birdied and another two I had birdie putts. Normally courses like this aren't kept very well but this was was in great shape. The greens were the best kept I've seen in indy all year."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,This course has a nice layout and great price for what you get
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Nice older course with lots of character. Enjoyed the East course much more than Central.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"Always base course conditions on the greens, and these were fantastic. Approach shots are difficult because they are firm, but they are extremely smooth surfaces, some of the best I've played on"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,This is only the second time I have played this course and it was in great shape. The holes are all different and they had some drivable par 4's (which I like).
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Central course was the most challenging with trees lining most fairways and multiple dog legs throughout course.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Course was in good shape. Would play again for the right price.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Ended up playing 36 and the replay rate was only the cost of a cart.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Great deal for the frugal golfer.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"The course was well manicured and reasonably well marked. Cart paths and bridges could use some work, but overall a course that we will play again."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"This course makes you hit every club in your bag. It offers a great testNo matter your skill level. From the tips, it offers a challenge ,whatever your handicap.It has some of the largest greens in the area, so you will have several ,opportunities to practice your 40+ feet lag putting."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,I found this course to be a really good deal for the money. It was not an especially unique or beautiful course but it was certainly very well maintained. Found for a great price. I just wish the pace of play was a little quicker. Got stuck behind a foursome of older gentlemen and had to wait on the tee and 2nd shot every time until the turn when they finally let us pass. I would say worth it to go play.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,The course Central/East was in good condition. The wind was blowing 20+ miles per hour with gusts of wind blowing any bad shot the wrong way. The course is very fair and enjoyable.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,"The fairways and greens are in very good condition. I would play there again if there was a good price on golfnow. I would not want to pay the full price green fees. Overall, it was a good course and a good experience."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,This is a beautiful course that is a bit confusing because it is 3 nine hole courses put together. so it is just difficult to figure out where to go next.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/East Course,24905-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-east-course,Nice course at a good price.  Greens are in great shape.
Cypress Run Golf Course,5751-cypress-run-golf-course,Perfect for this early in the season! Couldn't have askedfor better conditions!!!
Cypress Run Golf Course,5751-cypress-run-golf-course,"Staff upset we used golf now, told is not to do it again!!!"
Cypress Run Golf Course,5751-cypress-run-golf-course,It was in rough shape. The deck to the office was badly deteriorating.
Cypress Run Golf Course,5751-cypress-run-golf-course,"Took a couple buddies to Cypress Run, I hadn't been for years but it was well maintained with a good mix of challenging holes. We will be back!"
Cypress Run Golf Course,5751-cypress-run-golf-course,The couse was well maintained. Greens and fairways in good shape. The course is very short only 1 hole over 400 yards and 3 par 3's with 1 of them being only 85 yards very short couse.
Cypress Run Golf Course,5751-cypress-run-golf-course,For a nine hole course it has its challenging holes!
Cypress Run Golf Course,5751-cypress-run-golf-course,"This course is great for me. It minutes away from my house and it greatly differs from my other favorite par 3 course, The Dye Course at The Legends. The coolest thing is that this course mixes it up nicely with par 3, 4, and 5 holes. However, it is only a 9 hole course; which I don't have a problem with, but if you're playing 18 - you'll just have to play the 9 twice. The staff is super friendly and very helpful. They also change the tee placement and hole placement frequently enough to keep things new and interesting. I'll keep going out here for a while."
Cypress Run Golf Course,5751-cypress-run-golf-course,Great especially for couples and ladies. Nice crowd for a Sunday.
Cypress Run Golf Course,5751-cypress-run-golf-course,This is a nice course for the money. I would recommend it to a friend.
Cypress Run Golf Course,5751-cypress-run-golf-course,"The course was in a lot better shape than previous trips, especially the greens. The greens were very quick, but true.It is a great course to take someone who is ready to their game from the practice range to the course. Obviously there is still one par 3 that is to short and a par 5 that is well under 500 yd. that need to be addressed, but there is also a patch of land that is not in use that looks like it could be turned into a long par 4 or a par 5.Overall a great course to take me teenager who is just starting to love the game!! A good 9 hole course that you can usually go right into your second 9 without much problem."
Cypress Run Golf Course,5751-cypress-run-golf-course,Me and my three sons played the nine hole course. The staff was exceptional and the course was decently maintained and was perfect for beginner folders and yet had some difficulty for the more experienced player as well! We had a great time!
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Haven't reviewed this course in a couple years so I figured I'd provide an update.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Start in the pro shop where the attitude of ""good enough for government work"" is on full display - the people checking you in act like it's a complete burden for them to do so and have quite an attitude. How dare I want to play golf? Carts are ok, but have no windshield."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Course itself is in its usual shape - patchy here and there and some greens on the East 9 had water damage spots but overall not bad. Sand traps are very inconsistent, like they dumped it all in the traps closest to the clubhouse and forgot about the rest. Several are as much dirt/mud as they are sand, then some are thicker than an elementary school sandbox."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Clientele trends to the older side, and they play at there pace and do not care if you're behind them. Skip holes if you need to when stuck behind these guys that act like they own the place., it's fairly easy to do so given the layout, especially on the East 9. Don't expect to see a ranger. Also don't expect those guys to fix a ball mark. The greens were recently punched as well, adding to the fun on the greens, which were at a decent pace today."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"All in all you can do worse, but there is better around. The Monday $29 special is a decent rate. But don't go out of your way to do it."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,We enjoyed playing this very nice looking course! We look forward to playing again sometime!
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"I haven't played this course in a long time, it played fast and is very nice, I'd recommend this course, we had a great time. Thanks"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,I always enjoy this course. It had been a little dry but everything was still in good condition.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"The course was in good shape despite the lack of rain for the past month. My wife and I were a twosome, and pace of play was good."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Loved the challenging layout and excellent course condition- definetly will be playing this course again.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,It had quit raining when I arrived and the course wasn't busy. I teamed up with three guys who played the course often and we had a great round(Not the score).
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"27 holes in all seems to keep pace of play steady, even on a gorgeous Saturday afternoon. The East 9 is the most challenging with elevation changes and blind shots that are not common in central Indiana. Greens were in good shape, as were most of the bunkers. Not terribly long, but a tight layout keeps it challenging."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Pro Shop staff very efficient & friendly and helpful....Course in fine shape and greens roll true.....
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Will definitely return this summer
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Nice layout，some long Par 4 and great challenge - highly recommended.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Greens were extremely quick but rolled smooth. Excellent value and course condition for price. Will definitely be back.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Being my local muni, I've played the 3 courses here several times now. West is the easiest and most mundane of the 3. Central is a solid 9, with a couple tight holes, and a couple open holes making for a nice mix. East has a few holes that need to be destroyed, starting with the huge tree on 8 in the middle of the fairway. I have yet to figure out the best way to play that hole. The first hole on that side is tough too, as is the long 2nd with a narrow green with a lot of break."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"The course is in good shape after all the rain recently. Greens rolled quick even late in the day. Sand, predictably after the deluge, could use an overhaul. Everything else was in good shape. It's not a course you'll rave about, but you can do a lot worse than here, especially when it's not busy and you can cruise around."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,The course is in the best shape of any course in town. The Best Buy for the buck.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Course was in fantastic shape for fall. Greens rolled very nice. There were some branches that had fallen off the trees due to high wind the day before on some of the tee boxes that were kind of annoying, but can't really complain about that."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,It was cold and the leaves were so deep it was easy to lose balls. I spent way too much time looking for my ball as I didn't always hit the fairway and it had a lot of leaves. t is a fun course and I will play it again when they rake the leaves.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,This was a beautiful course. It was challenging but I am a beginner golfer.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,I played the center and east courses. The East course was beautiful and had excellent terrain. I ended up taking longer than I probably should have taking in the fall colors.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"We arrived to the course around 2:20 and teed off around 2:35. We played a normal round, albeit a little slow because we let a few twosomes pass up so we didn't hold up traffic. At 6:30, we teed off on 18, and a woman from the pro shop came out and yelled at us to bring the carts in. We asked her if we could finish, and she yelled at us more and accused us of playing extra holes. We explained we didn't play extra holes, we had only been out there for about 4 hours (including a 30 minute break to eat after 9) and that we had let people pass through and were not informed of any pace of play rules. She said she didn't care and that we had played extra holes and blocked us from continuing to play. We took the carts in, without finishing, and noticed that she was already in her car ready to leave. It leaves a horrible taste in your mouth when you get kicked off a course so the woman working can leave before we can finish, even though we paid for a full 18. We will definitely be taking our business elsewhere, and advising our friends to do the same."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Good mix of water, sand and trees. Has somesurprises. A straight hitter can do well on thiscourse, but if you scatter your shots, you willbe in trouble early and often."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Fun to play and challenging. Good price for thiscourse.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,First time to play Fox Prairie and we were pleasantly surprised. The course was not flat and boring as we anticipated and as some Indiana courses are. It was in excellent condition. We enjoyed our day!
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Nice course for $30-40 range on the weekends (typical golfnow deal for this course).

Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,All the folks were friendly at this course. It is well-maintained and a joy to play.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Each of the three 9 hole layouts have their own unique challenges. Up and downs streams and lakes and bunkers protecting the greens. The greens, tee boxes and the fairways were all great to play on. The speed of play was good the day I played. As a single it took me seven holes to catch up with a threesome and they were gracious enough to allow me to play through. Good day and a great course made for an excellent day."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,First nine holes pace of play very slow due to slow play of foursome in front of us. Never saw a ranger or staff member out checking on course play.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Passed the slow foursome at the turn and the back nine played in under two hours.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Course is in great shape, greens are fast and must be read correctly. Had a great time playing the round."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Course has some forgiving holes and some you really have to play good to score goid
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"It's hard not to give this facility 5 stars. I have played here twice in the past few weeks and my rounds here are anywhere from good to great, depending on how firm and true the greens are rolling.This is a ""golfers golf course"".... You will use all your clubs, play a variety of holes and shots, etc. The worst condition I have played it in was ""Good"" and sometimes it is Excellent. The head pro is a PRO and runs things extremely well.The selfish side of this would be ignore all my accolades of the course as I really enjoy the great pace of play here! :-) This is definitely 1 of the best values in town and offers plenty of resistance to scoring, depending on the tee you elect to play.Kudos to Fox staff"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Course in good shape. Makes you use a variety of clubs.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Very good value for the Golf Now price. Mid-afternoon tee time during the week and only took 3 hours to play 18.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,I found a great deal for about 20 bucks to play this course. This is one that I don't play that often and it's probably been a few years that has played it. But I was pleasantly surprised with the condition of the greens and the fairways. Layout was ok. Some cool holes. Nothing spectacular. But greens rolled very true the day in played.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Not very busy because of weather. Good for me. 18 in 2 hours. Between par and bogey golf and great practice in the wind conditions. Greens were true after the tree droppings were moved out of the way..
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Its a little long for older players.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Friendly folks at pro shop/snack bar but I had higher expectations for the course. Blind shots were ok but greens weren't overly challenging and bunkers were washed out completely. No GPS on carts or knowledge published on hole placements (could have missed posting). Tee boxes tore up and annoyed with foot soccer course on west. Understand need for revenue from foot soccer but I'm a purist. Overall not bad but for the price but I'll stick to pebble brook or sahms
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,We played the Central and East . . . Over all the course was ok. . . The greens was okay a little slow . . . Me and my son just got back from Myrtle Beach so you know the greens will slow but for this time of year the course was in pretty good shape. . . Going to be nice to play this summer though overall I give it about a three-and-a-half to four stars . . Very good for the value . . . Played the West course so we played 27 holes and the west course was what we played last . . . Played real good went Two over on that side . . . Overall nice place to play golf . . . West side is for foot golf so beware if you play the west side you'll be waiting on them to kick a soccer ball in a hole and in your rough. . . Kinda Different? ? ? ? ?
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,This course is close to our home and is always fun to play. I was surprised what good condition the course was in this early in the season. A lot of down trees however. I prefer the Central and East side.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Great course for the money. I would play it anytime.Fun to play and challenging.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Nice golf course well maintained a few challenging holes.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"This course is one of the best kept courses in the Indy area. Very plush. I played as a single riding and tee it up about 10am. I buzzed around for about 12 holes and then I think I must have caught up with the mens club or something. Lots of senior foursomes walking on every hole. Playing thru would not have helped, so I quit. I would suggest if you play as a single riding, you may want to wait a little later to start. Love this course."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"This is a great municipal course north of Indy. The course is in great shape. It is fair, yet challenging."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"A very good golf course with many tree lined holes. The course was in excellent shape. The greens are very large , held well hit shots and putts rolled very true. I enjoyed the course and will play again soon."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Course was in good condition. The course was very busy, but pace of play was very good. Not until the last few holes did we have to wait between shots. Course was in good condition and staff was very friendly. Would definitely play this course again."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Played 18 holes in a little over 3 hours. Lots of fun.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Played course on my 71st birthday. Weather was perfect and the course was in great shape. Gorgeous, mature course, especially the middle and east nines."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Will play again as soon as possible.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Small town feel with large greens and wide fairways
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Highly recommended. Great condition of fairways and greens. Will play again.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Course was in decent shape though I didn't like a few holes on the East side. Such as the one with a giant tree in the middle of the fairway. But it was in decent shape except for the traps after all the poor weather earlier in the summer. The greens were a bit rock hard and not very receptive. Overall, It's worth a go, especially at the hot deal rate."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Staff was great! Course was in great shape! Played on Friday afternoon and course was nearly empty until later. No problem with pace.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Nice course, has 3 nines and mingles between narrow tree lined fairways to some areas that are pretty wide open. Greens were in great shape and rolled well, and they are very big greens."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Would like to see GPS in the carts as some greens were 30yds deep and going off sprinkler heads is a bit tough.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Extra care is required where to place your drive on dogleg fairways.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"As a duffer, I found this course to be challenging. Played from the white tees and found the distance to be a little long. Course was well maintained although some small areas were under repair. Facilities good and staff friendly. I prefer more distance stakes to judge my shots but most courses seem to be removing them since many use GPS or range finders."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Because of raining was not busy. We were able to get off early and enjoyed a fast playing round! Golf pro was nice and accommodating.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Course was in good condition this early in the season.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"very traditional course with some very long par 3's. Course was in great shape, both fairways and greens. Great value at this time of the year"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,This is a great course for the average golfer. The central and east nine are long but you can't get into much trouble from hazards.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Decent layout with a few scenic holes. Wooded layout with some tight driving holes. Creeks meandering through East & Central 9's affect some shots. First 2 hole on East are looong par 4's (451 & 444 from the WHITES!). Drive on East #8 is like threading a needle between huge tree in right fairway and woods/creek on left (which cuts into fairway more than you can see from tee).Course condition was just OK after recent heavy rains. Work was being done to improve (like new cart paths & renovation of some traps).
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"We played after heavy rains in the area so the ground was somewhat soft, but otherwise it was in great shape. The greens were like smooth carpet balls rolled true. The tees were manicured nicely. We got a great deal on Golf-now and that is what brought us here, but we will come back even without a great deal."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Course was in pretty good condition. A little wet in areas which was surprising considering there hadn't been much rain recently. This was my first time playing the course so I'm not sure if that's normal or if the course has some drainage problems. The biggest CON for me is the lack of yardage markers. I rely heavily on yardages and they are hard to come by on this course! I'd like to see more yardage markers, on sprinkler heads or in a yardage book. For the price of the course they could almost add gps to the carts...that would be a great addition."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,But the course was fun and challenging tee to green and I would play it again.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Tees, and fairways were in great shape. Greens were as fast as any I have played on this year. Sand traps needed a lot of attention as we had to play ""rake and place. You do have to use clubs other than driver off the tee but is that so bad? You see the players who make a living at this doing the same thing."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Had a great time. Brought three of my friends out to play Fox prairie for some golf and time to catch up with each other. Course was challenging but fair. We all really enjoyed the country scenery and agreed we will definitely be back. Didnt like the fact that GolfNow charges you full amount online through them now. Liked it better when you booked online with GolfNow they held your tee time and your foursome could settle up with course individually.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Shot my first round under par at this course so I found it short and easier than the normal courses I play. Course is in great shape! The greens rolled great late in the day! Course was busy but had no trouble playing in less than 4 hours.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Greens are massive and roll nicely. Several long par-4's from whoite tees, pretty fair challenge and interesting course."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"We played the Central/West 18 and were very pleased with the course. The greens are large, smooth, and have a decent pace too them. They are overly fast, but will the subtle breaks they are fast enough to be tricky. We found that some of the distance markings to the creeks seemed to be off, but that would be our only complaint about the course. Our tee time for a twosome was at 10:27 and we were finished around 1:30, so the pace of play was superb. Overall it was a great experience and we will be back for sure!"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"The architect accomplished a minor miracle incorporating a small creek to pose interest on many holes. Made me think! Greens are outstanding. Watering stations are needed on more holes & ladies would appreciate more course-side toilets. Pre-made sandwich was adequate from a cooler, and the attendant was very friendly. Overall facility was neat & clean. A model muni!"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,This was my first time playing this course and so it was an adventure not knowing what lied ahead. I was pleased with the design and degree of difficulty with some of the holes. Right off we were behind a 4 some who took 15 minutes to play the 1st hole but by the 3rd they let us play thru and never had another wait.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Course offers a great setting. Large, challenging greens. Fox Prairie has 3 nine-hole courses."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Booked tee times online , this was in the early afternoon during the week. The course wasn't busy , it's a city owned public course. when we arrived we find out the PRo has decided to pair us up with 2 other players, even thought the course was almost empty.The pro very not friendly or helpful , he kind of acted like I should know where the carts were located , where the 1st tee was , did i mention this is a 27 hole course and he had assigned us to the tees, and that we would be paired up with other players.This has only happened to me 2 other times on courses that were very busy during the moring hours, never during the week"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Have played course since 1993. It is still a good course with many challenging holes. Kept in very good condition.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,This is the best condition I've seen this course in. Green were in very good shape.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,The course was in excellent shape and the greens were putting fast. The cups hadn't been changed so there was weekend wear around all the holes. Would highly recomend this course to anyone.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,The course was in pretty bad condition when I played. The staff was decently friendly but we had a group behind us that were a bunch of old men and they were dicks. I would assume they are members there too. The pace of play was pretty good. I think their prices are outrageous for the course conditions but I was able to play for 19 dollars and I thought that was not bad.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,They keep this course in tip top shape. Great value for the money.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Overall good value for the $36 rate we played. Would play again.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Great day course very well kept. Greens were slow starting out but as the day progressed the greens firmed up. Well kept course and a great value.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Great course and very friendly staff. Thursday is the senior league day. I would not recommend playing on this day as all of the seniors I have encountered have very poor golf etiquette ie make it very clear they will not allow you to play through.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"We played Central to West in 3 hours, The course was in great shape. The greens were firm and consistent. For a City course it is a great value."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,This is a challenging course. The East 9's first 3 holes can put a hefty dent in your scorecard. Played the Central and East this day. Early in the year golf in Indiana = wet.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Course condition would have been pristine if not for the recent airation, greens are healling well though. With the wind against us, 1 and 2 on the East course are two of the toughest back to back par fours I've played this year."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,heck of a deal for 25$ course is in great shape. greens were perfect

Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,I enjoy playing here. Although the greens had been recently aerated they were in good shape. My two playing partners had not played here and they liked the course.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Tough off the tee; kept the driver bagged and hit three wood all day. Great course for the money.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Fox prarie is a nice layout and a good value for the money.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"You can never go wrong by playing Fox Prairie. Ever visit of mine presented a well maintained course. The regular players take care of their course, too. That's not seen on every public course."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Good value and I like the fact that there are 27 holes here. My husband kept saying how pretty some of the views from the tee boxes are. It's challenging, especially with many sand traps bordering greens and trees on many holes. My group and I had fun, however, there were some fairways that needed attention and the rough seemed incredibly dry and hard. Also, the greens didn't seem consistent, some were very fast and super hard where your ball just wouldn't stick, and some were slow, which made attempting to read greens very hard. Overall, a pretty nice track if you want an affordable round. Seemed pretty long for the ladies. GPS would be helpful but luckily you can download an app for that on any android phone. Much better than expected for a municipal course!"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,The course was in pretty good shape. The greens were flat out immaculate. First time playing this course as I wasn't familiar with it until I took a chance and booked it. Very surprised and will definitely play here more.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"We played the Central & East courses. Great combination of challenge and playability. Golf course was in excellent condition. Not sure why I haven't played here more often, but this will definitely become a multiple stop in the rotation. Great value."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Fantastic course to play at. We got a huge deal with playing this course through GolfNow. The course was well maintained, but there was some rough areas that were tapped off along the fairways. There are 3 nine hole courses, Central, East, and West. I recommend Central then East because this was the original course when this club was built. Still, I cannot wait to return to play West next. The greens were the best I've seen on a course this year. All in all, great place to play and Fox Prairie always keeps their course in great playing condition."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,I have played this course every week and it still is in great shape
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Played on the afternoon of August 1, 2013. Course was in good condition, dry, fast fairways and greens that were in good conditions and were quick. Course is parkland style with trees on or near fairways. Very playable course for all levels of players. Played in less than 4 hours. 3 of the par 3's played about the same distance,175 yards, which is somewhat annoying, but other than that I would recommend playing."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"We played Fox Prairie Central and East courses. There are several narrow driving holes and some difficult tree placement to deal with. The course is in great shape and the greens are some of the best in central Indiana. There are also several streams that run down the sides and across fairways, giving you some decisions to make off the tee. Great course for the price, highly recommend."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,It was a beautiful day and the course was good we played the central and east course.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Overall, a great value for the money. I paid $18 and change (with tax). Impressed at the condition for a city course."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"the only thing i'm not happy about is that they never let you play the west course. i really enjoy that 9 holes. other than that, the fairways are in good condition. the greens run well. people do not fix there divot holes. i was constantly fixing them on every green...."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Have played the course many times, in fact, used to be a member. Played Central West and had a great time. Excellent condition, greens were in great shape, if you can't putt these, you can't putt, period."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"This was my first time to play this course, having been told by friends that it was worth playing. I was not disappointed, and will certainly play it again. Course has several loooong par 4 holes for the average golfer, making it a great challenge. Greens were in great condition, and a bit faster than most around the area. Again, making it a good challenge."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"I normally break 100 at most courses, 90 on a good day and this course was a great challenge for me(shot 97). Had the perfect amount of trees/bunkers/doglegs and there were holes I played terribly but there was also a hole I birdied and another two I had birdie putts. Normally courses like this aren't kept very well but this was was in great shape. The greens were the best kept I've seen in indy all year."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,This course has a nice layout and great price for what you get
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Nice older course with lots of character. Enjoyed the East course much more than Central.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"Always base course conditions on the greens, and these were fantastic. Approach shots are difficult because they are firm, but they are extremely smooth surfaces, some of the best I've played on"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,This is only the second time I have played this course and it was in great shape. The holes are all different and they had some drivable par 4's (which I like).
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Central course was the most challenging with trees lining most fairways and multiple dog legs throughout course.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Course was in good shape. Would play again for the right price.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Ended up playing 36 and the replay rate was only the cost of a cart.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Great deal for the frugal golfer.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"The course was well manicured and reasonably well marked. Cart paths and bridges could use some work, but overall a course that we will play again."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"This course makes you hit every club in your bag. It offers a great testNo matter your skill level. From the tips, it offers a challenge ,whatever your handicap.It has some of the largest greens in the area, so you will have several ,opportunities to practice your 40+ feet lag putting."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,I found this course to be a really good deal for the money. It was not an especially unique or beautiful course but it was certainly very well maintained. Found for a great price. I just wish the pace of play was a little quicker. Got stuck behind a foursome of older gentlemen and had to wait on the tee and 2nd shot every time until the turn when they finally let us pass. I would say worth it to go play.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,The course Central/East was in good condition. The wind was blowing 20+ miles per hour with gusts of wind blowing any bad shot the wrong way. The course is very fair and enjoyable.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,"The fairways and greens are in very good condition. I would play there again if there was a good price on golfnow. I would not want to pay the full price green fees. Overall, it was a good course and a good experience."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,This is a beautiful course that is a bit confusing because it is 3 nine hole courses put together. so it is just difficult to figure out where to go next.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The Central/West Golf Course,24901-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-central-west-golf-course,Nice course at a good price.  Greens are in great shape.
Chatham Hills - Championship Golf Course,35609-chatham-hills-championship-golf-course,"If you get a chance to get on here, don’t pass it up. Tee to green it was in perfect condition. Beautiful, fun layout, especially the back 9. There are scorable holes but overall very challenging course. Firmest and fastest greens I’ve ever played, even well struck wedges weren’t staying put. I’ll reiterate what the earlier poster mentioned, play the appropriate tees for your skill level. This course will chew you up if you step back beyond the tees you should be playing. I’ve tried many of the private courses in town and would put this one at the top."
Chatham Hills - Championship Golf Course,35609-chatham-hills-championship-golf-course,"The Club at Chatham Hills is a new, private Pete Dye course just north of Indianapolis. The topography is wonderful for golf -- lots of elevation changes, natural water features -- and Dye and his staff have done their usual artful job with it. Bunkers and greens are excellent (already), and fairways will grow in fully by early next summer. Since it just opened in Oct. 2016, it was still a little rough around the edges (be careful stepping off of tee boxes -- I twisted my ankle badly on No. 1, and it still hurts). Two main pieces of advice: 1) Choose the appropriate tee boxes for your skull level; playing too far back will result in a LONG, SLOW day (as when I played with some guys who decided the tips, or close to them, were for them). Our 5.5 hour round could have been a 4-hour round if we hadn't been looking for balls and hitting multiple shots most of the day. 2) Keep the ball below the hole, which is tricky with the firm greens. With greens running at 11+ on the Stimp meter, downhill putts are nearly impossible to stop. Once the clubhouse is built, the amenities will be 5-star."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Haven't reviewed this course in a couple years so I figured I'd provide an update.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"Start in the pro shop where the attitude of ""good enough for government work"" is on full display - the people checking you in act like it's a complete burden for them to do so and have quite an attitude. How dare I want to play golf? Carts are ok, but have no windshield."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"Course itself is in its usual shape - patchy here and there and some greens on the East 9 had water damage spots but overall not bad. Sand traps are very inconsistent, like they dumped it all in the traps closest to the clubhouse and forgot about the rest. Several are as much dirt/mud as they are sand, then some are thicker than an elementary school sandbox."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"Clientele trends to the older side, and they play at there pace and do not care if you're behind them. Skip holes if you need to when stuck behind these guys that act like they own the place., it's fairly easy to do so given the layout, especially on the East 9. Don't expect to see a ranger. Also don't expect those guys to fix a ball mark. The greens were recently punched as well, adding to the fun on the greens, which were at a decent pace today."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"All in all you can do worse, but there is better around. The Monday $29 special is a decent rate. But don't go out of your way to do it."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,We enjoyed playing this very nice looking course! We look forward to playing again sometime!
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"I haven't played this course in a long time, it played fast and is very nice, I'd recommend this course, we had a great time. Thanks"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,I always enjoy this course. It had been a little dry but everything was still in good condition.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"The course was in good shape despite the lack of rain for the past month. My wife and I were a twosome, and pace of play was good."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Loved the challenging layout and excellent course condition- definetly will be playing this course again.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,It had quit raining when I arrived and the course wasn't busy. I teamed up with three guys who played the course often and we had a great round(Not the score).
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"27 holes in all seems to keep pace of play steady, even on a gorgeous Saturday afternoon. The East 9 is the most challenging with elevation changes and blind shots that are not common in central Indiana. Greens were in good shape, as were most of the bunkers. Not terribly long, but a tight layout keeps it challenging."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Pro Shop staff very efficient & friendly and helpful....Course in fine shape and greens roll true.....
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Will definitely return this summer
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Nice layout，some long Par 4 and great challenge - highly recommended.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Greens were extremely quick but rolled smooth. Excellent value and course condition for price. Will definitely be back.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"Being my local muni, I've played the 3 courses here several times now. West is the easiest and most mundane of the 3. Central is a solid 9, with a couple tight holes, and a couple open holes making for a nice mix. East has a few holes that need to be destroyed, starting with the huge tree on 8 in the middle of the fairway. I have yet to figure out the best way to play that hole. The first hole on that side is tough too, as is the long 2nd with a narrow green with a lot of break."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"The course is in good shape after all the rain recently. Greens rolled quick even late in the day. Sand, predictably after the deluge, could use an overhaul. Everything else was in good shape. It's not a course you'll rave about, but you can do a lot worse than here, especially when it's not busy and you can cruise around."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,The course is in the best shape of any course in town. The Best Buy for the buck.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"Course was in fantastic shape for fall. Greens rolled very nice. There were some branches that had fallen off the trees due to high wind the day before on some of the tee boxes that were kind of annoying, but can't really complain about that."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,It was cold and the leaves were so deep it was easy to lose balls. I spent way too much time looking for my ball as I didn't always hit the fairway and it had a lot of leaves. t is a fun course and I will play it again when they rake the leaves.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,This was a beautiful course. It was challenging but I am a beginner golfer.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,I played the center and east courses. The East course was beautiful and had excellent terrain. I ended up taking longer than I probably should have taking in the fall colors.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"We arrived to the course around 2:20 and teed off around 2:35. We played a normal round, albeit a little slow because we let a few twosomes pass up so we didn't hold up traffic. At 6:30, we teed off on 18, and a woman from the pro shop came out and yelled at us to bring the carts in. We asked her if we could finish, and she yelled at us more and accused us of playing extra holes. We explained we didn't play extra holes, we had only been out there for about 4 hours (including a 30 minute break to eat after 9) and that we had let people pass through and were not informed of any pace of play rules. She said she didn't care and that we had played extra holes and blocked us from continuing to play. We took the carts in, without finishing, and noticed that she was already in her car ready to leave. It leaves a horrible taste in your mouth when you get kicked off a course so the woman working can leave before we can finish, even though we paid for a full 18. We will definitely be taking our business elsewhere, and advising our friends to do the same."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"Good mix of water, sand and trees. Has somesurprises. A straight hitter can do well on thiscourse, but if you scatter your shots, you willbe in trouble early and often."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Fun to play and challenging. Good price for thiscourse.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,First time to play Fox Prairie and we were pleasantly surprised. The course was not flat and boring as we anticipated and as some Indiana courses are. It was in excellent condition. We enjoyed our day!
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Nice course for $30-40 range on the weekends (typical golfnow deal for this course).

Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"Each of the three 9 hole layouts have their own unique challenges. Up and downs streams and lakes and bunkers protecting the greens. The greens, tee boxes and the fairways were all great to play on. The speed of play was good the day I played. As a single it took me seven holes to catch up with a threesome and they were gracious enough to allow me to play through. Good day and a great course made for an excellent day."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,First nine holes pace of play very slow due to slow play of foursome in front of us. Never saw a ranger or staff member out checking on course play.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Passed the slow foursome at the turn and the back nine played in under two hours.

Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"It's hard not to give this facility 5 stars. I have played here twice in the past few weeks and my rounds here are anywhere from good to great, depending on how firm and true the greens are rolling.This is a ""golfers golf course"".... You will use all your clubs, play a variety of holes and shots, etc. The worst condition I have played it in was ""Good"" and sometimes it is Excellent. The head pro is a PRO and runs things extremely well.The selfish side of this would be ignore all my accolades of the course as I really enjoy the great pace of play here! :-) This is definitely 1 of the best values in town and offers plenty of resistance to scoring, depending on the tee you elect to play.Kudos to Fox staff"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Course in good shape. Makes you use a variety of clubs.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Very good value for the Golf Now price. Mid-afternoon tee time during the week and only took 3 hours to play 18.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,I found a great deal for about 20 bucks to play this course. This is one that I don't play that often and it's probably been a few years that has played it. But I was pleasantly surprised with the condition of the greens and the fairways. Layout was ok. Some cool holes. Nothing spectacular. But greens rolled very true the day in played.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Not very busy because of weather. Good for me. 18 in 2 hours. Between par and bogey golf and great practice in the wind conditions. Greens were true after the tree droppings were moved out of the way..
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Its a little long for older players.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Friendly folks at pro shop/snack bar but I had higher expectations for the course. Blind shots were ok but greens weren't overly challenging and bunkers were washed out completely. No GPS on carts or knowledge published on hole placements (could have missed posting). Tee boxes tore up and annoyed with foot soccer course on west. Understand need for revenue from foot soccer but I'm a purist. Overall not bad but for the price but I'll stick to pebble brook or sahms
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,We played the Central and East . . . Over all the course was ok. . . The greens was okay a little slow . . . Me and my son just got back from Myrtle Beach so you know the greens will slow but for this time of year the course was in pretty good shape. . . Going to be nice to play this summer though overall I give it about a three-and-a-half to four stars . . Very good for the value . . . Played the West course so we played 27 holes and the west course was what we played last . . . Played real good went Two over on that side . . . Overall nice place to play golf . . . West side is for foot golf so beware if you play the west side you'll be waiting on them to kick a soccer ball in a hole and in your rough. . . Kinda Different? ? ? ? ?
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,This course is close to our home and is always fun to play. I was surprised what good condition the course was in this early in the season. A lot of down trees however. I prefer the Central and East side.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Great course for the money. I would play it anytime.Fun to play and challenging.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Nice golf course well maintained a few challenging holes.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"This course is one of the best kept courses in the Indy area. Very plush. I played as a single riding and tee it up about 10am. I buzzed around for about 12 holes and then I think I must have caught up with the mens club or something. Lots of senior foursomes walking on every hole. Playing thru would not have helped, so I quit. I would suggest if you play as a single riding, you may want to wait a little later to start. Love this course."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"This is a great municipal course north of Indy. The course is in great shape. It is fair, yet challenging."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"A very good golf course with many tree lined holes. The course was in excellent shape. The greens are very large , held well hit shots and putts rolled very true. I enjoyed the course and will play again soon."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"Course was in good condition. The course was very busy, but pace of play was very good. Not until the last few holes did we have to wait between shots. Course was in good condition and staff was very friendly. Would definitely play this course again."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Played 18 holes in a little over 3 hours. Lots of fun.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"Played course on my 71st birthday. Weather was perfect and the course was in great shape. Gorgeous, mature course, especially the middle and east nines."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Will play again as soon as possible.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Small town feel with large greens and wide fairways
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Highly recommended. Great condition of fairways and greens. Will play again.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"Course was in decent shape though I didn't like a few holes on the East side. Such as the one with a giant tree in the middle of the fairway. But it was in decent shape except for the traps after all the poor weather earlier in the summer. The greens were a bit rock hard and not very receptive. Overall, It's worth a go, especially at the hot deal rate."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Staff was great! Course was in great shape! Played on Friday afternoon and course was nearly empty until later. No problem with pace.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"Nice course, has 3 nines and mingles between narrow tree lined fairways to some areas that are pretty wide open. Greens were in great shape and rolled well, and they are very big greens."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Would like to see GPS in the carts as some greens were 30yds deep and going off sprinkler heads is a bit tough.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Extra care is required where to place your drive on dogleg fairways.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"As a duffer, I found this course to be challenging. Played from the white tees and found the distance to be a little long. Course was well maintained although some small areas were under repair. Facilities good and staff friendly. I prefer more distance stakes to judge my shots but most courses seem to be removing them since many use GPS or range finders."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Because of raining was not busy. We were able to get off early and enjoyed a fast playing round! Golf pro was nice and accommodating.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Course was in good condition this early in the season.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"very traditional course with some very long par 3's. Course was in great shape, both fairways and greens. Great value at this time of the year"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,This is a great course for the average golfer. The central and east nine are long but you can't get into much trouble from hazards.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Decent layout with a few scenic holes. Wooded layout with some tight driving holes. Creeks meandering through East & Central 9's affect some shots. First 2 hole on East are looong par 4's (451 & 444 from the WHITES!). Drive on East #8 is like threading a needle between huge tree in right fairway and woods/creek on left (which cuts into fairway more than you can see from tee).Course condition was just OK after recent heavy rains. Work was being done to improve (like new cart paths & renovation of some traps).
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"We played after heavy rains in the area so the ground was somewhat soft, but otherwise it was in great shape. The greens were like smooth carpet balls rolled true. The tees were manicured nicely. We got a great deal on Golf-now and that is what brought us here, but we will come back even without a great deal."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"Course was in pretty good condition. A little wet in areas which was surprising considering there hadn't been much rain recently. This was my first time playing the course so I'm not sure if that's normal or if the course has some drainage problems. The biggest CON for me is the lack of yardage markers. I rely heavily on yardages and they are hard to come by on this course! I'd like to see more yardage markers, on sprinkler heads or in a yardage book. For the price of the course they could almost add gps to the carts...that would be a great addition."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,But the course was fun and challenging tee to green and I would play it again.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"Tees, and fairways were in great shape. Greens were as fast as any I have played on this year. Sand traps needed a lot of attention as we had to play ""rake and place. You do have to use clubs other than driver off the tee but is that so bad? You see the players who make a living at this doing the same thing."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Had a great time. Brought three of my friends out to play Fox prairie for some golf and time to catch up with each other. Course was challenging but fair. We all really enjoyed the country scenery and agreed we will definitely be back. Didnt like the fact that GolfNow charges you full amount online through them now. Liked it better when you booked online with GolfNow they held your tee time and your foursome could settle up with course individually.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Shot my first round under par at this course so I found it short and easier than the normal courses I play. Course is in great shape! The greens rolled great late in the day! Course was busy but had no trouble playing in less than 4 hours.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"Greens are massive and roll nicely. Several long par-4's from whoite tees, pretty fair challenge and interesting course."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"We played the Central/West 18 and were very pleased with the course. The greens are large, smooth, and have a decent pace too them. They are overly fast, but will the subtle breaks they are fast enough to be tricky. We found that some of the distance markings to the creeks seemed to be off, but that would be our only complaint about the course. Our tee time for a twosome was at 10:27 and we were finished around 1:30, so the pace of play was superb. Overall it was a great experience and we will be back for sure!"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"The architect accomplished a minor miracle incorporating a small creek to pose interest on many holes. Made me think! Greens are outstanding. Watering stations are needed on more holes & ladies would appreciate more course-side toilets. Pre-made sandwich was adequate from a cooler, and the attendant was very friendly. Overall facility was neat & clean. A model muni!"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,This was my first time playing this course and so it was an adventure not knowing what lied ahead. I was pleased with the design and degree of difficulty with some of the holes. Right off we were behind a 4 some who took 15 minutes to play the 1st hole but by the 3rd they let us play thru and never had another wait.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"Course offers a great setting. Large, challenging greens. Fox Prairie has 3 nine-hole courses."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"Booked tee times online , this was in the early afternoon during the week. The course wasn't busy , it's a city owned public course. when we arrived we find out the PRo has decided to pair us up with 2 other players, even thought the course was almost empty.The pro very not friendly or helpful , he kind of acted like I should know where the carts were located , where the 1st tee was , did i mention this is a 27 hole course and he had assigned us to the tees, and that we would be paired up with other players.This has only happened to me 2 other times on courses that were very busy during the moring hours, never during the week"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Have played course since 1993. It is still a good course with many challenging holes. Kept in very good condition.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,This is the best condition I've seen this course in. Green were in very good shape.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,The course was in excellent shape and the greens were putting fast. The cups hadn't been changed so there was weekend wear around all the holes. Would highly recomend this course to anyone.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,The course was in pretty bad condition when I played. The staff was decently friendly but we had a group behind us that were a bunch of old men and they were dicks. I would assume they are members there too. The pace of play was pretty good. I think their prices are outrageous for the course conditions but I was able to play for 19 dollars and I thought that was not bad.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,They keep this course in tip top shape. Great value for the money.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Overall good value for the $36 rate we played. Would play again.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Great day course very well kept. Greens were slow starting out but as the day progressed the greens firmed up. Well kept course and a great value.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Great course and very friendly staff. Thursday is the senior league day. I would not recommend playing on this day as all of the seniors I have encountered have very poor golf etiquette ie make it very clear they will not allow you to play through.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"We played Central to West in 3 hours, The course was in great shape. The greens were firm and consistent. For a City course it is a great value."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,This is a challenging course. The East 9's first 3 holes can put a hefty dent in your scorecard. Played the Central and East this day. Early in the year golf in Indiana = wet.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"Course condition would have been pristine if not for the recent airation, greens are healling well though. With the wind against us, 1 and 2 on the East course are two of the toughest back to back par fours I've played this year."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,heck of a deal for 25$ course is in great shape. greens were perfect
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,pros;friendly staffgood fairwaysgood bunkers-nice size greensCons;greens oversandedpoor or non-existing fairways or par3 yardage markers!No GPS
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,I enjoy playing here. Although the greens had been recently aerated they were in good shape. My two playing partners had not played here and they liked the course.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Tough off the tee; kept the driver bagged and hit three wood all day. Great course for the money.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Fox prarie is a nice layout and a good value for the money.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"You can never go wrong by playing Fox Prairie. Ever visit of mine presented a well maintained course. The regular players take care of their course, too. That's not seen on every public course."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"Good value and I like the fact that there are 27 holes here. My husband kept saying how pretty some of the views from the tee boxes are. It's challenging, especially with many sand traps bordering greens and trees on many holes. My group and I had fun, however, there were some fairways that needed attention and the rough seemed incredibly dry and hard. Also, the greens didn't seem consistent, some were very fast and super hard where your ball just wouldn't stick, and some were slow, which made attempting to read greens very hard. Overall, a pretty nice track if you want an affordable round. Seemed pretty long for the ladies. GPS would be helpful but luckily you can download an app for that on any android phone. Much better than expected for a municipal course!"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,The course was in pretty good shape. The greens were flat out immaculate. First time playing this course as I wasn't familiar with it until I took a chance and booked it. Very surprised and will definitely play here more.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"We played the Central & East courses. Great combination of challenge and playability. Golf course was in excellent condition. Not sure why I haven't played here more often, but this will definitely become a multiple stop in the rotation. Great value."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"Fantastic course to play at. We got a huge deal with playing this course through GolfNow. The course was well maintained, but there was some rough areas that were tapped off along the fairways. There are 3 nine hole courses, Central, East, and West. I recommend Central then East because this was the original course when this club was built. Still, I cannot wait to return to play West next. The greens were the best I've seen on a course this year. All in all, great place to play and Fox Prairie always keeps their course in great playing condition."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,I have played this course every week and it still is in great shape
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"Played on the afternoon of August 1, 2013. Course was in good condition, dry, fast fairways and greens that were in good conditions and were quick. Course is parkland style with trees on or near fairways. Very playable course for all levels of players. Played in less than 4 hours. 3 of the par 3's played about the same distance,175 yards, which is somewhat annoying, but other than that I would recommend playing."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"We played Fox Prairie Central and East courses. There are several narrow driving holes and some difficult tree placement to deal with. The course is in great shape and the greens are some of the best in central Indiana. There are also several streams that run down the sides and across fairways, giving you some decisions to make off the tee. Great course for the price, highly recommend."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,It was a beautiful day and the course was good we played the central and east course.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"Overall, a great value for the money. I paid $18 and change (with tax). Impressed at the condition for a city course."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"the only thing i'm not happy about is that they never let you play the west course. i really enjoy that 9 holes. other than that, the fairways are in good condition. the greens run well. people do not fix there divot holes. i was constantly fixing them on every green...."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"Have played the course many times, in fact, used to be a member. Played Central West and had a great time. Excellent condition, greens were in great shape, if you can't putt these, you can't putt, period."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"This was my first time to play this course, having been told by friends that it was worth playing. I was not disappointed, and will certainly play it again. Course has several loooong par 4 holes for the average golfer, making it a great challenge. Greens were in great condition, and a bit faster than most around the area. Again, making it a good challenge."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"I normally break 100 at most courses, 90 on a good day and this course was a great challenge for me(shot 97). Had the perfect amount of trees/bunkers/doglegs and there were holes I played terribly but there was also a hole I birdied and another two I had birdie putts. Normally courses like this aren't kept very well but this was was in great shape. The greens were the best kept I've seen in indy all year."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,This course has a nice layout and great price for what you get
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Nice older course with lots of character. Enjoyed the East course much more than Central.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"Always base course conditions on the greens, and these were fantastic. Approach shots are difficult because they are firm, but they are extremely smooth surfaces, some of the best I've played on"
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,This is only the second time I have played this course and it was in great shape. The holes are all different and they had some drivable par 4's (which I like).
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Central course was the most challenging with trees lining most fairways and multiple dog legs throughout course.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Course was in good shape. Would play again for the right price.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Ended up playing 36 and the replay rate was only the cost of a cart.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Great deal for the frugal golfer.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"The course was well manicured and reasonably well marked. Cart paths and bridges could use some work, but overall a course that we will play again."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"This course makes you hit every club in your bag. It offers a great testNo matter your skill level. From the tips, it offers a challenge ,whatever your handicap.It has some of the largest greens in the area, so you will have several ,opportunities to practice your 40+ feet lag putting."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,I found this course to be a really good deal for the money. It was not an especially unique or beautiful course but it was certainly very well maintained. Found for a great price. I just wish the pace of play was a little quicker. Got stuck behind a foursome of older gentlemen and had to wait on the tee and 2nd shot every time until the turn when they finally let us pass. I would say worth it to go play.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,The course Central/East was in good condition. The wind was blowing 20+ miles per hour with gusts of wind blowing any bad shot the wrong way. The course is very fair and enjoyable.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,"The fairways and greens are in very good condition. I would play there again if there was a good price on golfnow. I would not want to pay the full price green fees. Overall, it was a good course and a good experience."
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,This is a beautiful course that is a bit confusing because it is 3 nine hole courses put together. so it is just difficult to figure out where to go next.
Fox Prairie Golf Club - The East/West Course,5900-fox-prairie-golf-club-the-east-west-course,Nice course at a good price.  Greens are in great shape.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Booked tee time on Golf Now. Drove 45 minutes to play the round of golf and Hawks Tail said they do not honor Golf Now anymore. Could have put this on their website! Wanted to charge another $55 for us to play. Then trying to get refund on Golf Now is ridiculous. Would not recommend playing this course due to the Customer Service. Also, would not recommend to use Golf Now for any tee times! Both customer services completely suck!"
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,The course has ended the partnership with golf now which led to a very awkward conversation come tee time. They let me play but weren't too happy about it.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,my group plays this course 3-4 times a year but with the ridiculous increase in green fees this course will be off our list of courses to play. $55 for green fees for this course is way over priced and the condition of the course did not merit this increase.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Booked a tee time online Thursday evening, arrived at the course to be told we couldn't play because they had a tournament going. No ""sorry about the inconvenience"" or any words of responsibility for not having this on the website."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,They said they no longer use GolfNow for tee times. Didn’t have me scheduled when I went in and charged extra. I was lied to and overcharged. Glad the front nine is going away soon.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,They said they were stopping and no longer using GolfNow. They had no idea of my Tee time and I had to show them my email confirmation. Thankfully they honored my Tee time as I had driven 45 minutes to their course.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,1. THEY AREN’T ACCEPTING GOLFNOW TEE TIMES- which is a wrong move in there part to be honest2. Tee boxes- where great still wondering what they are going to do with the Par Hole #113. Fairways- Awesome and some are narrow but really good4. Greens- Great Greens some confuse you but other are pretty straight forward5. Layout’s - For some holes you have to strategize meaning Hole 5 Par 4 and Hole 8 Par 5 ball placement is a must and All of the par 3’s are challenging all have creek or water
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"We was bless to play this course again in a rainy day the Golf junkies where out to play. I got there around 0645 and we had about two or three golfers getting ready to tee off but we started by 0715. The Tee box where great, awesome fairways and greens. The Golf community in Greenfield is outstanding best kept secret in the area. The pace of play was great by the 12 hole the rain started but it was still light enough for us to squeeze 18 holes. This is my third time playing here and will keep coming is the best golf course in the area great job Hawktail’s employees keep the good work."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Even though tee times are posted for this course they do not take them. The man at the counter was quite rude in telling me this. Told me to get refund from Golfnow (which I did) and I would have to pay the course if I wanted to play…to the tune of $41. This course isn’t worth that so I left.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,I would like to say again…the man at the counter was VERY rude in telling me this. I would not play there just because of that.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,They did not accept the booking from golf now and was more than double the price from golf now. Plus the 8 dollars I lost booking on golf now to a corse that doesn’t accept it
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,The course is pretty fun for the price but it's closed for the winter. You can still book on Golfnow but then you will have to figure out how to get your money back.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,We drove 50 minutes to play this course after booking on Golf Now and when we got there they charged us an extra $20 because they claimed to not be affiliated with Golf Now anymore. They said they’ve had issues trying to get removed from the site but they are still aware of their deal and are charging people an extra fee. The course was nothing special and definitely not worth driving out of the way to.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Great course, amazing holes, and fantastic staff.Well worth a visit"
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Several left to right dog legs where you have to hit a fade come into play, 8 is ridiculous. Definitely a tee shot focused course vs second. 9 and 18 are the only two holes best fit for a baby draw. Played super soft but greens were true just slow understandably. Tee boxes were not flat or well kept"
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Golfnow will not accept cancellation and course wouldn’t take my money so I got my money taken away and no golf was allowed how is this even possible very disappointed in the app!!
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Showed up on Father’s Day and was informed if I wanted to play it would cost $110 vs $90 agreed to on GN. They said they do not work with GN anymore and if I wanted to play I had to pay $110. I left. Today I see more tee times available for Hawks Tail at discounted rates.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Thanks Hawks Tail. I will not be back.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"I booked a tee time using golf now for 2:07, then I showed up before my tee time and they said they don’t use golf now anymore and that I couldn’t play. So this place stinks don’t book a tee time thru this app."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"When we arrived, they said they no longer accept golf now even though I had already paid for it through GolfNow, and then act like I was a crook or something, and said he will let me play this time, but if he ever sees my face there again he won’t let me, so I will not be going back to this golf course, and I would not recommend this golf course to anybody"
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"There was no flag on the green and no cards were provided. If you want to make a reservation, please do something about it. I was disappointed"
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Hidden gem! Staff was super nice and course was in great condition
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Was my first time here and I will definitely be coming back! My new hidden treasure!
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Greens in decent shape. Fairways & tee boxes weren’t mowed. Kinda unfortunate for a holiday weekend. Still enjoyed my round.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"This is a great course, most friendly staff and layout is fantastic.I finished 18 holes in under 3 hours on a Wednesday morning."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Greens rolled true except #13. Hot spots all over that green. Fairways were not dense enough to play the course without rolling the ball. If you play the the ball down you will not be satisfied with this place. But if you roll the ball, this course would be a fun time for your crew.Some weed growth around and poor bunkers but greens are still good enough to make up for it.Would recommend it for <$40 to ride."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Wanted to play someplace new and found a really good deal for this course. Not overly difficult, though some accuracy is required off a few tees. Course was in good shape and the staff very friendly. Pace of play was great. Glad I made the drive."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Very nice course. The person at the desk was very nice. The price was really low for this quality course.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"The course is in great shape. The only down side would be that the greens were a little slow. In the past, the greens were slick. It may be due to the amount of rain."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"In all my years of playing golf (35+ yrs) I have never left in the middle of round... well we did at Hawks Tail.As we sat on #15 tee box we were already 5 hours in, so it was going to be a 6+hr round plus the fact there was no water coolers avail on the entire course (90* & humid)-- we packed up and left.The courses grass is awesome if you want a nice bluegrass lawn for a house, just not what you want for fairways-- way too high, too thick.The back 9 is exceptionally long & not player friendly- they could shorten numerous back 9 holes 30-40yds and they would still be long holes.We followed a two-some the entire front 9 that was getting golf instruction on the course as they ""played"" & never offered for us to go around (we were a two-some also).I would not recommend nor play again, way too many better options in the Indy area market.Some positives-- the greens were in very good shape & rolled well, yet kind of slow. We also liked the clearly marked yardages on the cart paths."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"I haven't played here in the last year or so. However, the course conditions were poor compared to the past. Lots of bare spots in the fairways. Some poor surfaces on some greens. Lots of dandelions in all roughs. Staff was friendly. But I probably won't play there again this year due to the condition of the course.It was pretty windy this time (obviously not the fault of the course)The course is longer than average. And there wasn't much advantage for senior tees on most holes. I'm 75 years old and not a long hitter. So that makes a difference to me."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Hawks tail is a nice little course for the money. I've played here roughly 15 times, and they must be giving a discount this year because of conditions. I know for a fact I paid 35, last year and it was 27 this year and the course is rough. Lots of weeds, lots of dead spots. I'd say I moved my ball at least 10 times because I was in dirt where grass should be. No biggie with the discount, but if you're looking for plush fairways and better conditions, Hawks Tail is going to need some time. The layout is pretty nice and slightly above average. 17 is a nice challenge par 3 over water, 18 is a blind par 4 dogleg left that really makes you want to go over the trees for the miracle. Last but not least, it's Greenfield IN., and just like every other course in rural Indiana, you will deal with the neckbeards. This place is better than most around here, but be prepared for people who don't fill or fix divots, golf in jeans and basketball shorts, play music loudly from their carts, drive into your tee box, and litter the course. Just like most things, the place would be much nicer without the people who inhabit it."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Pace of play was perfect for an afternoon round. Staff was very friendly, can’t beat the value!"
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,We enjoyed our day and the other golfers on the course were very polite!
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"I booked on Golf Now and met three friends here.. I had already paid and they checked in so I went straight to the first hole. On hole two I was in the fairway taking my second shot when the young guy who worked their came out. My friends yelled that he was telling them it’s cart path only. I honestly did not know and waved an apologetic wave and moved the cart. The guy then proceeded to tell my friends to not let it happen again insinuating he would kick us out. I apologized at the turn and told him I thought his comment was a little much and he proceeded to tell me two more times with smirk on his face and also reminded me he could kick us out. I told him that’s not a way to treat your guests and walked on. I was more than nice and apologetic for an honest mistake. I thought the attitude was unwarranted. Needless to say the young guy in the clear frame glasses seems to be on a power trip. Also none of the ball wash stations had water, divot fill was empty on all carts, and the tee boxes were a mess. I’ll never be back."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Was a little busy and felt rushed but overall good course
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Flat course with not a whole lot going on, other than a couple small ponds in a creek running through it not much trouble to get into. Fairways were almost as long as the rough and the tea boxes even had long grass growing on them. The greens were the only saving grace, they rolled pretty smooth but did not seem to break the way they should. But most greens didn't even have a fringe on them so if you missed the green by a foot you were in the rough and got penalized."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"There was a tournament while I was there, assuming that’s why the price was so good for 17 and a cart, but everyone was friendly.The course itself was in good shape, open fairways, not too difficult. Some long par 5s to shake it up which was nice. The rough wasn’t too thick that you’d lose your ball and the greens were pretty true. All in all good place to play"
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Overall nice layout to the course. Pace of play was average at best. Course greens keeping was lacking for this time of year.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Course tee boxes were crab grass. Fairways were crab grass. Made for very difficult play even if in the fairway bc you can’t get a good lie.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"So sad to see Crab Grass on Tees, Fairways and Fringes! Disappointing. If this was known would have played elsewhere.Greens are in good condition no crab grass."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Fairways are terrible. Greens are not kept well. No way should you ever spend $40 to play here. Should be a 1-2 star course and 10-15$ at peek times
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Typical community course. Conditions of fairways were beat up and the greens had some bare spots in them. The layout isnt bad to get in a little practice. Staff was extremely friendly and the highlight of the course!
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"They are doing some makeovers (filling in old bunkers, etc), but this is a nice little course."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,The staff was very friendly and accommodating . The greens were in great condition and overall the grounds were well kept.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Course was in great condition for this time of the year.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Course was nicely laid out. Staff was amazing and very friendly. Clubhouse was good for a small town course, the beverage and food prices were great! The course is in pretty bad condition. Greens were ate up and there is a lack of any kind of fairway, and all the grass is full of weeds. If the course was in much better shape, would be good for the money, but until it gets there, don’t pay full price to play. Loved the course layout though. Overall, it was just okay."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,The course has a beautiful layout but they’re not taking care of lotta crab grass and weeds in the fairway it was hard to tell the fairway from the ruff
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Played on a Tuesday late morning by myself. The course was in great shape.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Well kept course, great beer prices and friendly folks"
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Needs good reconditioning. Staff not on top of things. Could do well under new management. We'll see
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Course in good shape. Greens were good besides people not repairing divots, not courses fault. Enjoyed my round. Will def go back!"
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Course in great condition. Greens run true and with pace, love that."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Enjoyed playing this course today. Wasn’t many people on the course at 10am, so the pace was great. Only real disappointment was the condition of the greens. Whether it was the grounds crew or inconsiderate players, the amount of ball marks on the greens was an issue. Overall, a straightforward course and an otherwise good day."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Really enjoyed the round. Greens were in good shape and rolled true. It was a hot day with a nice breeze. Look forward to going back.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Although soaking wet from the recent rains, the curse was playable and in good shape given the weather. Always a good pace of play, and reasonably priced."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"This course will be a good course to, if it ever quits raining so they can keep up with all of the mowing. The greens were good but the rough in areas were tall. It took some time to find your ball. I'm sure this will be remedied when the weather clears up and they have a full staff on board for the summer."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"We played in 3hrs and 45 mins. A little soggy from a previous storm,but playable and greens were quick and true. We'll definitely return to play again!"
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"The tee boxes, fairways, and roughs were well maintained. The greens are very small and the bunkers were in bad shape. The staff was very friendly. I think the course is a bit overpriced. Pretty open, but had water hazards in play on most holes. Playing it for the first time was a challenge not knowing where the hazards were. I would play this course again for the right price."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Hawks Tail is a classic design with a good mix of holes. Most were tightish with mature trees guarding the fairways on either side. Some water was in play. The rough had some patchy spots, but otherwise was very thick and lush. Greens rolled true with good speed, and some were very tiny. Rest of the course was in good shape after the rough winter as well."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Overall it's worth a go. Nothing will knock your socks off, but it presents a good challenge."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Loved the layout. Great amenities after the round in the clubhouse. The rough was extremely deep and needed cut. I feel bad for golfers that are high handicappers. The greens were small, fast and excellent but people NEED TO USE DIVOT REPAIR TOOLS!"
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"First, let me warn you that you are not on a service road or a cart path, although the driveway into the clubs seems that way, and watch out for errant tee shots & cart crossings. The course is an interesting layout, and playing the back tees presented demanding par3s #3 & 17. Greens had recently been plugged & top-dressed, but I can't complain because I had <30 total putts. This is not a glitzy course, but certainly fun & well worth the Hot Deal Special."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,really enjoyed playing this course had some challenges which I like and over all a great course to play. I will be playing it again!!!!!!
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Not worth your time or money. There are so many other places to golf in Indiana that are better than Hawks Tail. No matter the business, if you get your stuff stolen from the people that work there its a horrible establishment. Its a direct reflection of how the place is ran."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Really enjoyed the course. Played with my 14 year old daughter and the women's tees were perfectly placed. Teed off at 2:20 and it was really hot, but the water coolers were cold and full. Course force me to use about every club in my bag and I like that!"
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,God cnidarian over all . Greens need attention
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"The staff friendlyness was off the charts, they were super. The course was in great shape for this Time of year and all leaves were either chopped or gone. The course is very fair; with of course some holes more challenging than others. Had a great day. Looking forward to playing there again. Thanks."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Loved the course. Well maintained. Large undulating and fast greens. Would definitely play again. Beautiful scenery.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"First time at Hawks Tail. Excellent fairways tee boxes and greens, fast greens. Friendly staff. Need tee marker at #4, not big deal. Could use map layout of course on scorecard... Minor observations not criticism- overall good value and will play again."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Very well groomed! Kudos to the groundskeeper! The staff is very friendly! We enjoyed our afternoon round!
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"I should have been more prompt with my reviews. I played twice in August..... Two thumbs up. No complaints. Good shot values.... Greens have very little sand in their composition, making divot repair difficult, but greens still rolled quick and true."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"I played as a single on a Tuesday 2:03 tee time. I live in Greenfield and have played the course over 100 times. I love the fast greens and slightly long fairways. The last 3 times, I was unable to finish the last 5 holes due to excruciatingly slow play.This time I got behind a 6 some that was following a 5 some and a 4 some. Hey for $14 with a hot deal, I guess I more than got my money's worth. Be advised that there is a member choose up that starts at 11:00 and they simply don;t care about anyone else on their course."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Booked a tee time on Golf Now. Had a girls high school invitational. Took us 3 hours to play 9 holes!! Had to wait 20 minutes past our tee time for carts. Instead of allowing other tee time should have closed the course for the invitational and rescheduled our tee time. Paid for 18 and only played 9 holes. Would have taken 7 hours to play it all. Other than that awful experience the course was in great shape and it really is a beautiful course. In my opinion the course should not have allowed other tee times. Was not happy.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Greens were too fast. Need watering. I'am already not that good but the greens were crazy.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"A hidden gem in central Indiana. Great mixture of holes, and the course was in great condition. Fair, but penalizes bad shots. I will definitely play it again."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"I love Hawks tail, it's a very nice course. Although, yesterday, (father's day) I paid for a round at this course , which I play at sometimes at least once a week, and u got there and the whole course was practically under water. I saw up to 4 groups of people waiting at tee box's at once. I called golf now, which they called you guys to see how the course was that day. You guys said you shouldn't refund me because the course was playable. Which I understand you can say a course is ""playable"" no matter what unless there is no lightning. So I was forced to play, and I am a very fast golfer, which yesterday it took me 3 hours to play 9 holes, which I just left and didn't finish the 18 holes. I am disappointed."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Fairways were cut just right and lush and thick/seemed like bent grass, but I was told it was something else/greens were in great shape too"
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"any time you&friends can play golf is a good day,the course was in good shape,greens roll true&fast,pace of play was excellent didn't have to wait on tee boxes,it was hot&muggy but they had water coolers on certain holes...over all it was a fun experience...I will go back!!!"
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,My son and I had a great time. Plan to play here again.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"We really enjoyed our round of golf on a beautiful day! The course was in great condition, especially the fairways. We will definitely return to play again! The price was unbelieveable!"
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Awesome experience we will continue to use this service, thank you!"
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"this was the first time I played this course,i didn't shoot well,i don't know if it was me or the rain,but my playing partners and I will play this course again"
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,first four holes were fine get to 5th tee a foursome that was not in front of us says they were sent there by the course manag they held our foursome up plus a twosome behind us and the foursome behind them pretty much ruined the day for all of us the twosome quit after 15 holes this is no way of gaining customers probably will not be back
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"I played the course because the price was right. However, they did not honor the price confirmed to me by Golf Now. The price was supposed to be $25.00 and they charged $28.00. With the on line fee that was paid, it made the total price 30.49."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,This is a good Indiana course. Fairly flat with plenty of trees. Bunkers around the greens which make you hit the greens but typically areas where you can run it up. The strength of the course is its greens! They are fantastic and the reason my group plays there around 10 times a year or more. They are typically slick and roll true with some undulations.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,course was in great shape. has a few holes that you hit between trees to get to the fairway. some water on a few hoes on the front 9 . a good course to play.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Greens were excellent and smooth and made for some tough putting. Right amount of water and bunkers were easy to hit out of
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Course was in great shape. Greens are SMALL. With the wind blowing on the day we played, the greens were REALLY SMALL. Good time was had, and I will return."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Find the fairway on No. 1 or you are in for a long day.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,This course has very slick greens that are a joy to putt on. Some of the best greens around Indianapolis.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Good course. Need to play again to know better where to play certain shots. My only complaint is that the entire course was cart path only. There were only 3 or so holes that needed to be closed down. Someone should go out in the morning and then in the afternoon to assess what areas need to be cart path only. Then put signs up on those holes. I played Martinsville last week and that's what they did and it worked out fine.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,The course is in great condition. The fairways are nice and the greens are well taken care of. The rough is not too tall. The sand traps are good also.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"The course was in great condition. The pro, Mike F was a great host as always. Highly recommend this course!"
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"this course in perfect condition,well taken care of. will definitely play again. pro shop and 19th hole great"
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"I was in town for a wedding and some golf with the family. We teed off at 9:00 am. The course was in amazing condition, very well maintained. This course has many creeks running through it and offers a little challenge in some areas. The staff in the clubhouse and restaurant/bar were very friendly and helpful. The layout can be narrow in places, but makes this course a challenge and is good for a player of any level. We ended up playing 27 holes that day because it was such a nice course and good value for the money. I would recommend this course to everybody looking for a good day on the course and a good challenge, but not overwhelming. It was also great to see they offered golf lessons for groups of very young kids on the driving range and putting green."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"The course itself was in good/excellent condition. However, the facility is not that nice to GolfNow customers. I booked a tee time as a single. I got there about 90 minutes early but the course made me wait for the tee time and pair me up with other GolfNow tee times....even though... THERE WAS NO ONE AHEAD OF ME for a least 45 minutes before I teed off. Add to that...they wouldn't let me pair up with a single who apparently was not a GolfNow tee time. I was NOT pleased by this. Also, as I first got there...a 5-some was teeing off. Now...in my experience...any course that lets a 5-some go is not that concerned about pace of play. I will not be playing the course again anytime soon due to their poor treatment of me."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Long wide open golf course, fairways in excellent condition, greens flat and very fast. It pays to run the ball on to the green unless you can hit it high and soft or can stop it."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Great greens for this time of year. Worth the drive to greenfield.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,The creeks eat a few balls; but otherwise fairways and greens in great shape. No backups or slowdowns on course. Finished 18 holes with three of us just under four hours.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Some of the best greens in the county - true, very fast, and tough to read. Bring your best putting stroke.Play is quick. Patrons and staff are very friendly.The staff may want to think about either putting a course map on the scorecard or putting up a few directional signs between greens and tees. If you are not familiar with the layout it can become confusing where the next hole is... really.On the other side of the coin, I think they do need to cut the fairways shorter - give a good drive a little roll-out to make it a bit more fair on long par 4s."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Immaculate fairways and greens. Nice setting and nice layout.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,The Hawks tail courses visited was very well maintained. It had challenging bunker shots as well as some challenging water shots. It's was a very pleasent course with lots of scenic views I would recommend it to any of my fellow gofers
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,This is a pretty straight forward course. Nothing really special about it. The greens are in good shape and roll fast and true but other than 2 or 3 they are pretty flat with no undulation. Was recommend to this one by some people I have played with in the past and was completely unimpressed. If you live over that way I suppose it is OK to play but I will not be traveling out to Greenfield to play this one again.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Good driving course. Set up for right to left. Not a lot of water hazards.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Course was well maintained. Greens were good and rolled true. Rough was cut but thick. Fairways were great.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Nice mix, lovely relaxing surroundings. Has a good mix of challenges."
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,After the rain we have had the course was damp but playable . The fairways needed mowed and the rough was real tall almost US open tall and thick but with the rain I am sure they could not mow. The biggest problem was they let a group of guys go out in 5 somes ahead of us like 3 of them so the pace of play was very slow over 5 hours for a round of golf. I like the course and was in over all good shape would go back but if pace of play is that slow again will never be back
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,Hit them long and straight! The course was in great shape.
Hawk's Tail of Greenfield,5767-hawk-s-tail-of-greenfield,"Nice practice range (real grass )Nice carts, new electricCourse is in good shape"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Always run into the mature that dosent know to let faster players play through. Not the courses fault, and i like to see new golfers. But without fail i always get stuck behind a mature that wont let people play through. Great people and course"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Good course just pace of play was horrendously slow.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Clubhouse staff was amazing!!!!! The course was obviously busy because of how nice it was outside. But the staff did great juggling carts and handling lines for food. Great job ladies!
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"This is a go to course my family and I enjoy playing. Easy walkable course for those who chose to walk. 2 different 9's. Front 9 flat with very little to challenge your game. The back is a different story where water comes into play on 5 holes i.e. the creek on #10, #11, #17,#18 and fun short par 3 #16 over a pond. Not as easy as one would think.Ower's continue to make enhancements to the course and keep it in good shape. Greens run true, fairway are good Ole fashion bluegrass which to makes for a more natural way to enjoy your round.Would recommend playing because of that and the extremely friendly staff that operate the course. I/we play the course several times a year and always walk away having an enjoyable round."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"I really liked the course, it was in good condition. The tee boxes were in good condition, as were the greens. Back nine is tighter with trees lining both sides. Not a long course, but playing the Blue tees (6000 yds) was challenge enough for first time playing the course. Some of the pin placements made putting a challenge, which was good....just hoping I can read the greens better next time. Scored a 87, didn't manage the back nine very well. Good day overall and will come back to play it soon!"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Great course, the front nine starts out wide open but narrows a bit to prepare you for a tighter back nine."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"I live in Greenfield and Arrowhead Golf Course is hands down, the best golf course around, staff is super helpful, polite, and their hospitality is second to none!!! Pricing is great, food is great, beer is cold!!! The course is always in great condition. This is the course for me, I Love This course, so if you want to play a super nice course then this is the Course!!!Thank you,Ron Davis ( Non Member , but looking to become one."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Nice course, good value, wide open front 9, wooded back 9, relatively short, greens are pretty slow. Staff are all very nice."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Easy course to play. One of my hometown favorites to get some easy golf in. Would recommend anyone to play here.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Passing through and found this course on Golf Now app. For the price it’s a very good deal. The course was in ver my good shape. For a muni course tucked away it’s very good. The staff was friendly and the pace wasn’t bad, the slow group in front let us play through. Would definitely go back."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,greens were slow. fairways did not roll very well and tee boxes not real good.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Course was in good condition, especially considering the rain and storms we've had. The staff is always friendly. Pace of play was rather slow, but it was a holiday. Overall, it was a fun round and we'll be back!"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"After a rainy morning, Arrowhead was one of the only courses open. Staff inside the clubhouse were very friendly. Expected standing water on most of the course due to the amount of rain, but there was no standing water anywhere. Fairways and greens were well kept and even the rough was pleasant to hit out of. All around was a very well kept course. Would definitely play there again."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Nice course. T-boxes and fairways were average. Greens were good. Staff was pleasant.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,We had a great afternoon and brought my 90 yr old dad with to enjoy the warm weather and the beautiful course and leaves! Golf was fabulous and pace of play was very good.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"We walked 18 holes and we loved that. They were airiating the back nine, so we played the front 9 twice. Pace of play was perfect."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Not a bad little course in the country. The Pro Shop staff was terrible. ZERO Personality and just downright rude. Tee boxes were in terrible shape, and they have NO BALL WASHERS ON ENTIRE COURSE. First time I have been to a course and didn't see a single washer! How is that possible? Pace of play was terrible on a Saturday at 9:45. There was a league in front of us, a 2some was the last group, and then a regular foursome in front of us. The 2some took 15 minutes to finish the first hole. needless to say it was backed up all round. Short course that plays somewhat fun if you can drive it long, you can chip it up on many holes. Just need to have a marshal to hurry people along. But a fun little country course."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Went on a Sunday via a Hot Deal. Tournament started right ahead of us, but they spaced them out and we didnt catch up to them till about the turn. Backed-up a little thanks to holes 13 & 15, but cant be mad as it was a Hot Deal and we've paid full price and had rounds take longer."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Good, well taken care of course outside Indy and I look forward to visiting again next season."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,This is my favorite course. I drove 40 miles one way to play.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Enjoyed my round at Arrowhead. Very friendly staff, a nice variety of holes and the course was in incredible shape. Fairways were beautiful and the greens were very smooth. Hidden gem in Hancock County. Will be back soon."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Review1. Staff- Made my fathers day weekend forgot my wallet and help me to find different options on how to pay and got it done. The attitude was u going to golf and you will not miss your Tee Time LOL thanks to the crew in the club house. I couldn’t get the ladies name to mention her thanks and yes my wife came thru with the payment.2. Tee Boxes- All of them where in nice shape great job to the ground crew3. Fairways- They where great and nice length on the rough the ground crew getting all the love in this review3. Greens- All of them where in great conditions once again ground crew looking sharp4. Layout’s- Front nine not to much strategically as far as ball placement until Hole 8 par 5 and Hole 9 Par 4 reachable. The Front is pretty much a go get it how ever make sure you know how much you hit with each club. The Back 9 is totally different ball placement and strategy comes to play with creeks and narrow fairways. If you pull Driver you have to make sure you ready it could be a good or a really bad decision remember ball placement out of the tee and knowing your Iron length will help you if not you will have a rough back 9.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Neat little course out in the country. Fun par 3’s. Greens were decent… fairways and grass cut beautifully, so shout out the grounds crew and super."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Beautiful day for golf. Greens putted true with several pins in difficult spots on the back of green. Great day!
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Always packed and no Marshall to keep the pace of play up
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Booked this course for the first time. Nice course, great value and in good condition. There are scoring opportunities on the back 9 if keep the driver in the bag on some holes. The greens were great shape and putts rolled out. Would recommend this course."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"This is a great course if you’re a new golfer trying to get your feet wet. It wasn’t super busy, the holes were mostly straight and not too narrow. Also not too many water hazards. It’s not super fancy, and is a great place to improve your game."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Wonderful staff and course was in excellent condition. The pace of play was greatly impacted cause b/call the golfers in the area finally came out to play completely understandable. I will like to recommend to make mandatory the pairing of golfers b/c of the high demand helps the flow of the game. The front 9 is great really open great to score and make sure to get them early cause the back 9 is challenging and confirms the name of the course narrow(arrow) window becomes tighter and holes are shorter. I will recommend this place always is a wonderful course
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Played 18 holes in less than 2 hours and 45 minutes today. Normally it’s about 3 - 3 1/2 hours.Course was in good shape at the end of April.Will play here a few times again this year.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Simple, honest golf, good layout and conditioning. No glitz or attitude, just fun."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Played AH several times. Decent course for money, but I’ve had more than one encounter with a rude staff member. I booked a solo tee time. Saturday morning, I FULLY expect and understand being paired with a group. However, I was not only asked to be paired with a group, but I was asked to share a cart with someone. I respectfully said that I wasn’t comfortable with that. She didn’t offer me a raincheck, and then rudely told me that since I booked it on GolfNow there wasn’t anything she could do about it. Overall decent course, but the one rude staff member ruins the whole experience. Done playing Arrowhead."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,I have been playing this course for almost a year from my first time until now I can see a massive improvement!!!! The only thing to complain if there is something is the golf cart needing a upgrade other than that no issues. If you in the area go for it trust is great.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Thus course is a middle length course with the front nine wide open and mush easier then the back nine that is tree lined. Course is easy to make tee times pace of play on 10/8 only took me 3 hrs 10 mins to play. Driving range is restricted to only irons a a small practice putting green. The staff are super friendly, and management continues to make improvements to the course as they have been doing for the past 3 years.Fun course to play to score low and very easy to walk."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,The staff is always friendly and helpful. Pace of play is always excellent.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Weather was bad, rain. When we showed up, she told us that she wouldn't refund our tee time because it was purchased from a 2nd party app. Amd when we decided to play anyways, she looked outside and gave us keys to the 2 worst carts they had available. No shield, dirty, etc. After playing front 9, there was a different person running the shop, and she was nicer. But, they still seem to not feel the need to smile at their guests. Very off puting"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Overall a nice rural golf course. Great rates! The conditions of this golf course have increased greatly over the past two years. The staff in the clubhouse are not always super friendly but they will take care of you. I would recommend playing Arrowhead to anyone.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Arrowhead may fly below the radar a bit, but I’ve been playing this course off and on for over 25 years now and it’s in the best shape it has ever been. Seem to be continuous improvements and additions to the course daily."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Had an 11:50 tee time. Didn’t have a cart available until 12:30. Despite waiting around for 40 minutes, golf was fun once we got out there. Course was in decent shape considering the lack of rain."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Front 9 was flat and straight. Not much personality. The back nine was much more enjoyable. Narrower fairways, large mature trees, some water and sharp doglegs. The pace of play was 2.5 hours a nine. The rate was one of the lowest I have paid in Indiana. I’ll be back due to the value and the back nine."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,This course is 5 minutes from my house so when I saw the tee off deal I was thrilled. Excellent course with perfectly manicured.greens and fairways...the front 9 offers a pretty wide open layout but the back 9Can be more difficult as trees surround the fairways requiring you tokeep in play to have a chance to score wellOverall it's a fun course for beginner to the more advanced golfer.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,It was pretty crowded but was a very cool layout and the course was taken care of very well
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Very fun course, the back 9 was very cool through the woods! Will return for sure."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,I have been playing this course off and on for many years. I can honestly say that the course was in the best condition I’ve ever seen it. The greens were spectacular. This course is a good value.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Course was in great shape. New bridges over creeks, and some drainage upgrades are being made. Arrowhead is one of my favs."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,This is great place for newer players and more casual golfers to learn the game and experience a variety of holes. The front is longer and wide open. The back is super tight and pretty short. It makes for a fun 18 but don't expect a country club experience. Fun for all levels if you know what to expect going in.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Lots of rain night before. It was cart path only. Amazing quality of fairways and greens.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Spring has been tough in Indiana. It was cartpath only. Not a problem if you hit ball to cartpath. Course played great despite rain. Recommend it to all golfers.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Golf for fun not to put on the green jacket kind of course.Most players are polite and not pushy.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Not a lot of hazards at all. The only “hazards” you have to watch out for are hitting a tee shot into the trees and losing your ball that way. The cousss is eaten slay open though and it’s probably my favorite course around and matches my skill level perfectly.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Tee boxes fairways and greens were in great condition the pace today was good under 3 hours great course for the price of golfnow
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Staff friendly and helpful. Front and back nine very different layouts. Front more wide open. Back tighter and requires target golf. Fairways and greens in good shape. Walked it with no issue.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Overall nice course tee boxes could be better greens ok staff friendly
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"It's a short course, but as a novice who can't trust his driver I liked the distance. Short on sand and water but lots of trees, with some dog legs and sloped greens, there were challenges. We started early, so pace was perfect."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Great Course hidden in Greenfield, IN. I play here alot. They have a value card that pays for itself if you want to golf here often. It's taken care of very well, and when it's rough, so what, it was twenty bucks. I've golfed all over Indiana and you don't see a Course like this for 20 bucks. Front nine is open and less challenging, back nine gets considerably harder, especially when the trees are full. Only problem with this place are the neckbeards who frequent it. They don't fix divots, they throw their beer cans on the ground, cigarette butts on every hole, they golf in jeans, play music from their carts, drive up into your tee box and have no sense of golf etiquette at all. If it weren't for the rednecks it would be great. Oh, and if one of you are reading this, you know who you are, go golf at a goat ranch and leave golf to the golfers."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,The greens were in great shape on March 30th. Our foursome played in just under 4 hours. The front nine and back nine are totally different. Had a good time.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Love this course and consider it my home course. While it’s early in the season. Play was very slow group of five in front of me had to ask to pass twice. And the greens are usually great, they where severely pot marked with unfixed divots and rough and bumpy. Have. Hopes they will clean it up. If the play is going to increase at this course as I think it will they are going to have to have a range ranger to monitor play and flow. But opinions are like behinds everyone’s got on and they all stink at some time."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Nice day ,a litttle windy,course was in real good shape,will differentiately play here again"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Course offers low rate on Tee Off and Golf Now then charges $15.00 extra when you arrive for a cart barely able to run. Torn seats, loose steering, no windscreens and bald tires. Most wrecked and slow. ""Cute layout for children or beginners."""
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,I’ve been playing this course for over 20 years I’ve watched it evolve as far as the fairways the drainage. The greens are always in excellent shape. If only the golfers would fix the Divet marks when they hit the green. The work of the greenskeeper and owner of the course is very evident wish there was a way that we could turn it into a par 72 instead of a par 70. Staff are great.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Enjoyed playing Arrowhead, it wasn't super tough but gave us enough challenge to test us. Par 5 on backside was tough, didn't expect the 90 degree left turn and be sure to hit it past trees that line the corner."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"DO NOT PURCHASE A HOT DEAL FROM GOLF NOW!!!!! Golf Now leads you to believe carts are included. NOT THE CASE. When we checked in we were told carts would be $15 per person extra. $30 for two in a cart. Never paid $30 for a cart in over 60 years of playing this game. Due to the Pandemic, the clerk at check in let us each have our won cart, so I applaud her for that. We paid $66 for two players ($36.98 via Golf Now and $30 for carts) Read Golf Now carefully."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,We paid $32 ($16 each) Then we were charged additional $15 each to ride. $62 for my wife and I was no deal for this course.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Course is in good playing condition. When we arrived for our 3:45 PM tee time we were asked to go off the back because they had league play as well as a high school girls match going on. After seven holes the girls who were competing and their parents and coaches appeared and stopped is in our tracks. When we attempted to go to the front nine, we were behind the last group in league play who informed us that they were backed up. We then went back to the clubhouse to request a refund. It was just too much going on. The staff was really friendly and understanding about it."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Arrowhead is a hidden gem of a golf course! I have been playing here for over 15 years and the owner and staff have done an incredible job each season raising the level of this course. At the same time, it is very affordably priced and the layout is one that is both attainable for the lower level player while having its challenges for the more experienced player. If you want to play a fun course while not emptying your wallet, give Arrowhead a try!"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Played in December. Walking 18 for 10 dollars was great value. Fairways and greens were in excellent condition. Played here years ago and course has improved.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,This course is not bad at all for the money. The greens and fairways are nice even in our drought conditions. Pace can be really fast or really slow depending on the day. I once played the front nine by myself in 55 minutes. But sometimes they have outings that really slow you down. Overall a thumbs up. The back nine is more challenging than the front. 17 green breaks a ton to the left if the pin is back.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"After booking the course on GolfNow the week prior, I called to make cart arrangements. I was told I couldn’t reserve two carts since they are on a first come first serve basis, I asked how much the fee for the cart would be and was told is was $15 per cart, so $30 all together. When we got there the woman I spoke to at the front desk was extremely rude and on top of that told us that we had to pay $15 PER PERSON for the carts. Which ended up costing me $60 extra dollars for each of our 4 players. I told her what I was told on the phone a week prior and she would not honor the price they initially gave me. All of this was on top of the fact that we could not tee of until over an hour past our tee-time. The course was beautiful and fun to play but I would never put any more money into this shady business after our experience."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Booked a hot deal like I have several times in the past just to get charged another $30 for a cart that was always included in the past. I have played this course atleast 50 times. Will never play here again.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Went to the course paid our fees nothing due at the course according to Golf Now got to the course went in the clubhouse they said are you riding or walking and we said riding they said that’ll be 30 more dollars I have never ever had this happen to us I will not book on Golf Now at arrowhead ever again call Golf Now they gave us two promo codes which took care of our fees that we had to pay the course Scratch arrowhead from our list
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"It's a great course to play on a budget. The greens are fast and the course is maintained well for what it is. Drainage is an issue after big rains, but that may be the only issue the course has."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Had a good time with my son. His first real round. Some nice fun holes where a beginner might get a par.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"It was raining, lightning and thundering. None condusive to golfing! I've played this course for30 years. First person to play the back nine before it was opened. Mr Oden, the original builder and owner was a good friend of my father. He would not let someone step on the course if there was thunder, let alone lightning. I won't even hit a bucket of balls at that course. I lost my money for my green fees. But I didn't get hit by lightning !"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"It had been thundering and drizzling all morning. I received an email from golf now with a tab that stating ""my event could not launch ""."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Excellent staff, course in good shape. Very enjoyable round."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"I consider Arrowhead my home course. It is usually in good condition and I usually get a good price. It has all that's needed including a driving range in addition to the course, putting green and clubhouse. I don't play as often as I'd like. So I appreciate the open front 9 as a warm up for the more challenging back 9."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Been playing this course for about twenty years. Have seen the course dry out and clean up. Most courses are beat to up by this time of the year. But not this one. Front nine very forgiving back is tighter. Recommend this to all. Staff great. Love the new patio seating area. Would like to see seed and sand repair on carts for repairs.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Course is in good condition. Owner works very hard to provide a very positive golf experience. He does a great job. Just wish the would use the red, white and blue flags on the greens. Red if flag is in front of the green, white for middle and blue for back of green. All in all it's a great value for the money."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"This is a really fun course for golfers of different skill level. I’m closer to the beginner level but still have fun and can continue to grow into this course. It is reasonably priced and well kept. The front nine is wide open while the back nine has more trees so you get good variation. Definitely my favorite course to play in the area, especially when you consider the price."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Enjoyed the time on course. Quiet surroundings and polite golfers that let me play through.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,I've played this course several times over the last few years. It has always been in good shape..even if there has been lots of rain. Everything about the course is generally nice and the staff is always helpful. The carts are always in good shape and clean and they have a nice snack bar and pro shop.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Short but challenging, this course is great for every type of golfer. The maintenance crew has done a great job keeping the fairways and greens in good shape. You won't find a better course for the money nearby."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"I've played this course numerous times over the years. It is usually in good condition. This time was no exception. I was concerned because of all the rain we have had this spring. But I was pleasantly surprised that it was very good for the most part. The staff is always friendly. The carts are new. The greens were in good shape except for one spot on #16. It was busy this day. But we played it in less than 4 hours. Not the greatest course in the area. But pretty good, and well worth the money."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Stumbled upon a great deal at the Arrowhead golf course in Greenfield. The staff were very helpful and welcoming upon our arrival. The course was in good condition considering all the rain over the last few days. Only one or two holes that had soggy areas. The greens were on the slower end but rolled true and several of the pin locations created challenging putts. Overall, the course provided an enjoyable challenge and the conditions were impressive."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"My one recommendation would be to have a course ranger or marshal to keep things moving along. We did notice one foursome on the back nine that had 2-3 empty holes in front of them while numerous groups were piled behind. I think this may be in part to the layout of the course, but a little encouragement could have probably shaved 15-20 minutes off of the other groups' rounds."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Nevertheless, we had a very enjoyable round at a great value. I will definitely be bringing back a friend or two in the future."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Course is in great shape I try to play this golf course And I will play again
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Great condition good course enjoy playing alwaysI am looking forward to playing again I play three or four times a year old records the greens were next to me condition fairways were in excellent addition
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Got a fantastic hot deal through golf now, had never played, didn't know what to expect. The course was in fantastic shape, if there was a ball mark on the greens I didn't see one. Granted it was a day that was supposed to rain, I had the course almost to myself, but I was blown away how well maintained it was, especially considering all the rain we've had lately."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"I have never played a course that was a better value for how nice it was and what I played, I'd pay twice as much just to play it again. Thanks for the great round!"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Great value for the first game of the year. Good weather and a lot of golfers ready to go. Good pace and quick greens. Staff is great.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Friendly staff, as usual. Course was great as usual. Love the layout. Open front 9, challenging back 9. Back 9 will put you to the test. Have to be very straight off the tee or you’ll be scrambling."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"First time playing Arrowhead, and we were very pleased with the value for the cost. We were able to add in an additional cart so our non-playing kids could ride along with us. The very friendly staff didn’t blink an eye to this request. The course was in good shape, wet and mucky in a few spots but that’s to be expected with the last week of rain. No issue with pace of play for a Saturday afternoon. I will definitely return."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,We had a lot of rain the day before course Greeks were overflowing It was cartpath only but what a great course to play it was a beautiful day recommend this course do you anyone that enjoys playing golf
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,This course might have been great except; the fairways were higher than the second cut of rough. It was almost impossible to hit a shot from the fairways to the greens. I won't be playing golf there ever again.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,always a pleasure to play. greens were in good shape and ok as well.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Had a great time playing the course it was in excellent shape the layout is great can’t wait to go back
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"I've played this course many times. It's a good deal for the money, especially if you go thru the week with a GolfNow ""hotdeal"". The front side is pretty easy. The back side not so much if you can't hit it straight down the fairway. Lots of trees on the back side. And several of the holes are always ""cart path only"" because of the constant shade. Not fun if you hit your drive to the wrong side of the fairway. Usually this course is in good shape. This time, I would say some of the fairways had a lot of dead grass. But the greens were good. And the tee boxes were pretty good shape. And where the grass was not dead, the fairways were in good condition."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,I am 72 but I still play the regular tees. The course is pleasant to play. Course is not long but still has some challenging holes. The staff is super. Some of the greens are difficult to putt but fair. I enjoy playing here. It is a great value for the cost.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Arrowhead continues to improve on a yearly basis, the greens are in the best shape theyve ever been in. The course has a great blend of holes to attack and holes where you need to plan your attack. A very playable course that rewards you with good scores if youre on your game and play smart. The front nine is challenging, but more openthan the wooded back nine, although there are multiple holes where out of bounds can come into play. A great course for all ages, with multiple tee boxes. As a somewhat regular at Arrowhead, I would find it hard to believe someone could come out and not enjoy the course."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,My good friend and I had a very enjoyable round and look forward to the next time we can play this very nice course!
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"I enjoy playing this course, and don’t mind the nearly 30 mike drive from Greenwood. Sometimes, and this can happen at any course, someone will cause a backup. On Saturday this happened with a threesome, and it caused major issues on the back 9. It would have been a much better round if they knew to let people play through. Anyway, I almos always have a great time playing golf here, and would most definitely recommend to friends!!"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Back nine is great! Mostly open course. Will be back soon.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"First time playing here and was surprised how great the course was in, especially with the heat and lack of rain. Great course and not too hard for newer golfers. Only issue was that my cart died on hole seven but the pro shop quickly sent someone out to replace it"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,I am 71 but I play from the regular tees. This course is playable by me. There are some easier holes and some more difficult. The pins can be placed in very difficult position which make the easy holes hard.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,I always enjoy Arrowhead as it is a reasonable course for me to play. I am 71 but still play from the regular tees. There are some difficult and challenging holes but it is still playable!
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"I played with 2 of my buddies, and we were impressed with the course from the moment we arrived. The clubhouse staff was very friendly, and the facilities, carts and the course were clean and well-maintained. We loved the picturesque layout of the course, as well. We would love to come back in the Spring or Summer when we don't have to deal with the fallen leaves. I would highly recommend this course."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Do you like fairways that are full of bare ruts and giant brown/mud patches?
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Do you like people wearing a t-shirt and jeans hitting into you all round and never yelling ""fore"" or apologizing?"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Do you like holes that make absolutely no sense in their layout?
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"If so, this is the course for you."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Otherwise, spend time, money, and your sanity elsewhere. If you do come here because it's cheap or you got lost and you're close by, it's perpetually winter rules given the awful conditions of the fairways. The front 9 is scoreable but the back 9 is just dumb. 15 is one of the worst designed holes I've ever played anywhere. Nothing like hitting a nice drive on a par 5, then hitting a 75 yard pitch shot from/to the fairway just to have a clear shot to the green. Absolutely stupid."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,My wife and I have been members for five years and we love going to Arrowhead to play. The owners take very good care of the course. The staff are hard working people that are very helpful. The course is challenging and fun. We know you would enjoy playing this course.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Course was in good shape. Greens were pretty quick but rolled really well. No complaints here
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"First time on the course, threesome, my brother and a daughters boy friend. Approximately 30 minute drive to the course for me, longer for the other two.Enjoyed the round. Nice weather. Lost my usual two balls.The driving range, mostly tall grass to hit out of and practice Tee, really small, left a little to be desired.I thought the price for such a small bucket of balls was a little pricey as well.Yes I would play it again, but not sure about the other two."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Not the best course, not the worse course, but a fun and manageable course to play. Front 9 wide open, back 9 fairly tight. Course is always in fair condition."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Enjoyed our round at Arrowhead. The staff were very friendly, had a nice little clubhouse, and the pace of play was good. The course was in pretty good shape, greens were a little slick and there were a couple of washed out fairways from the wet year we've had but overall very playable. The course had an interesting layout with holes that challenge low handicappers to be aggressive with some short par4's and 5's, but not overly difficult for beginners. I will definitely be back and reccomend it to friends."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"If you're looking for a place in Central Indiana to golf, this is the place. From the friendly staff to the well-maintained and challenging course, this place is great for golfers of any caliber. Trees everywhere, but few bunkers. Short and narrow, great for the accurate golfer"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Drove out expecting to play a decent track... found an AMAZING course in FANTASTIC shape. I'm a scratch player myself and my standard are high when traveling to different places. I found nothing but perfect greens, plush fairways and boxes, and a super friendly staff inside and out. I've recommended plenty of people since then who obviously haven't been out to Arrowhead lately.Keep up the great work y'all !!"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,We had a great day of golf even though we missed too many putts! It was in good shape and I would recommend the course.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"The amenities and the location of this course is tough, but everything else was fine. Good condition & nice staff."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Arrowhead is two courses in one. The front 9 is open and easy, yet fun to play. The back 9 is tight with lots of chances to lose balls in the trees. The greens were a little slow. But not bad. The most annoying thing about Arrowhead is that several holes such as 12 and 13 are par 4s with cart path only restrictions all the time. That's pretty annoying when you hit to the opposite side of the fairway from the cart path. Other than that, it's a great place to spend four hours in nature."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"The map provided in the golfnow app sent me to an undeveloped housing development. It was about 15 minutes away from the actual course. The course itself was in real nice shape, in spite of all the rain and flooding the area has had. It's a fun little course with some tricky holes. I'll be back to play again."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"April 10th was the first time I had played there, was pleasantly surprised. Course was well maintained staff was very nice. The first 9 holes was wide open and fun and the 10through 18 was a challenge at one time I felt like I was in a pinball game because my ball would bounce off the trees. Great place 13 dollars hot deal for each of us, was a great day to be on the course"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"This place is fantastic! Super inexpensive but a true diamond in the rough so to speak. Out in the country surrounded by a low key subdivision and cornfields, there are a couple holes on the back nine that are completely secluded. Friendly staff and cheap beer!"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,The greens were unputtable due to recent aeration. Its an ok course otherwise
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"The Course was hard to find due to poor signage. The layout of the course was some what interesting however the condition of the tee's and fairways were well below par, We were warned that over seeding had taken place and that we would roll the ball."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Very muddy fairways with little grass and traps that were not taken care of made our round of golf disappointing.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,My hat is off to the greens keeper. Greens were in grate shape!
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,May try again next year.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Respectfully
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,I had time for a quick round so my wife came and drove cart while I played by myself. It was a pleasant day for us. We both had fun. I am 70 and this course is playable from me from any of the tees. I never use senior tees. The staff are always friendly. I try to play here about three times a month. Sometimes I play 36. The wet weather hurt a couple of fairways but I just moved the ball. This was my wife's first time coming with me and now she will do it more often!
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,The course had fairway damage in many places due to the rain we have received and an excessive amount of crabgrass. The layout was a little different especially the front nine.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Arrowhead is in good shape, and is fun to play."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Spacious front nine fun to let out the driver as the round goes tonthe backnine the course is a bit tighter but nice shade and some fun.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Great value! Course was in great shape. Greens were slow, but in good condition. Front nine was pretty open, and back was a nice tree lined course. Pace of play was slow, had to wait on tee boxes and fairways, but apparently there was a men's league playing."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,it's a nice course I go there often because it is nearby
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"I come to this course quite often to get away from the big city chaos...I truly enjoy playing here....Heather, along with all the staff makes this little golf course in the country most enjoyable! It's worth the drive!!!"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Course is pretty bland old school design. Open on the front, tight on the back. Conditions left a lot to be desired, especially not he greens which putted like 1970s shag carpet. While it may be cheap on here, I would not say it's worth a ride unless you're really local to it."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Great value for the money. Played really quickly, 2hours and 30 minutes for 18 holes. Nice course, back 9 is tough compared to the front. Pretty challenging considering the yardage from tips is only 5600."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,This course is a great course to play. Front 9 are fairly easy and the back nine gets tight with the woods. Overall a great play. Shot a 81 and was pleased with it.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Somehow our T time did not show up in their system, but after showing the conformation e-mail all was good. They had an outing and were booked solid , but Charles came to the rescue and let us go off on 10th tee. Our 2some cruised thru in 3 hrs and 15 min. Thanks again to the counter lady and Charles for making what could have been a bad experience turn out so great :)"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"This course is a good value at everyday prices but the ""Hot Deal"" on golf now made this an outstanding value."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"This course lends itself to amateur players, as well as more seasoned players. Fairways are in good shape, and the tee boxes are cramped but well maintained. The course is challenging and tighter on the Back nine . The Greens are challenging but need better care.Overall a good Course but a bit overpriced."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Due to heavy rains the back nine was closed so we had to play the front twice. This slowed up play due to players returning after nine to play the front again. The course was wet with casual water everywhere. Carts were required to remain on the cart paths. Lay out is o.k. on front, I think based on previously playing the back that it had a better layout."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"This wasn't the first time I have played here, but it has been a couple of years. The course is a good fast track. It also allows you to work heavily on your short game as the length isn't intimidating at all. The course was in A-1 condition and for 10 dollars a person to play, what a steal. Played with two other people, one being a ten year old and from front door to finish it took a little under three hours!"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"The 18 holes provide a great bit of variety. Many doglegs, some elevated tees, and fairways that range from wide to not so wide (nothing real narrow). There is enough water and bunkers to make things interesting but not difficult. The course is tucked away and may be difficult to find without GPS. For some reason, there's not a lot of parking and I did not sample the food. Beautiful course."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"first time playing and certainly will not be the last either. Played Sunday mid afternoon and got a good deal via Golf Now. Course is very well kept, especially the fairways. Interesting contrast between the wide open front nine and the narrow, tree-lined back nine. Pace of play was alright, but with the short course and holes pretty close to one another a slow group can easily make it a long day for others.. Id say it's a good course for golfers of all abilities and I would recommend others to check it out."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Course was nice, but there was no water in any of the coolers. Staff was ok not very quick to help you but I would go back to golf."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"First time but not last! Course was in excellent condition and obviously well cared for. Constantlymowed, greens clean and in great shape. Enoughlevels of difficulty to be challenging but lots of room for error on most holes. Great course for average golfer; probably not as challenging for good players.Great value for price. Will definitely return."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,I am pretty much a beginner and the course was great for me.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Very slow pace. Apparently overbooked the course. The course however was in very good shape with a friendly staff. Tee times do need be spaced correctly.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Pretty Good. Staff was cordial. Gave us a bucket of balls while we awaited a cart.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Hit the driver straight and you will use a lot of short irons.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Played before, course needs to space out starting times but other than slow play was a good experience"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Great couse open front nine wooden back, not overly difficult on the short Sid at 6000 yards hitting from the tips, staff is very accommodating and course is in great shape!"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"I hadn't played this course for a good 12 yrs. Seems like the course is in better shape than I recall. However, when the leaves begin to fall, I can see the back nine being a hard place to find your ball."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,me and my brother played 27 holes and we couldn't have asked for a better day. the golf course wasnt overcrowded and the customer service was amazing I will definitely be going back to Arrowhead again soon!
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Shorter course. The back 9 is mostly wooded which makes some of the fairways tight. Hole 4 is only 85 yard par 3. Great fun though. I have easily played this course over 30 times. Not too challenging. The front 9 is completely open. I still love this course though and it is is better shape now than it was earlier in the year. They finally got rid of all the fairway weeds.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,This course is worth the money....the staff keeps it very maintained!
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Got on for $15 to play 18 with a cart! Golf, beer and a good time! Ran into a single player and he joined up and found a new golf partner! Good day, thank you golf now!"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"This was my first time playing this course and it was an awesome experience. The front nine was open with some of the nicest greens I have seen this year and then came the back with the tree lined fairways. Although I didn't play well, that was more with being unfamiliar with the course. I can't wait to go back. My only complaint is for whatever reason my reservation didn't register in their system. I think that is a golfnow problem as they told me the same issues happened the week before."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"The course was in beautiful shape the greens were fast and well maintained. The staff was friendly and accommodating, good hot dogs and the pace of play was perfect. My group was a two-some and it took us 3 hours from start to finish. I would recommend this course for a nice relaxing morning or afternoon round of golf."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,For early spring this course is in great shape even after some heavy spring rain. I look forward to many more rounds of golf here this season. I also enjoy the friendly and courteous staff. This course offers seniors such as myself a great experience every time I play here. I will continue to recommend this course to my friends and invite them to join me anytime for a round of golf at Arrowhead.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Most notably, the greens are rolling better than ever. I used to always have to think about speed, due to the greens being a little slow, now the greens are a little faster and are perfect. I love playing here, the staff is always very friendly and courteous."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"The front 9 is pretty wide open and the back much tighter and tree lined. A test for any skill level. The course may be a little short for the long bombers, but the short game will get a good workout. A thoroughly enjoying experience."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,I play this course alot and the staff are awsome. The course is not to hard and is in great condition.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"This course has some cool features. The back 9 is gorgeous and they have some cool looking water hazards around some of the greens. This course isn't a typical family owned hacker course. It is well kept, and fun to play as it has some challenging dog legs and elevation changes. The rate of play was very slow, but it had rained at the beginning of my round, so I think that affected the speed of play. All in all, I was impressed with the course for the price. I paid $60 for a foursome with 18/cart. I would say that is a HECK of a deal, especially on the weekend. Considering the ""Golf Now"" prices, I would be happy to pay $30 to play this course."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Very challenging doglegs.. Fairly maintained but slow greens.. But terribly maintained fairways..almost impossible to hit good iron shots
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"This course was very enjoyable to play with its moderately rolling hills and water hazards. The greens were damp and slow in the late morning. Then, as they dried out in the afternoon, they got faster. The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable of the course. I will continue to go to this course."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"The front 9 is pretty open, the back 9 is more wooded & narrow. This is a great course for someone who is just starting out. Course is in great shape."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"The course has a quiet, rural and relaxed setting. It plays very open, but combines water, wooded areas, and dog legs nicely; especially on the back nine. Great place for tuning up your game and for developing players to learn. The most friendly patrons I've ever come across during the rounds I've played. The facilities are basic, so if you need the country club 'vibe', look elsewhere. If you want a pleasant and relaxing round of golf, I suggest tou put this course on your list!"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Course is in pretty good shape! The front was pretty open, not much trouble. The back side was very fun and challenging."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"The back nine is quiet and less crowded than the front, you will also have a chance to see some turtles along the creek that winds through the course"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"Arrowhead is a well maintained course. It is short but it is exciting. The front nine allows you to take control of your game, it helps build your confidence before you enter the back nine. The back nine is the real challenge. Your game must be straight, if not your ball will sound like a pinball game in the trees that line almost all of the fairways. Overall I love this course. It suits my short game. I play here 3 or 4 times a year and enjoy every minute of it."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"This course does require a little bit of a drive if you live in the Indianapolis area, but it is worth it. It is nicely developed with some relatively easy open holes on the front 9, and then a bit more of a challenge on the back with tighter tree lined fairways and elevation changes. Course is never packed and so pace of play is always nice. They have a nice clubhouse with a snack bar serving a variety of sandwiches, hot dogs, candy and beverages from sports drinks to soda to beer, both import and domestics. Overall a good track for an average price. Even better if you get a tee time here on Golfnow.com and they have a Hot Deal. Then it becomes a good track for a great price!"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"This course is in great shape. It has fully recovered from the drought conditions we had the last couple of years. Fairways, greens are very good. The rough is uniform and long enough to make you want to avoid it."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,A very enjoyable course.
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Great course to play & friendly staff. The course is in great shape!
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"The front and back nines allow for two different styles of golf. The course was in good condition, allowed for a more aggressive play. Would definitely go back."
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"front is open, easy par 3s. back is tight and more of a challenge"
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,Got a great golfnow rate for this course... and it did not dissappoint. Enjoyable Sunday round. Course is in pretty good shape considering the long winter!
Arrowhead Golf Course,5766-arrowhead-golf-course,"This course is average and makes for an enjoyable confidence booster. Some of the fairways were not mowed and a few of the greens were hairy and slow. It's a pretty straight-forward layout with the exception of the par 5 on the back nine. If you've never played it you really have no idea how to play the hole. After you play it, you say to yourself ""If I would have known that it would have been much easier."" It's an ok course to play if you can't get a tee time anywhere else. The practice range wasn't really worth using as the balls were in poor condition. It wasn't very busy so we were able to play in under 4 hours."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,greens were a little slow. overall conditions ok until up around q8th green where the last impression you have is not a good one. water main leakage?
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"The greens were shaggy and slow and there was no fringe. The staff is always friendly and it is a fair and fun layout. The rough was thick and long but fair. It is fall, so leaves were definitely an issue when searching for a ball in the rough. Very good value on golf now! Too bad it is a long drive from Brownsburg or we would be out more than twice a year. Thx to everyone on the staff! Check-in was friendly, individual from grounds crew working on tee boxes thanked us from coming, and the young lady working the at the bar/food area was great!"
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"When we were walking in, a gentleman stopped us and thanked us for playing there today. FIRST time this has ever happened at ANY course we have played!This course was amazing. We had such a good time. It was a fairly challenging course and in pretty good shape. The staff was helpful and friendly. Overall, I would DEFINITELY recommend playing here."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Liked everything about the course except the fact that it was difficult to find the back nine
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,from teebox to fairway to greens course in good shape. kudos for new carts with GPS. o ly drawback is rough cartpaths.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Consistent and fast greens, challenging layout and risk/reward decisions on most holes make this course a fun test of your golf game."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Back nine was closed for some reason, so I only played front nine. Seemed decent though."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Was disappointed to find out once we had already purchased the tee time that the back nine was closed for aeration and top coating.Feel we got kinda cheated.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Great course, super nice owner, and an incredible bourbon bar too!"
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Fun course with a friendly staff. Greens on the back were slower but rolled well for March! I really wish there were more fairway yardage markers and simple green sheets for depth and width.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,This course was welcoming as soon as you walked in. All the staff were friendly and answered any questions. It was a soggy day but still good course.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"This was a fun course to play in. It was challenging but to too hard. The course was in great shape, the staff was super friendly and the pace of play was great. Definitely would love to play here again."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,The course was in perfect condition and it makes you think out there. It’s challenging at times with a few shots that are elevated. One of the best local places for your buck!
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"The course is very nice, great value and well kept. Staff friendly also. My one gripe is the back nine could use some more signage marking where it is as it’s tricky to find if it’s your first time here."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Priced right, great layout, great food and bar! Pace of play is often slow. If you have the time and patience for 4h45 round…Great course!"
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Cart paths are rough mostly gravel but no biggie in my opinion had a really good time some weird Hazzard placement but it definitely keeps you on your toes not to mention getting to sit down after the round at the club house and have some awesome BBQ!
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Stop to play 18 holes as I was passing through this area incincredibly beautifulvery Fair course I will come back and play It again
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Super friendly staff. Fun/tucked pin locations. A little disappointed that they’ve already moved to temporary tees this early, but at least they’re taking care of the course. Greens were a lot more playable than my last time out a few months back."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Course was in great shape. It had been aerated and top dressed. Greens rolled true and enjoyed putting.on them. Love to play it again!!
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Like this course but it appeared the greens hadn't been mowed in a while and were really slow. The fairways were a bit shaggy too. Its a nice layout and with various length tees you can get all you wish. The gas carts are a bit old and there is some difficulty getting the brake to stay in the depressed position. That all being said, depending on what you pay, its a good golf experience. They have a senior discount rate M-F of only $28"
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Probably the worst I’ve ever seen the greens at Foxcliff. Very inconsistent speeds and bumps/spike marks everywhere. Was like putting on broccoli.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Course conditions were okay, greens were good, hazards were poor and not particularly located well. Cart path was a complete disaster, not a single foot that was anything but gravel. Certainly not the quality of a country club."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Every hole is different, great layout. Greens are couples, in great shape, and a real challenge."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"We decided to check out this place based on the mostly positive reviews. Overall we liked the course, but the greens were like putting on VELCRO, hard to even get downhill putts to the hole. I know a lot of public courses have slower greens but these were PAINFULLY slow. You should not have to feel like you have to pound a putt to get it to roll. If it weren't for that we would probably come back."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,I play here a at least 2-3 times a year. Worth the 35 minute drive for a change of scenery. Above average layout with a decent variety of holes. New owners have really turned the place around.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Course was on top condition ! Greens were smooth and very fast. They are working on the cart paths butnot a big deal. The pro is always very friendly.The layout is good.I will play again.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Very nice course. Owners are in the process of re-doing the cart paths, but still in good shape. ALL staff was very friendly and helpful. If you haven’t been there, check it out. I will definitely be back."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"The pro shop staff was amazing and welcoming. The barbecue restaurant on site served us an amazing and quick lunch at the turn. Overall, this was a great experience. Thank you."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"It was great to get out of Indy for some golf that wasn't so slow. The course is in good shape. The staff is helpful and welcoming. I'll be back, for sure."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Played the whites. Course in good shape except for 18th green (it needs to be blown off - tree debris). Friendly, helpful staff — fellow golfers allowed me to play thru as a single — very courteous."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,course in good shape from tee to greens. noticeable improvement in golf carts and work on improved cart paths.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Love this course. Very scenic, challenging but not impossible. Play the right tees and hit the ball well for good scores. Great value. I’ll play again soon."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Muddy and winding day good time playing in February
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Nice course, good pace of play. A little bit “spaced out” and could do with some more signs to direct you around , particularly from 9 to 10 and 16 to 17 but overall very happy. Super nice staff."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Foxcliff is located in the middle-of-an upscale housing development. The course itself is okay. Water hazards are ridiculously placed, and those that are in play are mostly dry. Greens were okay, as were fairways. Cart path is a joke, and was the worst path of any course I've ever played. So many potholes, not an inch of paved path. Absurd that thisnplace bills itself as a country club."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"I don’t mean to be too hard on this course but for some reason the course itself didn’t do it for me. Granted, I also played poorly so let that factor into this also.The course rating I gave also had nothing to do with the price, or the staff, or the conditions. Those were fine and I have no complaints there. My only complaint was that the course just had a lack of excitement for me. The par 3s were incredibly boring and offered no risk/reward. The par 4s were a decent mixture of some short and some long, but really just 4 hours after my round they seem very plain without many memorable holes or shots. The par 5s felt like holes they just needed par 5s on to either get back to the clubhouse or because a typical scorecard has 4 par 5s. The land the course lays on was pretty boring besides where some of the nice houses are. Felt like they chose the good land for the houses and squeezed in a golf course wherever they could. I’m no architecture snob but the course was just boring and forgettable.Now with that said, the price was fair and conditions were good. The pace of play was good and the staff was great. Just kind of had a day out there where I wasn’t too excited about the golf.Also worth noting that it was a holiday weekend and the pin placements were kind of boring. Felt like there could be some pin placements to add a little excitement around the greens but I understand the playability factor on one of the busiest weekends of the year.Lastly, the bunkers are a joke here. They should just get rid of them. Having bunkers just to have bunkers is so weird to me.Worth the visit but I wouldn’t go back."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,We enjoyed our round. The course was in good shape. Food at the turn was delicious. Pace of play was smooth.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Priced right, great food and bar. Course is challenging and priced right."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Course was in great shape all year. They are currently putting in new cart paths. Staff was great. I really like this course!
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,greens rolling were rolling well. fairways rolling. course in real good condition.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Course was in great shape as well as the greens. The staff and food was Awesome!!
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Love the course and the staffHighly recommend and will definitely be back
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,My wife and I have played here twice now. They keep insisting to pair us with someone. The people we were paired with were inconsiderate jerks! It completely RUINED our day! Could not enjoy our time out together.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"The course is in great shape. The layout is fantastic. Love this course. The staff isn’t the best, but it’s small town Indiana so I’m guessing their friendliness is based on if you’re a local/member. But the course is great and I’ll be back for sure!"
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,greens were slower than 2 weeks ago. fairways showing some damage due to heat. course still in fairly good shape but needs relief from excessive heat.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,The fairway and greens were in excellent condition. The course layout was fun and beautiful as it ran through the neighborhoods. The cart path was crumbling with grass growing through cracks. It was easier to ride parallel to the path than it was to try to drive on the path.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"The course itself is pretty much straight ahead of you , greens were soft for a 93 degree day . The fairways were in good shape , not a ton of divots that weren’t filled in or need repair . I played it from the blues and it plays a bit longer than the yardage says but it keeps it interesting ! The green speeds were slow and were tricky to putt on ! Overall great price and worth the trip to play !! Had a good time and will be going back sometime soon I hope"
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,It has been over 10 years since I last played this course. Pace was slow due to a family outing in front of us which lucky for us only played 9. Pace was quick after that. The course was in great shape for the first of July. Greens were damp and slow with a lot of break. Nice course in the middle of the woods.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Super friendly people. They were very genuine and helpful. Course is fun and their bourbon bar and BBQ are top notch. Definitely worth the drive. We will be back!!!
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Played here on a busy weekend and thank god the weather and the course were worth it. Had some initial frustrations as we showed up 40 minutes before tee time and were promptly told they were ""out of golf carts"" and then found out groups were running 20-30 minutes behind teeing off due to this. Decided to get a drink at the bar (They have a fantastic whiskey collection) which helped kill some time. Ended up teeing off about 20 minutes behind schedule but it worked out. This course is beautiful and a real challenge. Will definitely play again... let's hope they have carts this time!"
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,I’ve always liked the layout at Foxcliff and I try to play here at least once a year. They definitely have it in a lot better shape than years past. Also a much friendlier staff this time around with the new owners. I would have given them a higher rating if we were able to order any food/drinks. The gentlemen that checked us in stated that they still weren’t “fully open” and informed us we wouldn’t be able to order any food/drinks. I found this odd since they took over in December and it’s mid-May now (aka prime golf season around here).
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Due to weather conditions the course was a little out of shape, not there fault. The tee box markers were a little hard to see due to medium to high grass, but was explained to me before playing.Spoke with a couple members here and was told they have great bbq, my wife and I are going to try.Definitely going back when weather gets warmer. And yes they did accept my hot deal on golf now!"
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Had a great time and will definitely come backHighly recommend abba at golf now rate well worth It
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"The course fun, challenging,and in nice shape. I will definitely return."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,I prepaid thru GolfNow only to have a downpour start just before we arrived for our tee time. Once the rain stopped and the pro assessed the conditions they let us play after moving pin locations on a couple of greens. Course conditions were very good considering the rain that had just occurred.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,I can find nothing but pleasure with this course. The cart paths are rough but the playable areas are more than enough to make up for that. Take a stroll in the art and enjoy the course and wildlife…..one of my best experiences……I already made this a destination course…..it was that enjoyable
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,greens rooted well although not overly quick. fairways rolled and while rough not heavy you were penalized when finding same. thought overall condition of course was as good as I have seen in past several years. Amount of renovation in clubhouse was remarkable. Enjoyed pulled pork and baked beans on the turn. Kudos to maintenance team.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Course was in pretty good shape all and all, but the new owners really sealed the deal for our group. Super friendly, approached us in the club house and thanked us for playing. Top notch service."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Looked like a BBQ spot inside the clubhouse as well. Smelled good, but after playing a round in 96 degree weather, I did not want anything hot to eat!"
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Great price, great service, great layout, and in pretty decent shape."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Course has a great front 9 and an OK back 9 that is half.a mile walk from the 9th green. Conditions were very good , staff very friendly! I really enjoyed the older front 9, back 9 was god, but lacking character."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Didn’t get to play. Booked a T Time the day before to wake up and drive an hour and a half away to get told that they no longer honor golf now and I couldn’t get in today even if I paid there regular rates. I asked about refunding my money since I had paid online the day before and was told I need to take it up with Golf Now. Very unhappy and disappointing experience.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,So i get there a little early and there was a friendly girl working me i tell her my check in time she told me she could get me out earlier if i wanted so i said sure. But then the owner walks out and she tells him i went through golf now and he just got hostile. Telling me he will not accept me on the course if i go through them again and just had this attitude and was like we have shot guns going off left and right so u need to do the back nine now and I’m like my tee time is like in 45 min. I’m thinking to myself why would u have tee times open on golf now if you got shot guns and outings going on. Also i go through golf now to try new courses to see if i want to come back def won’t be coming back now. The course was decent so i can’t complain about that but geeze.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,This is one if the best manicured courses I've played within 60 minutes of me. From tee to green it was actual grass and not weeds mowed to golf course specs.Unfortunately the course says they have ended their business relationship with GolfNow and aren't responsible for bookings done through GolfNow.com. The gentlemen in the pro shop were very professional and found a spot for me even though they weren't required to.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Pros:Course very greenFairways very goodGreens very good, most very undulatingGood mix of holes and elevationsCons:Greens need cutBunkers unplayable or need sandCart paths roughNot a walking course"
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Another great round of golf at Foxcliff. This is my favorite course this year. Just discovered it this year. Maybe been here 8 times. Great friendly staff. Friendly golfers as well. Course conditions are great. Tee boxes and greens are good. Worth the drive to norhern Martinsville.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,New to the Bloomington area and got a great deal to play here. The course plays pretty long if they have watered it recently. I played just after the sprinklers had been turned off and a couple of my tee shots literally sank into the fairway. Rough off the fairway is thick. Greens were nice. I definitely will be going back.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Apparently the management at Foxcliff must be unaware of the Covid-19 protection guidelines.Zero steps were taking place, no masks in shop, no apparent cleaning of carts, no protections at the flagstick, Water available on the course. Business as usual, play at your own risk."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,A beautiful day and nice to play a golf course I hadn’t played in 20 plus years.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Played in 3 hours and 20 minutes. Greens were in great shape and look forward to coming back soon.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"The golf course has some new faces and unfortunately they are treating people as ""outsiders"" or even those who aren't good enough for the course. Staff referred to GolfNow patrons in a negative manner. Other maintenance staff is new and it is showing significantly. Lots of pebbles/sand on the greens from the new holes cut and from the old one being refilled. Tee boxes and other areas of the golf course upon being mowed are left with lots of clippings, which doesn't present well for a golf course."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Course was great. I understand vivid-19 restrictions but put some flags in the hole . Staff was issue. Made my party of 2 feel like it was our fault that Golfnow didn’t communicate with the course that we booked a tee time. Another group of 2 had the same issue and was treated the same. If you don’t like golfnow don’t allow golfnow to book your tee times It seemed like we were the issue and not welcomed
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,We had a great time playing here. Our first time at this course. Front nine seems short. That is not a complaint.The temptation to pull driver is always there even if it is not the smart play. Greens are challenging with slope and difficult to read for pace.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,It was a nice change of scenery. A beautiful area for sure.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Foxcliffe used to be a great course, beautiful layout, tight fairways, nice terrain. All of that still holds, but the cart path is a joke and needs to be replaced. Greens are jumpy, fairways are okay (but it's early in the season). They've really let this place get run down. Too bad."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Cliff is such a Fox.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Booked a tee time and so did 3 other people and no one was there. Not one employee showed up. Now I'm out money because of it.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Booked on GolfNow, was told as soon as I walked in the door that they weren’t accepting GolfNow scheduling but we were allowed to play. Pretty much saying you can play today but don’t come back. Carts are slow, Leaves on fairways make it impossible to find your shots, Rough Cart Path, and so on...."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Drove to the course and no one was there. No one was working. Was not able to play wasted my time and money
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Course was closed !Took 35 minutes to get there !Had to find another course to play
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Very friendly staff, course is in good condition at this time of the year. Had lots of fun today!"
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Course was in excellent condition for this time of the year....Tee boxes were great ...greens were some of the best I've played in my 40+ rounds this year....
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"I played here once three years ago and had a great experience. I’ll be returning far sooner for my next round, for sure. Layout is good, course condition is good, staff is friendly and cost is very reasonable. Has enough difficulty to challenge a better player but very playable for a high handicapper as well....doesn’t beat you up if you’re not having your best day. Definitely recommend and look forward to playing again soon."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Had great time, staff was great, if had more time in the area would play again"
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"I used to play this course as my go to almost every weekend, as it is between Bloomington and Indy (where most of my golfing buddies live)"
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Last year I booked a tee time at the course, arrived there that morning after driving 40 mins to the pro shop telling me that from the rain the night before the course was closed. The shop never called me to tell me it was closed and let me drive all the way there instead. Slightly annoyed I said okay then, how will I get my money back? They said to call golf now and golf now would confirm that they were closed and refund my money... no problem got my money back and went to bluff creek."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Fast forward to this April. I prepaid a tee time and the morning of it rained way more than it did last year... assuming they would close I called the course to see if they were open. The young man at the pro shop said, “well, we got a lot of rain, no way we will be open later... cancel your tee time”. So I did... and when golf now called they said that they had stayed open. Because of this I was out my $80. Golfnow gave me $100 in $20off coupons that can only be used Monday-Thursday (LOL I work Monday through Thursday). The pro shop blew me off when I emailed them also."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Refusing to play there again, I got a call a month ago to my friend who had free passes. I decided to go play on the free pass. Was a super slow day with slow foursomes in front and behind us hitting in to us, happens on days as nice as this Friday was. On the 16th green a worker approached me and asked for a ride to the maintenance shack because his mower broke down, no one was answering the phone, and he didn’t want to walk. I said, uh, are you serious? I have a foursome playing in to us? He said yeah, it would really help me out. So I asked where the maintenance shed was, he respond “by the 10th hole”. Not too far away so I decide to drive him. In the middle of my round I drive this guy to the 10th hole... a good 3/4 min drive. We get there and i say, sooo where is it again? He then says, we’ll it’s actually by the clubhouse..... which is through a neighborhood another 3/4 mins away. Called the club house on my way back to 17 to let them know what happened and offered no solution."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Literally can’t make this stuff up. Go to eagle pines, bluff creek, or martinsville instead."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"I. Booked this with Golf Now ....I drove an hour to get there and my friends drove over that to meet me. Upon arrival we were greeted with a ""course closed"" sign. The. Corse may be nice, the reviews are based on the fact that someone should have e known the course was not opened yet this year before it was posted on Hot Deals.The company did reimburse us for the round. I called numerous times to see if we could tee off earlier but no answer, should have been a clue. I thought they were just busy with other players.Dont usually post negative stuff but beware fellow golfers."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,The course was in good shape although a little soft from recent rain. It was an unusually warm day for late November 60. All the holes on the front nine had water in them so we had a ball wash on each hole. We had a good time and the pace was at our own speed no one ahead and a few behind. Is fall so you have to deal with leaves blowing around the course and at times it is a challenge to find your ball. Overall it was great to get in a late round of golf this far north.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Very poor fairway conditions, very little grass and very muddy. I won’t go back"
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Was ok, fairways are in rough shape greens rolled true. Nice course but I dont care for the layout"
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Parking lot was so full, we had to park across the street. I arrived 12:00p for our 12:45p tee time to hit the range beforehand. No carts available, so I walk back to my car across the street to get my clubs and walk to the range. Coming back to the clubhouse at 12:40 with my group to find we still do not have any carts. We did not receive both carts until 1:10. Had groups behind and in front of us all day."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Outside of the lack of planning on this day, a very beautiful course that provides a little of everything."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"My friend and I played Saturday June 30th, tee time was at 8:36. A few groups let us play through on the front nine got a little backed up on the 10th tee but once they got in front us we didn't have to wait long. Very enjoyable round. Greens were in fantastic shape. Well worth the money."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"It was my first time out this year. The fairways are narrow, but with the white tee box placement, they were fair. The course is well kept with undulating greens."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"This was the first time I’ve played Foxcliff and it was one of the most enjoyable rounds I’ve ever played. It’s a beautiful and challenging course.The front nine and back nine are like two different courses. Beware of the slice, there are several houses very close to the course. That’s part of the challenge. And if you can’t find the fairway, the course will wear you out. I needed a nap after my round. I plan to play this course again and often."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Played this course as a $15 hot deal, and it was a steal. Carts are very nice with an on board ball/club washer. All the holes have some character to them. Conditions are improving on pace. No real ground issues. Just some weeds on their way out. Only complaint is the 10 tee is far from the club house and not very well marked. And watch out for snakes on 13! Ran into about a 4 foot water moccasin along the pond."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Course was in terrible condition. If I went in the rough I was hitting off dandelions/clover. They clearly didn’t use enough weed killer and/or didn’t spray the entire course. The pace was awful as well. It took 2 of us 5 hours to finish a round as a result of golfers ahead. I came in 2017 and loved it. I’ll wait till 2019 to try it again.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Very nice. Course. Much improved from last season regarding fairways. Geese RoblesSeems to be under control at least on front 9. Will definitely lay here more often.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,We played on Apr 13 but if felt more like Nov 13 the wind was steady 30 mph with gust to 45-50 mph and the temp was about 68 degrees. The temp and the good course conditions made it bearable. For as bad as our spring has been the course was very playable. We had a great time.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,I enjoy the front much more than the back.We are average golfers. We played from the whites and shot 84 and 82. Not to long.The greens have subtle breaks. Fun
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Truly magnificent! I hate when things are oversold but the day was great, the course was in good shape, the course was absolutely gorgeous.A couple of breath taking views, but #9 tee box, is pretty incredible. Right up there with, I think, #7 at Coffin, where you're at the elevated tee box overlooking the White River.Go play it for yourself."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,The course was in great shape and the staff was great to work with.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Course was in good shape the greens were excellent would play again
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Course was in relatively good shape for August heat. Only a few patchy areas. A couple fairway sections are ground under repair. Many greens undulating and tough putting lines. Grass on the greens was long and a bit hairy making for varying speed putts and hard to read breaks. Would like to play them cut shorter and rolled smoother. There were very few ball marks and in mostly good condition. Holes hadn't been moved in a while and the grass was growing into the cups. Beautiful tee shots and different tee positions can play short or long for different skill levels. Only a few groups playing around us on a Sunday afternoon and the two of us played in under 3 hours.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Back 9 was an afterthought. Front is long and challenging. Back is still ft just completely different. You do have a bit of a drive on the cart between the front and back. Overall, enjoy playing here."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,The fairways and greens were in excellent shape. There's a reason you need to keep it in the short grass. If you miss the fairway good luck finding your ball. There were dandelions all over in full seed. It was very difficult to find a round white ball among all the round white seed balls. They are working hard to keep the course in shape and I will play there again this year but the course needs a large dose of WEED BE GONE!!!
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,I was able to play 18 as a single in 1:40. That's about all I can say that was really positive about the course.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"The course has 2 distinct 9's. The front has some elevation change and is tight at times. The back is in a neighborhood or creek bed most of the way. They need more signs getting you from 9 to 10 since you drive through the neighborhood on neighborhood streets (there are a couple signs, could use more). Front greens were top dressed when I played, but they have more tilt than the back. Back had more water around though not always in play. Condition was nothing special, greens on the back had bare patches, fairways were a bit chewed. Nothing about the design really stood out in a positive way. The greens are small which perhaps leads to a higher slope rating (something they proudly advertise)."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Seems like most of the clientele is locals who drive their own cart to the course. It's good for that, but not for a drive out of your way, even at the hot deal rate, unless you know you can get around quick."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Nice course with a mix of challenging par 4's and shorter par 5's weaved in. If you can get the Golf Now Hot Deal on the course, its amazing value."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Winter golf is what it is . . . but love the layout. Greens need a little work this Spring. Played it last summer and the greens were excellent so I expect things to improve. Highly recommend it.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Staff very friendly and course was in great shape. Hard to believe that the place was not busy for the nice weather conditions. We are looking forward to are next round here
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Played this course 3 or4 times a year has been a very nice course. Fairways were not playable. Hope they can get it turned around.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Found a Hot Deal on this course - $13 for 18/cart! Weather was perfect - 75 degrees sunny little breeze.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Staff was very friendly. Greens were in fantastic shape - true rolls everywhere. Bunkers had the best sand I'd ever hit out of - I got up and down for par TWICE from the sand (first time ever with 2 sandies). My playing partner mentioned it might be crushed limestone. perfect blend of softness, firmness. Fairways were a little burned out - they were watering fairways while we played. An old-timer there mentioned something about the Poanna (sp) creeping in."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Front nine has rolling hills. Back nine plays through a neighborhood. Challenging course but not ridiculously hard. Par 4's are relatively longer (380-410) but 2 short par 4's on back (285 & 312).
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Didn't play my best but REALLY enjoyed the course. Had a hot dog after the round and they brought out honey-mustard pretzels to go with it. Nice touch.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"We enjoyed playing this pretty course. It was in good shape, especially the greens. We plan to return and play again."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Was able to book this course for just $14.49 including tax, fees, and 18 holes with cart! What a bargain!! I have played here in a couple of tournaments over the last 6 yrs. It continues to be a well groomed course. Playable and yet challenging at the same time. I definitely recommend playing here. And for under $15 you can't beat it."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"This course is set in a splendid area and is really, a nice ""off of the beaten path "" type place. Tee box's were good, scenery was great. Greens were very rough. The Grass was good on the greens, but the surface was almost unputtable. They should tell players that the greens are that rough before the head out to play. All in all I liked it and look forward to playing it when the greens are in better shape."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Course was in very good shape despite the dry weather we've had lately. I love the layout.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Beautiful course, friendly staff and other than some casual water from all the rain it is in great shape. would highly recommend to anyone"
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"My first time playing this course and I liked it a lot but it needs a facelift. Parking lot needs repaving, cart paths need to be repaired or repaved, the traps are the hardest sand I've played in and the clubhouse could be freshened up a bit. Fix the above and you could chargea much higher greens fee. The course itself was in great shape and has a very nice layout surrounded by beautiful homes."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Love this course, Only down fall is the food, not enough selections. poor condiment selection."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Played this course a lot in the last year or so and it has greatly improved. Layout is good. Greens were a little firm but they were smooth and a good speed. Friendly staff and good food!
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Very nice course for the money. Would like to have seen the greens in a little better shape.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"on 5/15/15, I purchased a round at this club, recieved the conformation email from this club, up on ariving at the course, the head Professional told me that I was not allowed to play this course! I would first like to say that I was a Trial Member last year and opted to not continue on with the membersip. I am told that there is verbage that states a former member may not play the course for 12 months after opting out of a membership. (this was part of the ""Private Club agreement"" ). I asked the Pro if this course is open the public and was told that they are now a Semi-private course and that they are open to the public but not to me. I'm now asking the Golf Now people, is this the kind of golf course you want to represent?"
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"This course is a hidden gem. If you have not played it yet, you are missing out. The front nine is a challenging Pete Dye layout. This is a very beautiful course with rolling hills and water on several."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"The greens are very fast and undulating. Most holes require an accurate drive to avoid being blocked on your 2nd shot. The cart paths leave something to be desired, but it was a very enjoyable round."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Course is very fun some challenging holes but for most part set up allowed for very low scoring. Greens were in perfect condition they were tuff to read but fun. It had rained a lot greens were slow and fairways soupy but would like to play again when dry. I drove 1:30 min to play and would do it again.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Course is suffering some from a summer of play. Greens needed water making speed a problem since the surface was hard near the hole. Leaves were plentiful slowing our speed as we looked for balls. Bunkers needed work, a few impossible to play from. People are always great there."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Better keep it straight off the tee or your second shot options will be very limited. Greens are fairly quick with lots of undulation. Fun course to play.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"This is a very nice, older course. The course has large trees, lots of water, and poses a challenge to golfers with a wide range of skills."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Great course and great staff , lots of elevation changes on front make for a challenge. green are true and smooth"
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,We had a great time. There were two foresomes ahead of us and the pro put them on other holes so we could get started. There was no one behind or in front of us. We play fast and sis not have to wait on anyone.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Greens are faster than most of the good courses South of Indy -- a nice treat.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"The normal rates for this course are high, but if you can snag something under $25 thru HOT DEALS on golfnow, then it's worth your time."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"We played the back tees -- 6800 yards -- and it was definitely challenging. Again, let me say, the greens will kick your butt, and you will 3-putt many times."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Very enjoyable round. Nice facility and friendly staff
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Enjoyed the course, some sand traps in need of work, but overall the course was in good shape. Friendly pro shop, nice atmosphere for a beer after the round."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Can't complain much about this course. Fairways were clean. Rough wasn't too long - you could still find your ball in it. Greens are in decent shape. I will come back!
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,played before will play again plays good pace nice course tips can be tough friendly staff course in good condition
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Very good golf course in all aspects. Friendly staff, solid & fair test of golf, well maintained; really fun to play. If you haven't played this one before then catch it on a great GolfNow rate & you won't be disappointed."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,This is my home course and its predictably excellent in all areas!
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,the only thing I would say is that the cart path just a little rough. course in great shape
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"was a good layout, challenging greens but several bunkers were just mud,Make sure you wear collared shirt."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"I guess all the central Indiana courses are lush this year, but they are not all country quiet. The only noise is from the gas carts. My only complaint is the roughness of the cart paths. Everything else is in great shape. The rough is long enough to penalize without hiding the balls."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"The course was in decent shape; however, when you make a tee time, it is expected that you would be able to begin around that tee time. Our tee time was at 11:37am. The course did not have enough golf carts for the amount of tee times so we had to sit around and wait. We did not tee off until a little after 1pm. We paid full price and were delayed well over an hour. The front desk did offer to provide our foursome with two large bags of balls to hit at the range before playing 18 but we declined. We will think twice before playing this course again."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"This is the second time this year I've played at Fox Cliff and I really enjoyed it. The course was challenging enough to be enjoyable, the pace of play was fantastic and the course is in great condition. Its closer than you think to the South side of Indy and is a great value for the money."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Excellent. Would play again. Enjoyed the entire course.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Course is in great shape. Stand traps need a bit of work ( same as most Indy courses). No one on course so it was awsome. People are friendly and nice quiet community. Snack bar drinks are awsome.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Got a fantastic last minute deal at a beautiful course. The staff was very friendly and their food value was great!
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,The course that it is easy to go because it is relatively cheap.Because this course has a lot of distanceI improve my ability.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,I would go back and play it again. I think the only concern for me was I filed a foursome around for 8 holes and on the ninth hole they let me play through as a single. I never could figure out why it took them 8 holes. Course was in great shape staff was very friendly and I enjoyed my round thoroughly. Greens are very challenging and I believe I will play a little better the next time.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Very challenging course.. front 9 was tight, ans back 9 a little more open.. evryone who works there is super friendly, and i will be coming back for years to come"
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Very impressed with the greens. Very well kept. Plan on bringing friends back.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"For the money, its hard to beat this course. My golf partners and I had heard that the course had damage from a storm early in the year, that information was wrong ! Glad we went to check it out first hand. Foxcliff is a very picturesque course."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"This course is no slack - Although challenging it is a very comfortable course. The greens are increasingly difficult, the greens keeper tends to make some cuts that are quite challenging, but that makes it fun. The course is pretty forgiving on most holes and you can avoid trouble that way; green side bunkers are ok, some what a crushed white limestone while others still have a traditional sand, the traditional sand is about like hitting off a concrete pad, so I would recommend them being raked (with the machine) daily; Also sprinklers soaked my cart while playing a round during the mid afternoon time slot."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"The golf course was in very good condition, and the greens were the best I have seen in several years. Still a little wet in spots, but the course was fun to play."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Challenging golf course. Always in good condition. Great value for the money. Great layout. I would highly recommend this course to everyone.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Challenging, but fair, course. Well maintained fairways and greens. Nice layout and scenery."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"It's been years since I've played Foxcliff and most of the course was just as nice as I remember. One huge problem, many of their greens were in horrible shape. Not sure why, but many brown spots, many bare spots, etc. The course had taken on a lot of rain in the couple days prior to paying. I did get a hot deal so it was WELL worth the money even though the greens were hurting."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Staff was fantastic!
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"We had a 7:00 tee time so we arrived at 6:30 planning to hit some balls; the clubhouse didn't even open until 7:45; thoughtful members helped us get carts, we finally teed off shorty before 8:00."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"this is the fifth time I have played this course, it was in the bad shape."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"pros: pretty landscape, nice staff"
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"cons: does not drain, greens have too many bare spots for recent weather, bunkers need a lot of work, poor yardage markers and lack of them, going from #9 to # 10 tee not marked ."
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,Even after all the rain their geens look bad. Ruins decent place.
Foxcliff Golf Club,5861-foxcliff-golf-club,"Great layout, but i understand why its not private anymore... Cart paths were in serious need of repair, bunkers were in terrible condition except for a few that had been filled with ground up lime stone, tee boxes were in good shape as were the greens except only a few of the greens had been mowed and all of the cup's had not been cut in since last year. I liked the course and got a good deal to play it from Golfnow.com, but it needs some attention!"
Deer Valley Golf Course,5627-deer-valley-golf-course,New owners as of Dec 2016. Will be updating course information!! Check us out!!
Deer Valley Golf Course,5627-deer-valley-golf-course,"definitely not the best course around, but for the money it's certainly a good value. The greens are exceptionally hard. Pretty wide open fairways though."
Deer Valley Golf Course,5627-deer-valley-golf-course,Played 27 holes ( 3 nines ). Got better each nine. Tough to keep ball on the green ! Will definitely be back
Deer Valley Golf Course,5627-deer-valley-golf-course,"Easy course great for beginners, although the greens are very rounded ."
Deer Valley Golf Course,5627-deer-valley-golf-course,NO ALCOHOL SOLD AND NONE ALLOWED IN PREMISES
Deer Valley Golf Course,5627-deer-valley-golf-course,It's decent.Wish there were more yardage markers.Good course to practice and learn on.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"42$ for 18 holes at this course is absolutely ridiculous. This course is worth about half of that with the condition that it’s in. Carts suck, no such thing as a cut fairway. No deal for the greens being aerated. Not worth the money at all."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,Bunkers are mud pit's. Needs grass in some places. Overall really nice if not for the bunkers.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"I have played this course for 3 years and today was the best condition it has been to date. the fairways and greens were in good shape ..the layout is good, but the back 9 has a multitude of trees that require straight shots off the tee to have a good look at the flag... Hole 10 is blind and narrow with hazards on the right due to changing elevations , best to stay straight or slightly left to avoid trouble. Overall its a nice course to play especially if you play during the week through the Tee off app."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,Very playable but still needs some work. Greens could be a little faster. A few narrow fairways. Not many water or sand hazards. Pace of play was great. Decent value for the money. Staff very friendly and outgoing.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"Can't imagine what course these other reviewer's played, but it certainly wasn't this one! Course is in lousy shape with long uncut fairways, debris all over poorly maintained greens and some guy named Jack who acted like a little child, when all we asked was directions to another hole on a very oddly laid out course! Everyone in our group agreed we won't be back to this one."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,Greens very receptive but a little long which slowed the greens down. Fairways in great shape. Surrounding courses are pretty burnt up with hard greens. Definitely play again this year.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,The new ownership has really taken the time to fix what we’re bad playing conditions. The course is the best I’ve seen it in years. It’s worth playing if you live near by but it’s not weekends $45 green fee worthy. $35-37 based on other courses in close proximity is where the price point should be.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,The course is in better condition than I have seen it in several years. The staff has definitely put in a lot of work to get this course to where it is now. Great job!
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"Course was in decent condition, definitely in better shape than last time I played it (last year). I think it would help if some trees on 3 and 13 were trimmed back that cover the fairways, would make the holes play a little more fair for beginners and weekend hacks. But it’s a return trip for sure."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,Good course. Helpful staff and good pace of play. Used a deal I found on the app to play 18 for $27 and got more than enough fun out of the course.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,Book tee rime on Golf Now app. They said system was down when we arrived and had to pay $45 a man to play.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"I really liked the layout. Challenging, but fun. Wish fairways & tee boxes would of been mowed, surprising for a Saturday. Overall, I enjoyed my round. Friendly staff."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,For the cost to play the value is excellent. One of the better courses I've played on the south side of Indy.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"Course is in absolutely terrible shape. From tee to green, it's the worst we've ever seen it. Really not even playable, years ago was a very nice course..An embarrassment now. Done playing here as are others we talked with."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,short staff slow on service or not where the employee needed to be for service
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,They need more help. We went to the bar to grab a quick snack at the turn. It ended up being one hour before we got back on the course. One person was running around in circles trying to do everything.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,We found a deal on this course and took a chance. It was a fantastic course! Make sure you have your confirmation because their system did not show our reservation. Staff was nice and course was enjoyable!
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,Nice layout you must be able to hit it straight. Of you play poorly its a great layout. Bunkers need work everything else was great they need a marshall and to stock the proshop with the basics like balls. I will definitely play again.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"Everyone in our group agreed this is the worst course we have ever played. Weed filled tees and fairways and greens that are inconsistent, and poorly maintained, some of which even have mold. Overall condition very poor. Not sure what course these other reviewers played but sure doesn't fit the horrible conditions our group experienced. Waste of time and money, won't be back."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,It was huge difference between score card and actual.Most teeing area has been moved forward.So it had much frustrations.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,The course is nice for the money. Drought has been no friend. If your wanting PGA golf stay away. But if your an average player on a budget it’s a good course. Greens were slow to average speed. Sand traps could use new sand.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"This course clearly needs a new superintendent, if they even have one. The course is in absolutely terrible shape and gets worse each time we play, and this has been an ongoing problem for 5 or so years now! This round will be our last one here. Years ago, this course was in very nice shape, how they have allowed it to fall so far is hard to understand. A complete embarrassment and they should be ashamed! We are done playing here. Absolutely disgusting."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"Fairways looks like mowed fields not grass, not an exaggeration either. Not we’ll taken care of by any means, even the greens had dried out dead spots."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"This is my home course i play about 20 × a year. Its going thru different ownership right now. Not sure if that's the reason for poor condition of the course or maybe the lack of rain. Hardly ever see the sprinkler system working. Hope the new owners do a better job. The clubhouse is nice, the course layout can be challenging due to the failure of cutting or trimming trees. This course has potential under someone who cares."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,The course was in a very playable condition. The greens were in good condition. The rough was challenging but not out of control. To me it is a tough driving course. I would play there again.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,I got the $28 hot deal...extra $3 in fees and could have played here for $25. Frustrating.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"The greens were great best Ive seen all year anywhere.. You can tell they are trying to get the fairways back to greatness! New management, give them a year and the course will look amazing!"
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,Layout is a bit confusing. We had to wait 30 minutes because they let a bunch of walk-ins golf in front of us.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,The course is now called River View. I think they are making improvements.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,very dry in some locations. They need more signs on where the next hole is.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,The course was in great shape. The pond with fountain looks so nice on hole 7. New markers along the cart paths are good. A couple of long par 5’s with some challenging par 3’s and 4’s make for a fun day of golf! Sand traps were in great shape. Good price on a pretty golf course.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"I stopped playing this course because of the course conditions over the past few years. I saw a good deal on golfnow and only live a mile away and I had heard they put some money into it, so I gave it a shot. Man was i surprised, the clubhouse is much improved , the course is in great condition. Now if they just keep the prices right and the floods away, this place will be worth playing a bit more. Keep up the good work."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"The news course owners have improved the course. Great price, great pace of play. Great value for yhe price."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"Even though it was cart path only, we had a good time. Rain had caused flooding, but that couldn’t be helped. The new ponds with fountains add to the beauty of this course. For the money, it was a great deal!"
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,The course is in the best shape since it was the Elks Country Club.. The greens have really improved. The lakes are an eye appealing improvement and the improvements in the club house are very nice also. There are still some rough spots but if they make as much progress this summer as last it will be a great course again that makes you use every club in your bag.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"Very fun, challenging course but the layout is a little confusing. Got in a hurry during the back 9 and ended up accidentally skipping a hole or two."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"Course was dryer than a bone. First time playing here. Played 18 for less than $20, so that was nice, but the course conditions made it too hard for anyone to have success. Made for a long day. I would not go back."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"Just quit after only 9 of 18 holes and i can honestly say this is the worst course i have ever played. The majority of fairways have no grass and those that do are mostly weeds and the tees not much better. The greens were poorly maintained as well with debris, poorly set cups and no consistency or shot holding ability whatsoever..... Does this place have a maintenance staff? Never have i been so appalled at the overall conditions of a golf course in my 40 years of playing! Don't waste your money here.."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"i had been eyeing this course for a long time, and it was on a list of courses I wanted to play. From the Hi-way the course looked good, but the fairways you don't see you can""t see. It was hard to distinguish the fairways from the rough and the Tee boxes were just as bad. for a course that has been around as long as this one I expected much better conditions."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"Each time we play the course seems to get worse. The conditions were so bad we picked up after only 9 holes and demanded a refund! Terrible greens with old and new ballmarks everywhere and old cup holes lower than the rest of the green. Missing grass and weeds everywhere. We got teamed up with some members who were not happy either and were informed a key individual left for another job at the end of the 2014 season and its been downhill ever since. Things got so bad the pro, who was also the general manager, left at the end of the 2015 season. How in good faith they can charge for conditions such as this is hard to understand. NEVER AGAIN!!!!"
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"This was our first and last round here. NOTHING was good about it. Lousy greens, tees and fairways. Missing grass and weeds were the rule throughout the course. A complete and total lack of anything that resembles a well maintained course. Pathetic!"
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,Greens we okay. But you couldn't tell the difference between the ruff and fairways. Lots of weeds and missing grass was a theme of the fairways. They really need to work on this.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,Save yourself a lo of heartache and don't play this course. Everything about the course is bad.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"We played here five times last year and the course was in outstanding condition. We just played for the first time this year and the course was horrible. Very inconsistent greens and the fairways are longer than our grass at home. Our golf cart was a nightmare bucking and shaking the whole time. It seems as if they might be under new management because they have taken a major step backward compared to the past few years. With other decent courses to play, can't see any reason to come back here even if it was free. What a shame."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,Course was is decent condition considering the recent flooding they have experienced.Staff was very easy to work with because they had five people booked with the same tee time.They got it fixed quickly.This course can be very tough on you if you aren't hitting it the way you should be.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"We drove down from indy to play golf during the day and hit the casino after the round. Big mistake. Way overpriced for the conditions. Debris on most of the greens combined with ball marks new and old everywhere. The golf carts were junk and would not even run most of the time. Very odd layout and when we asked a worker for directions, we were told if we cant find our way around we should not be there!!! Very unprofessional. We suspect he may have had a few to many drinks. We picked up and left never to return and have told our friends, some who have played here, about our experience and they had issues here as well and are now playing elsewhere also."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"Everyone in our group are regular players and we all agreed this is by far the most dangerous course we have ever played. We were nearly hit on several occasions throughout the course. Lots of tees VERY close to greens on other holes. On some holes to get to the next tee one has to drive right in front of other tees, some of which are elevated. The low skill level of golfers this course apparently attracts, means errant shots are everywhere. Anyone wishing to play this course would do well to carefully review their insurance policy beforehand. This combined with unevenly mowed greens with no consistency and a run in with a jerk course worker makes this club one to stay away from."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"The staff were super nice and helpful. The course condition was excellent. Lots of good scenery, the Blue River winds through the course and coupled with many course trees presents a very challenging play."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"Bear Chase was a fun course to play. it had a variety of holes, elevation changes etc. it had several tight driving holes. the bunkers were not playable so we dropped out of them(we are told they are the next project). the greens rolled well. the staff was very helpful."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"Greens were in great shape, course in a lot better shape then the past"
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"thanks to golfnow,i got a good deal for this course,course was in good condition,pace of play was good,staff was friendly,whenever you can play golf with friends it's always a good time!!!"
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"A few very challenging holes and some that set you up for a very achievable birdie. Some very long par 5s but some very short par 4s. The gentleman in the pro shop was very professional. Upon walking inside, he immediately went and grabbed carts for us. Fun course except for the 550 yard (white tees) par 5 that runs adjacent to a busy road."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"By far, this course is in the best shape it has EVER been in. The greens were the best we have played all year, and this includes some ""high end"" courses we played in Indy. The fairways even rolled nice and looked great! A remarkable improvement!"
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,I will most definitely be playing there again in the future
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,We really enjoyed playing golf at Bear Chase and plan to return there again. The course was in great shape and the price was unbelievable! Thanks
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,This course has quite a few holes that shot shaping is a must. There are a few dogleg lefts and elevated tees. Not your average rural GC. This course offers plenty of ways to erase your mistakes.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,I played in a golf outing here and myself and everyone else i spoke with were really impressed with the course conditions. The greens were fantastic and really held shots well. Considering a membership for next year. Just be sure to hit it straight off the tees!!
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,I have played here often and have always had an enjoyable experience.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"My group found the course to be in pretty good shape. The greens were real nice and the fairways seemed fine to us. Some crabgrass here and there but this time of year to be expected, but no big deal. Compared to what this place looked like five or so years ago it's come a long way. Our group had a fun time and will return."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"I have enjoyed a range of courses from luxury/private/championship to affordable municipal/public in 28 years of golfing. I have never been so appalled by an overall golf experience and course condition in my life! There was a little miscommunication between the Golf Channel and the Pro Shop so our original tee time was moved from 12:51pm to 2:00pm which became 2:31. I can overlook that; although disappointing, because proper expectations were communicated earlier in the week. Despite the fact that my mother was in danger as she tried to grab a snack at the turn because of an unruly bar fight and drunk women from the morning outing using the restroom with the stall door open; the course was in terrible shape. Fairways, tee-boxes, and the rough were indistinguishable. Our entire group was disappointed with the condition of Bear Chase Golf Course."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,I have played this course every labor day weekend for several years. The layout of the course is beautiful and there are many challenges through out the 18 holes. Each year however the amount of grab grass and weeds in the fairways and on the tee stations have become very bad. The greens remain in great condition and the overall experience is a good one
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"I played as a two-some. There were not a lot of other golfers on the course. There was however, a group of 12, two groups of 7 and two groups of 5. Most of the groups let us play through until we got to the group of 12. We played the front nine in 1.5 hours however we played the back nine in 3.5 hours. It was very slow and very frustrating. I understand it was a busy weekend for golf but a little scheduling could have went a long way. Also the fairways are hard to distinguish from the rough. Overall the course is a great place if you want to play with 10 other golfers and all go off at the same time. There were some pretty cool par 3's and multiple par 5's. Could be a great course."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,Really good coarse to play will continue to go back never feel rushed to play nice and opened holes very good for beginners and they also have a great driving range
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,This course should win the most improved course award. I played here five years ago and not sure if it's run by the same people but they have made huge gains in the quality of the greens and the overall condition of the place. I lost a wedge and asked a worker if he had seen it and he took the time to backtrack the course and found the club for me! Wish i had gotten his name but he was a HUGE guy and very friendly. Even gave me some balls he had on his cart. This guy went the extra mile for our group and made for a really great time. We will be back!
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,House has good layout but still recovering from flooding tee boxes are pretty sad fairways and geens need work.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"I stopped playing this course back in 2010 due to horrible conditions, but thought i would give it another try. What a improvement! The greens are some of the best i've played and the fairways were awesome! My only complaint was the guy in the proshop, who was standing outside smoking when i walked up, seemed annoyed that i was cutting his smoke break short and was not at all friendly. Almost turned around and left but glad i didn't as they really have made major improvements to the course itself. Can't wait to play again!"
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,Enjoyed the round. Course has a lot of character. Great value
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"Nice course, friendly staff, all in all good course for the money"
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,I walked in and they had leagues starting in 45 minutes. I was told it would get backed up but still could play even though I should not have been allowed to book the time I did on Golf Now. We took off in a hurry in cart 56. The condition of the cart was terrible. It probably should have been retired 3-5 years ago. The roof was cracks and the whole top rattled when it was moving. The gas motor would sputter and shake every time we took off and stop. I had a headache after we stopped. I'm glad we only played nine. We have played here a few times and hopefully it will be better next time.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,I was surprised of the course from what I have heard from others in the past. I have been told the course is not that great. I have to disagree. I will definitely return to bear chase and tell all my hacking buddies they need to give this course a try. I also like the scorecard lay-out
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"The course was very fun to playSome general maintenance is needed to the greens, the food could have been much fresher, and even though I got a great deal for my round some payed $40 per round which I found ridiculous."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,Golf was great and the staff was awesome. Very accommodating. There was an outing there and the course was closed. Golfnow was notified by.the pro earlier in the week but we could still book our tee time. The pro was very nice and let us mix in with the outing. Next time I use golf now I am going to call ahead so we dont get in this predicament again...I was not pleased with my golfnow experience but was very satisfied with the.staff at Bear Chase. Great tract!
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,Course was not straight at all. Woods like every hole. If you want a scenic course this is it. Trying to shoot good golf scores try somewhere else.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"I was disappointed with my experience at Bear Chase. The tee boxes were too close together and very confusing. A lot of blind shots from the tee box and woods and trees everywhere. Leaving the course all 4 of us said we would never come back, especially for the price."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"great staff, always friendly, definitely recommend , fast pace, great course for money"
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,Some interesting holes. Crabgrass throughout the course. Tee boxes need attention. Greens were in OK shape. I received a deep discounted price so I was not overly disappointed. Had I paid full price I would have been upset.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"Course is in need of some attention. Most of greens were ok, but a little spotty with bare patches. Fairways on several holes are made of weeds and not grass. Bunkers are terrible. Tee boxes are full of weeds and require attention.This course could be nice if money was spent on maintenance.The course has nice layout, and good mixture of easy and challanging holes.Would not recomend at this time due to course conditions. Could be nice course if they could control weeds and spend little money on maintenance."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,It was OK for 10 bucks but lot of sand seeds on the greens. Bunkers where first and seemed every shot was off really hard ground including around greens and fairways. Plus the decided to water the greens at 1 in the afternoon in the middle of the round changing the speeds and having to wait to play a shot
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"A few of the holes play alongside the highway, so passing cars and trucks can be distracting. Some of the holes are interesting in their design, and the elevated tee boxes on some holes are fun. However, wayward shots are easily lost in rough, bushes, trees and brush. Anything off the fairway is potentially lost. My son and I lost more balls at Bear Chase than we have anywhere else. Some fairways are too close together, causing delays when one group must wait for another group to play. Finally, some parts of the layout are just plain confusing. The holes are not laid out in a logical order, which sometimes makes finding the next hole a bit of an adventure."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"Greens were nice, but had some patchy portions around the edges. Fairways were a little hairy, but not bad. Course is tight, but a little short. All around a good experience and fun course."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"lower part of course needed work, but the upper was in great shape and well maintained!!"
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"Rained throughout day and poured for 40 straight minutes. We requested a rain check but they would not because ""only can do this if the course closes"". We we literally the only foursome after the hard rain, and the only car in the parking lot after a 5 1/2 hour wet round. We would have really enjoyed driving back to Indy and rescheduling. Course looks like it would be fun under normal circumstances."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"Greens need attention, fairways need attention, layout was confusing. Could be a nice course."
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"This is a tight course. Many holes are tree lined on both sides. You have to keep it straight, even if you have to sacrifice distance.The greens are quick and even though we have had quite a bit of rain this year, they are not holding well. Many shots will roll to the back edge.Overall, its in good shape. A few muddy patches in the rough and some slight damage on the greens around some edges... nothing serious. B+"
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,Four of us played May 30th. and enjoyed the course. It is a challenging course with easy holes and difficult ones also. We enjoyed playing here. We will recommend this one to our friends.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"The hole layout crisscrossed back and forth across the course, which was fine... But more markers should be used to guide us which way to go. Very easy to get lost and turned around!"
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,Desk and bar staff were great. The course itself is well maintained and challenging without being frustrating for an average player.
Bear Chase Golf Club,5950-bear-chase-golf-club,"It's a real shame that a property and layout like this was so neglected. The course has a cool layout with a lot of potential....big old trees, a river winding through, drastic elevation changes....but it was easily the worst course I have ever played. The fairways were not mowed...in fact on some holes it didn't even seem like they had fairways because the grass had not been mowed in a couple weeks. Half of the greens were un-puttable either because they were so long or sandy or burnt out. On the tees, it was hard to get my ball teed high enough so that the grass wouldn't interfere. Weeds all over. Very few, if any yardage markers on the course (luckily I had my phone but it almost didn't matter). Like I said, if it was maintained it would be a nice enjoyable challenge, but as is, I wouldn't even pay $10 to play it again. A real shame."
